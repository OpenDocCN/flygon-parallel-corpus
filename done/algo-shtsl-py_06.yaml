- en: The most pertinent risk metric for trend-following strategies is to compare
    cumulative profits and losses. This is the gain-to-pain ratio, also commonly known
    as the profit factor or profitability factor, favored by the prophet Jack Schwager.
    It states that when cumulative profits in the numerator exceed losses, the ratio
    is above 1, and vice versa for loss-making strategies. This is yet another version
    of the arithmetic gain expectancy, as a ratio instead of a delta.

    inefficiencies. Mean reversion strategies essentially capture the time it takes
    for inefficiencies to correct. For example, the price of a warrant may look cheap
    compared to its underlying stock. Over time, prices will converge, and the gap
    will close. They often have low-volatility, consistent performance. They perform
    well during established markets: bull, bear, or sideways. The markets of predilection
    for mean reversion strategies are typically sideways phases where prices oscillate
    in semi-predictable fashions. They may find bull or bear phases more challenging,
    but there is ample empirical evidence of talented managers performing in those
    markets. Again, risk management is what separates the pros from the tourists.'

    long high beta, short low beta will do wonders in a bull market but will give
    back a lot of performance as the regime transitions to sideways and bear. The
    darlings of the last bull market sometimes lead the way down in the ensuing bear
    market. They also perform poorly during tail events. Short gamma funds performed
    well for years until they spectacularly blew up in three weeks during the 2008
    GFC.

    This is why it should be range-bound via the limit. Note that the tail ratio is
    a lot less responsive than the profit ratio we saw earlier. This ratio does not
    apply to trend following strategies. It is so consistently high that the limit
    had to be lowered to the 5th and 95th percentile to be visible. This goes to illustrate

    but a little formula we learned back in school called gain expectancy. Now, it
    turns out that strategies with a positive trading edge tend to fall into two buckets.
    This happens regardless of time frames, asset classes, instrument, and market
    phases. Market participants expect inefficiencies to either correct and revert
    to the mean, or to persist and form trends. Those strategies are mutually exclusive.
    They have opposite payoffs and risk profiles.

    we can come up with better ways to engineer a superior trading edge. Now that
    we understand how those strategies behave, the next step is to roll up our sleeves,
    pop the hood, and tune up the signal engine.

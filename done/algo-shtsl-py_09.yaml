    look at the total amount of money in their account. They do not care about the

    for the fund managers, not the pensioners. When market participants allocate assets

    in a vehicle that loses money over time?" Welcome to your average **mutual fund**.
    Over time, fees eat performance away, causing mutual funds to underperform their
    benchmark. Yet, performance is cyclical. Sometimes, managers shoot the ball out
    of the park. The CSR is a simple way to time entry and, more importantly, exit.
    A high CSR combined with a subpar profit/gain to pain ratio is evidence of strong
    seasonality. Those products work very well some of the time but fail in the long
    run. In *Chapter 5*, *Regime Definition*, we saw several regime definition methodologies,
    which should help when identifying seasonality.

- en: This statistical measure was brought back to fame by Dr Van Tharp. System Quality
    Number SQN® is a brilliant interpretation of the time-honored t-stat. It has all
    the ingredients necessary to measure robustness. Firstly, a strategy is viable
    only if it has a trading edge. Nothing happens until gain expectancy turns positive.

- en: Secondly, it incorporates trading frequency. Making money is one thing, trading
    on the appointment is another. The more a strategy can trade while maintaining
    a positive gain expectancy, the faster returns compound. Time is the variable
    that immediately jumps to mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Market participants should lower their time frames as long as they can maintain
    a positive gain expectancy. For example, a strategy viable on daily and 4-hour
    bars will generate more signals on the lower time frame. Besides, shorter time
    frames mean tighter stop losses and bigger positions, but also noisier signals.

    when there is a change in regime: from 0 to 1 and vice versa. The `notnull()`
    method ensures that signals are counted once upon entry. From there, `abs()` counts
    all trades as one. The cumulative sum is done via `cumsum()`. Then, the `fillna`
    method fills all the missing values forward. `.diff(window)` applied to the trades
    column returns the rolling number of trades.'

    to losing days. This leaves positive returns. We calculate a moving average count
    and divide it by the window. Similarly, we calculate rolling profits and losses
    and divide them by the window.

    ratio, using gain expectancy instead of average returns. Instead, it's a very
    useful function, which incorporates both trading frequency and edge. For example,
    if a strategy makes money but trades on appointments every leap year, chances
    are investors will not stick with you. Conversely, if a strategy maintains the
    same positive edge at a lower timeframe from daily to 1 hour, it would make more
    sense to trade the lower time frame to compound profits faster.

    risk metrics that will unapologetically assess your ability to live to trade another
    day. We considered the Grit Index, which integrates drawdowns (magnitude, frequency,
    and duration). Then, we introduced the common sense ratio, which recaptures risk
    specific to both trend-following and mean reversion strategies. Finally, we looked
    at the system quality number ratio, before combining all three into a combined
    robustness score, which helps assess risk by combining trading frequency and trading
    edge.

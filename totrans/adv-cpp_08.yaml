- en: During the **Software Development Life Cycle** (**SDLC**), once the requirement
    gathering phase is complete, then generally comes the Design and Architecture
    phase, wherein the high-level flow of the project is defined and broken down into
    smaller components of modules. When there are many team members in a project,
    it is necessary that each team member is clearly assigned a specific part of the
    module and that they are aware of their requirements. This way, they can independently
    write their part of the code in an isolated environment and make sure it works
    fine. Once their part of the work is complete, they can integrate their module
    with the other developer's modules and make sure the overall project is executing
    as per the requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This concept can be applied to small projects too, where the developer is completely
    working on a requirement, breaking it down into smaller components, developing
    components in an isolated environment, making sure it executes as per the plan,
    integrating all the small modules to complete the project, and finally testing
    it to ensure that the overall project is working fine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a good amount of testing required when the whole project is integrated
    and executed. There may be a separate team (known as `IP address` as a `string`,
    then the developer needs to ensure it is in the format `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`, where
    `X` is a digit from `0`-`9`. The length of the string must be of limited size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here, the developer can create a test program that executes their part of the
    code: parsing the file, extracting the `IP address` as a string, and testing if
    it is in the correct format. Similarly, if the configuration has other parameters
    to be parsed and they need to be in a specific format such as `userid` / `password`,
    file location for the log or mount point, and so on, then all these will be part
    of the unit testing for that module. In this chapter, we''ll explain techniques
    such as `assertions`, `safety nesting` (`exception handling`), `unit testing`,
    `mocking`, `breakpoints`, `watchpoints`, and `data visualization` to pinpoint
    the source of errors and limit their growth. In the next section, we''ll explore

    develop in a better way as the flaws will be caught at a base level rather than
    at the later QA level. There may be scenarios wherein even after writing the unit
    test cases and successful execution of the code, issues may be found sch as the
    application crashing, the program exiting unexpectedly, or the behavior is not
    as expected. To overcome such scenarios, generally, a developer uses a debug mode
    binary to recreate the problem. `Asserts` are used to ensure that the conditions
    are checked, otherwise the program's execution is terminated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This way, the problem can be traced fast. Also, in `Debug Mode`, the developer
    can traverse the actual execution of the program line by line and check if the
    flow of code is as expected or if the variables are set as expected and accessed
    correctly. Sometimes, accessing pointer variables causes unexpected behaviors
    if they are not pointing to a valid memory location.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When writing code, we can check if the necessary condition is satisfied. If
    not, then the programmer may not want to execute the code further. This can be
    easily done using an assertion. An `assertion` is a macro where the specific condition
    is checked and if it doesn't meet the criteria, abort is called (program execution
    is stopped) and an error message is printed as a `standard error`. This is generally
    a **runtime assertion**. There can also be an assertion done at compile time.
    We will talk about this later. In the next section, we'll solve an exercise wherein
    we'll be writing and testing our first assertion.

    errors. For example, in a project, we may use a third-party library that has some
    data structure declared in it. This structure information, such as its `size`
    and `member variables`, are known to us from its header file. Using this information,
    we can allocate or deallocate memory correctly, as well as work on its member
    variable. This structure property may change in a third-party library with a different
    version. However, if our project code is still using the structure of the earlier
    version, then it will create a problem when we use it. We may get an error at
    a later stage when running the binary. We can catch this error at compile time
    itself using `static assertion`. We can make a comparison of static data such
    as the version number of libraries, thus making sure our code will not have to
    face any problems. In the next section, we'll solve an exercise based on this.

    generally, it is a good idea to do `unit testing` for the code. `Unit testing`
    is testing that's performed at the unit level or the base level of the code where
    a developer can test their code in an isolated environment, assuming the required

    combinations that may fail or behave incorrectly. Once these test cases have been
    identified, the developer can write code to cover the functionality and make sure
    it passes all the unit test cases. This is good practice as part of development

- en: When a developer works on unit testing, there may be scenarios wherein certain
    interfaces are called after concrete actions have taken place. For example, as
    we discussed in the preceding scenarios, let's assume that the project is designed
    in such a way that, before its execution, it takes all the configuration information
    from the database. It queries the database to get specific parameters, for example,
    the web server's `IP address`, `user`, and `password`. It then tries to connect
    to a web server (maybe there is another module that handles network-related tasks)
    or starts acting on the items that are needed for an actual project. Previously,
    we worked on testing the validity of the IP address. Now, we'll go a step further.
    Let's assume that the IP address is fetched from the database and that we have
    a utility class that handles connecting to `DB` and querying `IP addresses`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, to test the IP address' validity, we need to assume the database connectivity
    has been set up. This means that the application can query the database correctly
    and get the results of the query, one of which is an `IP address`. Only then can
    we test the IP address' validity. Now, in order to perform such testing, we must
    assume that all the necessary activities have been completed and that we've got
    an `IP address` to test. Here comes the mock object, which behaves like the real
    object. It provides the facility for unit testing so that the application is under
    the impression that the IP address has already been fetched from the database,
    but in reality, we have imitated it. To create a mock object, we need to inherit
    it from the class that it needs to imitate. In the next section, we'll walk through
    an exercise to get a better understanding of the mock object.

    desired result without creating the `ConnectDatabase` class and running a real
    query to the database. One important point that needs to be noted here is that

    the instance of a mock object as the first parameter and pass the `getResult()`

    the interface needs to be called once and will return "" and an empty string.
    This is the value that needs to be passed to the `checkValidIP` function to test
    for the empty string. This is checked with the `ASSERT_FALSE` macro. Similarly,
    other test cases can be created using the mocked object of DB and passing the
    IP address to the `checkValidIP` function. To create various test cases, the `TestApp`
    class is inherited from the `testing::Test` class, which contains the App instance
    and Mocked object of Database. Within the `TestApp` class, we have defined two
    functions, namely `SetUp()` and `TearDown()`. Inside the `SetUp()` function, we
    created a `MockDB` instance and tagged it to the testApp instance. Since nothing
    needs to be done for the `TearDown()` function, we've kept it empty. Its destructor
    is called in the destructor of the `App` class. Also, we passed two parameters

    a developer checks code into the repository branch and can be seen by other team
    members so that they can integrate it with other modules. Although unit testing
    is done well and the developer checks the code in, there may be a chance that
    whenever the code is integrated and the QA team starts testing, they may find
    a bug in the code. Generally, in such a scenario, an error may be thrown in a
    module that was caused due to changes in the other module. It may become difficult
    for the team to crack down on the real reason for such issues. In such cases,
    **debugging** comes into the picture. It tells us exactly how the code is behaving,
    and the developer can get granular information of the code's execution. A developer
    can see what parameters the function is getting and what value it is returning.
    It can tell exactly what value is assigned to a variable or a pointer or what
    the content in memory is. This becomes very helpful for the developer to identify

    point at line 11 where `displayStackStats` is called, we need to step in. The
    flow is to go to the start of the `displayStackStats` function. Also, we need
    to execute the next statement. Since the initial checks in the function are clear,
    they don't alter the value of the head and we can press *Enter* to execute the
    next steps. When we suspect that the next steps can alter the value of the variable
    that we're looking for, we need to step in. This is done in the preceding snapshot,
    highlighted in red. The latter execution comes to `line 97`, that is, the last
    line for the `displayStackStats` function.

    the clean function at line 81\. This clean command deletes the `tmp` variable,
    which has the same value as that of the head. The function empties the stack,
    which was not expected to run. It was only the `displayStackStats` function that
    was supposed to be called and executed to finally return to the main function.
    But the destructor may be called due to the local variable in the function that
    goes out of scope after the function is completed. Here, the local variable was
    the variable that was declared as a parameter to the `displayStackStats` function
    at `line 92`. So, a local copy of the `si` variable from the main function was
    created when the `displayStackStats` function was called. This variable called
    the destructor of Stack when it went out of scope. Now, the pointers from the
    `si` variable have been copied to the temporary variable and deleted the pointer
    at the end by mistake. This was not intended by the developer. Thus, at the end
    of the execution of the code, a double free error was stated. The `si` variable
    must call the Stack destructor when it goes out of scope as it will try to free
    the same memory again. To resolve this issue, it is clear that the `displayStackStats`
    function must be called with the passing parameter as a reference. For that, we
    must update the code of the `displayStackStats` function in the `Stack.h` file:'

    executables can be grabbed at compile time and runtime using asserts. We also
    learned about static assertion. We understood how exceptions are generated and
    how to handle them in the code. We also saw how unit testing can act as a savior
    to developers as they'll be able to identify any issues in the code at the beginning.
    We utilized mock objects for the classes that needed to be used in the test cases.
    We then learned about the debugger, breakpoints, watchpoints, and visualizing
    the data. We were able to locate the issues in the code using the debugger and
    fix them. We also solved an activity wherein we wrote the necessary test cases
    to check the accuracy of the functions that were used for parsing the files.

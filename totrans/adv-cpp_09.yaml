  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In today's world of extremely large and complicated software systems, `stability`
    and `maintainability` are usually considered the major goals for most software
    projects, whereas optimization has not been widely seen as a worthwhile goal since
    the 2000s. This is because of the rapid acceleration of hardware technology that
    overtook software demands on a regular schedule.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For many years, it seemed like the hardware improvements would continue to keep
    up with the performance demands of software, but applications continued to grow
    larger and more complex. Low-level native-compiled languages such as C and C++
    dropped in popularity compared to less performant but easier to use interpreted
    languages such as `Python` or `Ruby`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the late 2000s, though, the trend of CPU transistor count (and performance)
    doubling every 18 months (a consequence of `Moore's Law`) had stopped, and performance
    improvements had flattened out. The expectation of 5 to 10 GHz processors being
    widely available by the 2010s never materialized due to limitations of physics
    and manufacturing costs. However, the rapid adoption of mobile devices and the
    rise of high-performance computing applications for data science and machine learning,
    suddenly resurrected the demand for fast and efficient code. Performance per watt
    has become the new metric to aim for as large data centers consume enormous amounts
    of power. For example, Google servers in the US used more power than the entire
    nation of the UK in 2017.

    of ease of use, without sacrificing any performance potential over a traditional
    language such as C. This means we can write fast code in C++ without necessarily
    sacrificing readability or stability. In the next section, we will learn about
    the concept of performance measurement.

    these may be required. We will examine each of these approaches in the following

    algorithms in various domains, even if we are not capable of implementing them
    from scratch. A slightly deeper knowledge of algorithms will help us find parts
    of our program that perform similar, if not exactly the same, computations as
    well-known algorithms. Certain code features such as nested loops or linear scanning
    of data are often obvious candidates for improvement, provided we can verify that
    these constructs are within hotspots in the code. A **hotspot** is a section of
    code that runs very often and affects performance significantly. The C++ standard
    library includes a lot of basic algorithms that can be used as building blocks
    to improve the efficiency of many common operations.

    Another technique to make the compiler believe that a piece of code has a side

    tells the compiler: "This variable must always be read from memory and written
    to memory, and not from a register." The main purpose of a volatile variable is
    to access device memory, and such device memory access must follow the rule mentioned

    When a program is compiled with PGO enabled, the compiler adds instrumentation
    code to the program. Running this PGO-enabled executable creates a log file that
    contains information about the execution statistics of the program. The term **profiling**
    refers to the process of running a program to gather performance metrics. Typically,
    this profiling stage should be run with a real-world dataset so that an accurate
    log is produced. After this profiling run, the program is recompiled with a special
    compiler flag. This flag enables the compiler to perform special optimizations
    based on the statistical execution data that was recorded. Significant performance
    gains can be achieved with this approach. Let''s solve an exercise based on profile

    a loop – as it grows, the vector reallocates a new buffer, which is larger than
    the existing one by a certain factor (the exact value of this growth factor depends
    on the standard library implementation). In theory, this reallocation has minimal
    costs because it occurs infrequently, but in practice, the operation of resizing
    in a vector involves copying the elements of its buffer to a newly allocated larger
    buffer, which can be very expensive.

    a topic that anyone who learns computer science encounters – and there are well-accepted
    textbook definitions of the complexity of data structure operations. However,
    after 50 years since these things were analyzed, computers have evolved in a way
    that is quite different from what could have been envisaged. For example, a common
    "fact" is that the list data structures are faster for insertion operations than
    arrays. This seems like common sense because inserting an element into an array
    involves moving all the items after that point to new locations, whereas inserting
    into a list is merely a few pointer manipulations. We will test this hypothesis

    memory address is accessed, it is looked up in the L1 cache – if found, it is
    retrieved from there. If not, it is looked up in the L2 cache, if not found, then
    the L3 cache and so on – if it wasn''t found in any of the caches, it is fetched
    from memory. When fetched from memory, it is stored in each of the caches for
    faster access later. This method in itself would be fairly useless because it
    would only improve performance if we accessed the same memory address again and
    again.The second aspect, called **prefetching**, is the mechanism that can make
    caches really pay off.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prefetching is a process where, when memory access is performed, nearby data
    is also fetched into caches, even though it was not accessed directly. The first
    aspect of prefetching is related to memory bus granularity – it can be thought
    of as "What is the minimum amount of data that the RAM subsystem can send to the
    processor?". In most modern processors, this is 64 bits – in other words, whether
    you ask for a single byte or a 64-bit value from memory, the entire `machine word`
    of 64 bits that includes that address is read from RAM. This data is stored in
    each layer of cache for faster access later. Obviously, this would immediately
    improve memory performance – say we read a byte of memory at address `0x1000`;
    we also get the 7 other bytes after that address into the caches. If we then access
    the byte at address `0x1001`, it comes from the cache, avoiding expensive RAM
    access.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second aspect of prefetch takes this one step further – when the contents
    of the RAM at an address is read, the processor reads not only that memory word,
    but much more. On the x86 family of processors, this is between 32 and 128 bytes.
    This is called the **cache line** size – the processor always writes and reads
    memory in chunks of that size. When the CPU hardware detects that memory is being
    accessed in a linear fashion, it prefetches memory into one cache line, based
    on its prediction of what addresses are likely to be accessed subsequently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CPUs are very clever in detecting regular access patterns both forwards and
    backwards, and will prefetch efficiently. You can also provide hints to the processor
    using special instructions to make it prefetch data according to the programmer's
    direction. These instructions are provided as intrinsic functions on most compilers
    in order to avoid the use of inline assembly language. When a memory address is
    read or written that is not in a cache, it is termed a **cache miss**, and is
    a very expensive event and to be avoided at all costs. The CPU hardware tries
    its best to mitigate cache misses, but the programmer can analyze and modify the
    data access patterns to reduce cache misses maximally. The description of caching
    here is a simplified model for instructional purposes – in reality, CPUs have
    L1 caches for instructions as well as data, multiple cache lines, and very complex
    mechanisms to make sure that multiple processors can keep their separate caches
    in synchronization.

    high, but the cost of accessing an adjacent address subsequently is almost 0 because
    it would already be in the cache. This means that the iteration upon elements
    in a `std::list` that are located non-sequentially in memory are likely to always
    cause a cache miss, causing slow performance. On the other hand, since the elements
    of an array or `std::vector` are always adjacent, caching and prefetching would
    reduce the overall cost of copying (S-N) elements to a new location by a very
    large margin. Hence, the traditional analysis of the two data structures that
    declares that lists work better for random insertions, while technically correct,
    is not practically true, especially given the clearly sophisticated caching behavior
    of modern CPU hardware. When our programs are *data bound*, the analysis of algorithm
    complexity has to be augmented by understanding of what is known as **data locality**.

    address that was just accessed to the one that was accessed previously. In other
    words, making memory access across addresses that are far from each other is a
    severe slowdown, since data from closer addresses are likely to have been prefetched
    into the caches. When data is already present in the cache(s), it is termed "hot";
    otherwise, it is termed "cold". Code that takes advantage of the cache is termed
    **cache friendly**. Cache-unfriendly code, on the other hand would cause the cache
    lines to be wastefully reloaded (termed **cache invalidation**). In the remainder

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In many programs, we often use an array of objects of the same type – these
    could represent records from a database, entities in a game, and so on. A common
    pattern is to iterate through a large array of structures and perform an operation
    on some fields. Even though the structs are sequential in memory, if we access
    only a few of fields, a larger size structure will make caching less effective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The processor may prefetch several structs into cache, but the program only
    accesses a fraction of that cached data. Since it is not using every field of
    each struct, most of the cached data is discarded. To avoid this, another kind
    of data layout can be used – instead of using an **array of structs** (**AoS**)
    pattern, we use a **struct of arrays** (**SoA**) pattern. In the next section,
    we'll solve an exercise wherein we'll examine the performance benefit of using
    the SoA pattern versus the AoS pattern.

    Considering that the addresses of the vectors in the struct would be quite far
    apart, we may wonder why the caching behavior is better in the SoA case. The reason
    is because of how caches are designed – rather than treating a cache as a single
    monolithic block, it is divided into multiple lines, as we discussed earlier.
    When a memory address is accessed, the 32- or 64-bit address is converted into
    a "tag" of a few bits and the cache line associated with that tag is used. Memory
    addresses that are very close together will get the same tag and reach the same
    cache line. If a highly differing address is accessed, it reaches a different
    cache line. The effect of this line-based cache design on our test program is
    that it is as if we have separate independent caches for each vector.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preceding explanation for cache lines is a very much simplified one, but
    the basic concept of cache lines applies. Code readability may seem slightly worse
    for this structure of array pattern, but considering the increase in performance,
    it is well worth it. This particular optimization becomes more effective as the
    size of the structure grows larger. Also, remember that padding structures can
    inflate their size by a big factor if the fields are of various sizes. We have
    explored the performance effects of memory latency and learned a few ways to help
    the processor's caches be effective. When writing a program that is performance-critical,
    we should keep caching effects in mind. Sometimes, it makes sense to start out
    with a more cache-friendly architecture in the first place. As always, we should
    always measure the performance of code before we attempt to make radical changes
    in data structures. Optimization should be focused on the most time-consuming
    areas of a program and not every part of it.

    constraints on the input data, we can do even better. Let's assume that there
    are no non-printable characters in the file. This is a reasonable assumption for
    our input data. If we assume this, then we can simplify the condition for detecting

    for the entire program is 3.6x. We can still ask if this is the limit – indeed,
    TANSTATFC still applies and there are a few more things that can be done: instead
    of reading data into a `std::string`, use `memory-mapped I/O` to get a buffer
    that directly points to the file. This could possibly be faster than allocation
    and reading – it will require changing the word count code to accept a `const
    char*` and a length, or an `std::string_view`. Use a different, faster allocator
    to allocate memory. Compile for the native CPU using the `-march=native` flag.
    However, it seems unlikely that we will be able to get very large performance
    gains from this, since these optimizations have nothing to do with the word counting
    algorithm itself. Another final attempt could be to forego the C++ constructs

    the AVX SIMD instruction set. If the processor does not support it, a compile
    error will result. If this executable is compiled for an AVX target, and run on
    a system where the processor does not support those instructions, the program
    crashes with an "Illegal instruction" exception. There seems to be a very small
    improvement, but not significant – the effort and learning curve required to optimize
    with the assembler or SIMD is usually too high to be justified unless your application
    or industry has those demands. The SIMD version processes 32 bytes at a time –
    yet there is practically no performance improvement. In fact, if you check the
    generated assembly code for the regular C++ implementation in the other snippets
    with the compiler explorer, you will see that the compiler itself has used SIMD
    – this just goes to show how far compilers go in terms of making your code fast.

    up most of the time now – leaving aside memory allocation, we can conclude that
    our code has become **I/O bound** as opposed to **CPU bound**. This means that
    no matter how fast we write the code, it will be limited by how fast the data
    can be fetched. We started with a very simple implementation of a word count algorithm,
    increased its complexity and speed, and finally were able to go back to a very
    simple implementation that ended up being the fastest. The overall speed improvement
    for the algorithm was a factor of 40x. We used a number of approaches that ranged
    from just rearranging code a bit, to reimagining the problem in different ways,
    to performing micro-optimizations. No single approach can work all the time, and
    optimization remains a creative endeavor that needs imagination and skill and
    often, lateral thinking. As compilers get smarter and smarter, it gets harder
    and harder to outdo them – yet, the programmer is the only one who actually understands
    the code's intent, and there is always scope to make the code faster.

    is about a simple spell checker that takes a dictionary and a text file and prints
    out a list of the words in the text that are not present in the dictionary. A
    basic skeleton program is provided in `7zip archive`, that is, `activity1.7z`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Linux distributions. The text file is like the one we used in the previous exercise
    – it is the same large file we used in the word count exercise, with all punctuation
    removed and converted into lower case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the dictionary is only an example, so do not assume that all valid
    words exist in it – many of the words in the output could well be correctly spelled
    words. The skeleton code reads the dictionary and text files and calls the spell
    check code (which you will write) on it. After that, it compares the resultant
    output with the contents of **out.txt** and prints whether the program worked
    as expected. The function that does the spell check returns a vector of indices
    of the words that were not in the dictionary. Since we are focusing on only the
    spellcheck algorithm, only that code is timed. The time taken for reading the
    files and comparing the output is not taken into consideration. You will develop
    successively faster versions of this program – reference implementations are provided
    in the reference folder as **Speller1.cpp**, **Speller2.cpp**, and so on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have covered a lot of complex material in this chapter. Optimizing code is
    a difficult but necessary skill for any modern C++ developer. The demands of machine
    learning, hyper-realistic games, big data analysis, and energy-efficient computing
    make this a very vital area to learn about for any C++ professional. We have learned
    that the process of performance optimization is divided into two stages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, optimization starts with a proper performance measurement strategy,
    with test conditions mirroring real-world data and usage patterns. We have learned
    how to measure performance by various methods – studying assembler code, manual
    timing, source code instrumentation, and using runtime profilers. Once we have
    accurate measurements, we can actually understand which portions of our programs
    are actually slow and focus our efforts there to get the maximum improvements.The
    second stage involves actually modifying the program – we learned about several
    strategies, starting with using the best compiler options for our code, using
    parallelization features, and also using profile data to help the compiler, followed
    by some simple code transformations that produce small but useful performance
    gains without major code changes. We then learned about how to improve performance
    by structuring our loops and conditionals in a way that makes the code more friendly
    to branch prediction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we learned about the dramatic and significant effects of caching on performance
    and looked at some techniques, such as the SOA pattern, to make our code take
    advantage of the caches in modern CPUs. Finally, we put all these things together
    for a real-world example of a word count program and simple spell checker to practice
    what we learned hands-on. There are a lot of other advanced techniques and theory
    that need to be studied over and above the material in this chapter, but what
    we have covered here should give any student a solid foundation for future learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of these chapters, you have explored a number of topics related to
    using advanced C++. In the first few chapters, you have learned how to write portable
    software, use the type system to your advantage with templates, and learned to
    use pointers and inheritance effectively. Then you have explored the C++ standard
    library, including streams and concurrency, which are essential tools for building
    large real world applications. In the final sections, you learned how to test
    and debug your programs, and optimize your code to run efficiently. Among the
    widely used programming languages C++ is perhaps the most complex, as well as
    being the most expressive. This book is only a beginning, and would have given
    you a solid platform to continue your further learning.

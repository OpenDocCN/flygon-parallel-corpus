- en: There are many different ways to approach software design and construction.
    The two most well-known design philosophies, or programming paradigms, are **Object-oriented
    programming (OOP)** and **Functional Programming (FP)**. A programming paradigm
    is a way of thinking about software design and construction. Programming paradigms
    are based on several defining principles and are used to organize and characterize
    the design and construction of software applications. Functional Programming is
    a programming paradigm focused on building software through expressions and declarations.
    In this section, we will discuss the very basics of Object-Oriented Programming
    and Functional Programming, and compare the two programming paradigms.

    and statements. Objects are programming abstractions used to organize pieces of
    an application. In OOP, objects usually contain and store data in attributes,
    have procedures they can run in methods, and have some notion of **this** or **self**,
    a way for the object to reference itself. Generally, objects come in the form
    of classes. A **class** can be thought of as the definition of an object, with
    its attributes, methods, and **this** scope. An **object** is the instantiation
    of a class. In OOP, statements are instruction-driven code. This will be covered
    more in the *Declarative Versus Imperative* topic. Many programming languages
    work well for OOP software development. The most popular OOP languages are C++,
    Java, and Python.'

    FP relies on functions instead of objects to organize code and build applications.
    Functional Programming is thought to have originated from lambda calculus, which
    was created in the 1930s. Functional Programming relies on seven key concepts:
    **declarative functions**, **pure functions**, **higher order functions**, **shared
    state**, **immutability**, **side effects**, and **function composition**. Each
    of these concepts will be covered in a subsequent topic in this chapter.'

    but we can simplify it. An imperative approach to coding is about HOW you solve
    the problem. Consider finding a table at a restaurant. You approach the host/hostess
    and say "I see that the table in the corner is empty. My wife and I are going
    to walk over and sit down." This is an imperative approach because you describe
    exactly how you are going go from the host/hostess to getting a table for your
    party.'

    can be simplified as WHAT we need to do. Consider the restaurant example from
    the previous paragraph. A declarative approach to getting a table would be to
    approach the host/hostess and say "table for two please." We describe what we
    need, not every step we will take to get the table. Declarative programming is
    the act of conforming to the mental model of the developer rather than the operational
    model of the machine. From these definitions and metaphors, we can conclude that
    declarative programming is an abstraction of some imperative implementation.

    solution (`for` loop) by using the JavaScript array reduce operation.

    is by creating functions. These functions should abstract away the step-by-step
    nature of the imperative parts of your code. Consider array operations such as
    `find`, `map`, and `reduce`. These functions are all array member functions that
    are declarative. They abstract away the step-by-step nature of iterating over
    an array. Using them will help introduce declarative concepts into your code and
    reduce some of the imperative code that you write.

    second function, pure, we check the value passed into the function to decide what
    to return. The first function is not a pure function. It relies on a state outside

    cannot modify any objects or values passed in by reference. Side effects will
    be discussed in more detail in the *Side Effects* topic. In JavaScript, only objects
    and arrays can be passed into functions by reference. A pure function cannot modify
    these objects or arrays in any way. If your function needs to update or modify
    an array or object internally, we must first create a copy of the array/object.
    It is important to note that, in JavaScript, copying an object or array only copies
    the first level of the entity. This means that if an array or object has arrays
    or objects nested in it, these nested references will not be copied. When the
    copied object is by reference by reference, the nested objects will not have been
    copied, and will also be passed. This means that a nested reference, if not explicitly
    copied, can cause a side effect. To properly copy an object, we must create a
    deep copy. A deep copy of an object is a copy that duplicates all nested references.
    This can be done recursively or through the Node.js `deepcopy` module. An example

    objects are passed by reference, this update will be seen in all other scopes
    where the object is used. This is a side effect. The pure version of the function
    (`pure()`) creates a deep copy of the object with JSON operations and then adds
    a new property to the new object and returns the new object. Since the object
    was cloned, the original object is not modified. No side effect is created.

    steps to complete the action are to take a knife, place it over the food item,
    and press downward. Then, move the knife a short distance along the food item
    and repeat the process until no large pieces remain. Chopping is an abstraction
    of this action. It is simpler and quicker to say "chop the carrot" instead of

    function. The closure function takes in the two objects we are trying to sort
    and returns the sorting value. The second helper function, `sortObjField2`, takes
    in the field and the two objects at once and returns the sorting value. The higher
    order utility function is much more powerful because we do not need to know all
    of the values at the same time. We can pass `sortObjField( 'field' )` as a parameter
    to another function to be used in another part of the program.

    a function from being pure. When the shared state rule is violated and the program
    modifies a variable, a side effect is created. In OOP, shared states are often

    In our function called `doSomething`, we reference the variable state to make
    a logical code decision. Since the `state` variable was defined outside of the
    scope of our `doSomething` function and is not an immutable object (an object
    whose state cannot be modified after it has been created), it is considered a
    shared state. This is something that should be avoided in Functional Programming
    because it prevents our functions from being pure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shared states must be avoided for several reasons. First, a shared state can
    make it difficult to understand a function. To truly understand how a function
    works and what the output results will be given an input, we must understand the
    entire state that the function operates under. If our function uses a shared state,
    we have a much more complex state to understand before we can properly understand
    the function. It is very difficult to understand a shared state in detail. To
    properly understand a shared state, you must understand how the state is updated
    and how it is used in every function it is shared with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it may not sound like a major drawback at first, not understanding how
    our functions work will result in slower development, more bugs, and inadequate
    testing. Shared states slow down development simply because we must take more
    time to understand the functions that rely on them. If we do not take the time
    to understand the shared states and functions that rely on them, then it is likely
    that we will not write code that is efficient and bug-free. This will obviously
    lead to more time spent debugging and refactoring code. Functions that are not
    fully understood tend to be more bug-ridden. If we do not fully understand how
    the function needs to operate under all of the possibilities and limitations defined
    in the shared states, it is likely that we will forget to handle edge cases in
    our development. If these bugs are not found, then faulty code could be released.
    Finally, not understanding functions makes it nearly impossible to fully test
    a function. To fully test any function, we must understand exactly how it will
    operate under all conditions, or in other words, under all states it could be
    called under.

    The textbook definition of **immutability** is simply "something that is not changeable."
    In programming, we use the word to mean objects and variables whose state cannot
    be changed after they have been created.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In software development, values can be passed into functions by reference. When
    a variable is passed by reference, it means that a reference to the memory location
    (a pointer) is passed instead of the serialized value of the object contained
    at that location in memory. Since all of the pointers for a variable passed by
    reference point to the same block of memory, any update to the value of the variable
    passed by reference will be seen by any pointer pointing to that block of memory.
    Any variable passed by reference instead of by value can be considered a shared
    state, since it can be modified by multiple separate scopes. It is important to
    write functions that prevent the mutation of data because any change to values
    passed by reference will act as a change to the shared state. Modifying the variables
    passed by reference will violate the principles of Functional Programming and
    will lead to side effects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In JavaScript, the concept of immutability generally applies to variables that
    are passed into, and returned by, functions. In JavaScript, simple types (string,
    number, bool) are passed by value, and complex types (objects, arrays, and so
    on) are passed by reference. Any changes to these complex data types will affect
    all occurrences because they are all essentially just pointers to the same block
    of memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'JavaScript support for immutability is not very complete. JavaScript does not
    have built-in immutable arrays or objects. It is important to note that the variable
    creation keyword, `const`, will not create an immutable object or array. As discussed
    in the very first chapter, const simply locks the name binding so that the name
    binding cannot be reassigned. It does not prevent the object referenced by the
    variable from being modified. Immutable objects in JavaScript can be created in
    two ways: with the `freeze` function and with third-party libraries.'

    it will lock the element values and prevent elements from being added to or removed
    from the array. It is important to note that the freeze function is only a shallow
    freeze. Objects and arrays nested as properties (in objects) or elements (in arrays)
    will not be frozen by the `freeze` function. If you want to fully freeze all nested
    properties, you must write a helper function that traverses the object or array
    tree, freezing each nested level, or find a third-party library. The use of `Object.freeze()`

- en: There is one final way to obtain immutability in JavaScript; however, it is
    not true immutability. To avoid using third-party libraries or freezing any object
    or array passed to a function, we can simply create a copy of any variable passed
    by reference and modify the copy instead of the original. This will prevent the
    shared state issue of passing data by reference, but it comes with a memory efficiency
    and inefficiency trade-off. Simply assigning the reference to a new variable will
    not duplicate the data. We can duplicate an object or array in one of three ways—with
    a third-party library, by traversing the object tree, or by using JSON operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third-party libraries exist to create deep copies of objects. This is generally
    the simplest approach to copying objects. We can also traverse the object's tree
    and copy every value and property into a new object. This will generally require
    us to write and test our own function. Finally, we can use the JSON operations
    stringify and parse to duplicate an object. This is done by first stringifying
    an object, then parsing the string (`JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( obj ) )`). JSON
    operations are usually the simplest approach to duplicating objects, but they
    come with the most drawbacks and limitations. If the object has non-JSON-compatible
    properties, such as functions or classes, this approach will not work. It is also
    very inefficient to convert the entire object into a string and then parse that
    entire string into an object. For small objects, this may not affect performance,
    but if you must copy a large object, it is not recommended that you use this method
    because it is a blocking operation.

    network. These external resources are not directly scoped to the block of code

    Consider a program setup where function A calls function B, and function B causes
    a change to the global state. This change to the global state can be prompted
    by either a direct call to function B or by calling function A, which eventually
    calls function B and changes the state. Since a call to function A will still
    result in a global state change, even though the code in function A does not directly
    modify the global state, function A is still considered to have a side effect.

    effect? Yes. Side effects from I/O will be caused and they are unavoidable. The
    solution to this issue is to isolate side-effect code from the rest of the software.
    Any code that has a side effect or relies on modules or operations with side effects
    (database operations and so on) must be isolated from code that does not. This
    is usually done with modules. Most frontend and backend frameworks encourage us
    to separate state management from the rest of our code by using modules. Code

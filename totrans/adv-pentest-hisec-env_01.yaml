  zh: 漏洞评估
- en: Vulnerability assessments are necessary for discovering potential vulnerabilities
    throughout the environment. There are many tools available that automate this
    process so that even an inexperienced security professional or administrator can
    effectively determine the security posture of their environment. Depending on
    scope, additional manual testing may also be required. Full exploitation of systems
    and services is not generally in scope for a normal vulnerability assessment engagement.
    Systems are typically enumerated and evaluated for vulnerabilities, and testing
    can often be done with or without authentication. Most vulnerability management
    and scanning solutions provide actionable reports that detail mitigation strategies
    such as applying missing patches, or correcting insecure system configurations.

  zh: 提示
- en: The risk of accidentally causing an unintentional denial of service or other
    outage is moderately higher when conducting a penetration test than it is when
    conducting vulnerability assessments. To an extent, this can be mitigated by proper
    planning, and a solid understanding of the technologies involved during the testing
    process. Thus, it is important that the penetration tester continually updates
    and refines the necessary skills.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在进行渗透测试时，意外导致无意的服务拒绝或其他故障的风险比进行漏洞评估时要高。在一定程度上，这可以通过适当的规划和对测试过程中涉及的技术的充分理解来减轻。因此，渗透测试人员不断更新和完善必要的技能是很重要的。
- en: Penetration testing allows the business to understand if the mitigation strategies
    employed are actually working as expected; it essentially takes the guesswork
    out of the equation. The penetration tester will be expected to emulate the actions
    that an attacker would attempt and will be challenged with proving that they were
    able to compromise the critical systems targeted. The most successful penetration
    tests result in the penetration tester being able to prove without a doubt that
    the vulnerabilities that are found will lead to a significant loss of revenue
    unless properly addressed. Think of the impact that you would have if you could
    prove to the client that practically anyone in the world has easy access to their
    most confidential information!

  zh: 渗透测试使企业能够了解所采用的缓解策略是否按预期运行；它基本上消除了猜测。渗透测试人员将被要求模拟攻击者可能尝试的行动，并将面临证明他们能够妥协目标关键系统的挑战。最成功的渗透测试结果是渗透测试人员能够毫无疑问地证明发现的漏洞将导致重大收入损失，除非得到妥善解决。想象一下，如果您能够向客户证明世界上几乎任何人都可以轻松访问他们最机密的信息，您将产生的影响！
- en: Penetration testing requires a higher skill level than is needed for vulnerability
    analysis. This generally means that the price of a penetration test will be much
    higher than that of a vulnerability analysis. If you are unable to penetrate the
    network you will be ensuring your clientele that their systems are secure to the
    best of your knowledge. If you want to be able to sleep soundly at night, I recommend
    that you go above and beyond in verifying the security of your clients.

    The goal should be to prove that sensitive data and systems are protected even

    require hands-on experience to effectively and efficiently execute. At DefCon
    19 Bruce "Grymoire" Barnett provided an excellent presentation on "Deceptive Hacking".
    In this presentation, he discussed how hackers use many of the very same techniques
    used by magicians. It is my belief that this is exactly the tenacity that penetration
    testers must assume as well. Only through dedication, effort, practice, and the
    willingness to explore unknown areas will penetration testers be able to mimic
    the targeted attack types that a malicious hacker would attempt in the wild.

    One is to use the LiveCD ISO to install BackTrack just as you would on a physical

    VMWare image option seen on the BackTrack-Linux.org download site.

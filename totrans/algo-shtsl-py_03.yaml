    all come across some stock they have analyzed, concluded it was doomed to fail,
    and wished they could short it. Then, they watched it crater. They feel confident
    their analytical superpowers would work wonders on the short side as well. It
    all works well in theory until it has to work in practice. When market participants
    come to the world of short selling, they assume they should simply do the opposite
    of what they do on the long side.

    We consider why most traders think they can sell short yet fail in practice. First,
    we will look at why shorting on valuations fails. Then, we will eviscerate the
    structural short tourist trap for good. We will meander in the purgatory of learned
    helplessness, before waking to the reality of short selling. In the second part
    of this chapter, we will start to dive into the world of short selling and its
    unique idiosyncrasies.

    prospects that are temporarily mispriced. They want to buy something that grows
    at a discount, the famous "margin of safety." This approach is known as **Growth
    At a Reasonable Price** (**GARP**). If that seems to work fine on the long side,
    then do the opposite on the short side and voila, right? It could even sound something
    like **Dive at a Record Price** (**DARP**).

    There is always a stock, sometimes an entire industry, that seems to defy the
    conventional laws of gravity. With monetary authorities around the world asleep
    on the "print" button, there is no shortage of absurdly priced stocks. The second
    step is to do some analysis on esoteric business models, sustainability of growth
    rate, cash flow burn rate, and so on. Once the stars align and you spot levitating
    valuations coupled with a sinking business model, it is time to teach manners
    to those insolent stocks with some carefully crafted short positions. Past a certain
    point, no matter how good business models might be, valuations stop making sense
    and things should revert to fair anyway.'

    be the case. The concept of GARP implicitly relies on fairness. Cheap valuations
    revert to fair. The objective is to catch stocks when they are cheap and ride
    the correction up. For technically versed market participants, buy deeply oversold
    stocks and wait for the rebound. It is fair and makes logical sense. It would
    therefore be fair and logical to assume that unsustainable pricing would revert
    down to fair valuation. The problem is that carrying this subconscious belief
    in fairness into the short world proves to be a fatal virtue.

    enough evidence to conclude beyond the shadow of a doubt that they have encountered
    a structural short, institutional long holders have already left the building.
    The only shareholders left are stable long-term investors, such as founders and
    strategic partners. Short selling "structural shorts" becomes a binary event.

    or acquisition happens. In simple terms, share price either drops to zero or stays

    need to sell stock they do not own in the first place. So, they conveniently borrow
    them from stock lending desks, who charge a lending fee. Lending fees are a direct
    function of supply and demand. They go from general collateral 0.25%-0.5% to double-digits
    for hard-to-locate issues. Structural shorts happen to be also referred to as
    crowded shorts, the lending fee for which would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush
    with envy. Share price may go down but borrowing is prohibitively expensive, and
    any bit of buying pressure triggers a vicious short squeeze, where you might find
    that you've made 1-2% over 2 months, only for stock price to rally 15% in 3 days.

    something that doesn't. Even though the absolute movement on each of the shorted
    stocks (C and D) equals the absolute movement of the long positions (A and B),

    puts Ferraris in the garage. While analysts have a natural incentive to maintain
    a favorable rating, they enjoy more freedom with their numbers. They will slash
    their estimates, stretch their investment horizon, and bargain with their upside
    potential. This is the bargaining stage.

    they should probably be aware of their forecast accuracy. Forecasting does not
    seem to be analysts' strong suit either. Marco Dion, then head of quantitative
    research at JP Morgan, compiled a sell-side forecast accuracy report back in 2007
    before the GFC. The object of the paper was to calculate how accurate analysts
    were in their forecasts one year out on a rolling basis.

    on earnings momentum, also referred to as direction over time, as opposed to accuracy.
    What was really fascinating was the in-sample forecast accuracy. Analysts had
    a 2% chance of being spot-on for their earnings forecasts one year out. They had
    a 25% chance of being 10% away. At 2%, being spot-on is called a statistical error.
    At a 25% chance of being 10% away, even if accuracy miraculously doubled, it would
    still have the long-term probability of a coin toss.

    If you are not happy, blame the game, not the players. Analysts are brilliant,
    passionate, hard-working people, with encyclopaedic knowledge of their sectors
    and companies. However, they operate in a game rigged to make people trade, not
    necessarily to make them money.

    first set foot on the short selling terra incognita to the time they subconsciously
    abdicate sovereignty. The most important thing to remember is that the short side
    is *not* the inverse of the long. You cannot rely on mispriced stocks to revert
    to their fair valuations, and "structural shorts" are only profitable in the minds
    of short selling tourists. The short side obeys its own laws.

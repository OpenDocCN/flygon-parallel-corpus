    on absolute versus relative series. Absolute series are the **Open High Low Close**
    (**OHLC**) prices you can see on any website or platform. They often come either
    adjusted for dividends, stock splits, and other corporate actions. Relative series
    are the above absolute series divided by the closing price of the benchmark, adjusted
    for currency.

    do, they attract a lot of attention. Long holders exit the stock while short sellers
    pile on. These stocks become crowded shorts. Popular shorts are notoriously difficult
    to trade—they are illiquid and notoriously volatile. Getting in and out of these
    stocks has some adverse market impact, borrow fees are expensive, and they are
    also prone to short squeezes, those violent rallies at the end of a bearish descent.

    relative strength compared to the market. Prices are restarted versus the benchmark
    at the beginning of the period, but they provide uniform series across sectors.
    At first, it may seem unnatural to enter a short position on a rising stock. Losing
    money does not come naturally to absolute return players. To understand the concept,
    let's reframe it by picturing what happens in a bear market. When the big bear
    pounds the market, nothing goes up. This means that you'll be looking to buy long
    defensive stocks that hold their ground or fall slower than the broader index.
    You will be losing less than the market on the long side. Typically you would
    be buying non-cyclical utilities, railways, or food stocks.
  prefs: []

- en: Conversely, you will be looking to short stocks that drop faster than the benchmark.
    Those tend to be cyclical stocks for which performance ebbs and flows with the
    economic cycle, such as airline companies. By the way, you can keep the darlings
    of the previous bull markets in your portfolio, but remember to switch sides.
    Leaders of bull markets tend to attract late-cycle momentum players. Those are
    the weakest market participants, late to the game, with no real game plan. They
    bail as soon as the going gets tough, which leads to sudden performance disgorgement.
    The relative series open a whole new world of possibilities compared with the
    classic absolute method. Below are 10 reasons that assert the superiority of the

    people consistently manage to time tops and bottoms. They are either amnesiac
    or charlatans, more often a combination of both. When restating everything in
    relative series, the objective is to focus on sector rotation. As we saw in the
    above chart, the number of stocks in either territory does not fluctuate much
    over time. This does not mean the same stocks underperform for eternity. The market
    may go up for years, but it will reward different industries, sectors, and even
    market caps over time. Using the relative weakness method, this means buying nascent
    outperformers and shorting early underperformers. Imagine the impact on clients
    when you tell them after a successful bear campaign it is now time to switch sides

    that go down in absolute value are usually popular. Crowded shorts are volatile
    and illiquid. It is difficult to build large profitable positions.

    that there was a limit to short selling crowded issues. When there is an ample
    supply of ideas on both sides, concentration can be kept low as **Assets Under
    Management** (**AUM**) continue to grow.

    to make things personal. Management of defensive companies understand that their
    stocks are bound to underperform in bull markets. They do not take offense when
    their stocks are either sold short or bought long on this premise. Conversely,
    high-flying tech entrepreneurs know that bear markets are not exactly IPO season.

    management. Everything is rebased in the same currency and benchmark adjusted
    unit. For example, the Japanese market soared as its currency was devalued by
    40%. Managers operating in Japanese yen (JPY) did well in local currency; their
    counterparts denominated in USD fared poorly despite having the exact same stocks
    in their portfolios. The depreciation of the Japanese yen ate all gains away.

    from stock selection to portfolio management must be adjusted for the benchmark
    and fund currency. Decisions such as entry, exit, and position-sizing need to
    be made in currency-adjusted relative prices. Charts in absolute and local currency
    provided by most data vendors answer questions that relative market participants
    should never be asking themselves. Comparing stocks' absolute value with currencies
    is like comparing apples and oranges. Converting the entire investment universe
    into relative series is a bit more involved up front, but a lot easier to manipulate
    thereafter.

    or "they" work their orders. Market participants tend to place stop losses at
    support/resistance levels, round numbers. Some algorithms are specifically designed
    to game resting orders. When all the price levels are calculated relative to the
    index and adjusted for currency, those sniper algorithms are ineffective. The
    series that relative participants react to are different from the absolute levels.

    starts with their competitors and extends to the industry, sector, and broader
    market before tumbling down in absolute value. Entering a short on a relative
    basis may be mildly painful for a while. It will, however, appear prescient to
    those fixated on absolute prices.

    Is there a better selling point to all those investors who are so desperate to
    find one good short seller? There is no better marketing pitch than a chart in
    absolute value plotting the trades you took according to changes relative to the
    index. Imagine anchoring short positions in all the Enrons, Lehmans, GMs, and
    Kodaks of this world long before they even made the news.

    to bear market rallies. This is, however, only half of the equation. Getting out
    on the short side can be messy. Volume thins out as shorts gain in popularity.
    This is where the relative method offers a decisive advantage. At some point,
    selling pressure will be done. Relative short sellers have ample time to cover
    their shorts, while their absolute counterparts double down on their vitriolic
    crusade. Stocks begin to outperform, imperceptibly at first, stubbornly then,
    before rising defiantly. This invariably catches absolute fundamental short sellers
    who bank on a double-dip that never comes.

    to the relative series. Absolute participants are laggard indicators while relative
    players lead the pack. Market participants who adopt the methodology outlined
    in this chapter will have a distinct edge. They will be able to build and liquidate
    positions ahead of the crowd. They will look like prescient investment geniuses.
    They will have more ideas to choose from. Their portfolios will have lower correlation
    to the markets, and lower volatility as well. These are traits investors are looking
    for.

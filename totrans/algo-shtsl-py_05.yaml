    quick decisions as to whom would need surgery, who could survive without, and
    the unfortunate ones for whom nothing could be done. Triage was born out of necessity
    to allocate limited time and resources in the most efficient and humane way possible.
    In the stock market, regime is another word for triage. Some are bullish, some
    are bearish, and some are inconclusive.

- en: Markets tend to "stay wrong" a lot longer than investors tend to stick with
    you. Segregating stocks into different regime buckets—triaging them—before performing
    in-depth analysis is an efficient allocation of resources. The objective of this
    initial triage is not to predict where stocks could, would, or should be headed,
    but to practice the long-lost art of actively listening to what the market has
    to say.
  prefs: []

- en: Some market participants like to spend time and resources on building bear theses
    for stocks that stubbornly defy the gravity of reason. This is not efficient for
    two reasons. First, they expect reversion to the mean. On the long side, they
    trade trends and ride outperformers, expecting them to continue to do well. Meanwhile,
    on the short side, they trade mean reversion and expect expensive stocks to choke
    on humble pie and come back down to cheap prices again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we will analyze in the coming chapters, trend following and mean reversion
    have opposite pay-offs and risk profiles. Long trend-following and short mean-reversion
    does not reduce risk. It compounds it. For now, it suffices to say that market
    participants must make a choice. Either they trade trends expecting them to develop,
    or inefficiencies expecting them to correct. When they choose to trade both trends
    and inefficiencies, their investment style is incongruent. They invite the worst
    outcome of each style, which unsurprisingly tends to happen simultaneously at
    the worst time.

- en: Secondly, expecting stocks to revert is essentially like trying to time the
    top. It is like standing in the middle of the tracks expecting freight train after
    freight train to stop. Bull regimes tend to outlast investors' patience for gallantry.
    It is more prudent to wait for more information to surface and the tide to turn
    bearish before placing a short.

    really help fundamental short-sellers. They often show up too early. They place
    their bets long before the broader market starts to factor in the information.
    The difference between a short selling guru and the dreaded tap on the shoulder
    is 6 months. Short internet stocks in 1999, and you'll be teaching math to bored
    university students in 2000\. Short the same stocks as early as late January 2000,
    and a new short selling star is born.

    The slower line defines the regime while the shorter duration line times entries

    In theory, this combination makes sense. 200 days is a robust long-term measure,
    while 50 days is a good momentum indicator. In practice, this combination has
    an awful hit rate. It only works for big long-term trends. Unfortunately, they
    come few and far between, hence the win rate hovering around 20%. The rest of
    the time the faster moving-average flip-flops back and forth around the slower
    one like a career politician.

    the regime change line. Should the price cross below that level, the regime will
    turn bearish. This happens in the first quarter of 2020, at which time the regime
    turns bearish. The price crosses above that level again and the regime reverts
    to bullish. The price prints an all-time high at the beginning of 2021, tanks,
    then rebounds, but rolls over before the high. The regime turns bearish. It is

    is called a **retest**. In the context of the SPY chart, the market prints a highest
    high from the swing low. The price comes down a little then goes back up but fails
    to take the highest high. The price then penetrates the post-high low. Retests
    are essentially hesitations. They are quite frequent. Markets can and do remain
    indecisive more often than not. However, when retests happen at the end of a sustained
    move, this may signal an exhaustion of the trend and a possible reversal in the

    "highway to hell" in a hand basket. And yet, the regime was not swayed. It probably
    flashed bearishly on the ascent in late May 2020, but promptly reverted back to
    a Robert de Niro "raging bull" market. It is neither good nor bad. It is simply
    how this regime method works. The vast majority of market participants are long-term

    often add to their positions as markets tank, something known as **buy on weakness**.
    This is the perfect regime definition method to accomplish this. The unparalleled
    stability of this regime detection methodology sets the long-term background context.
    The regime is either bullish or bearish. Then, market participants can superimpose
    all kinds of strategies to either "buy on weakness" or "sell on strength" depending
    on the dominant regime.

    to build strategies. There is tremendous value in knowing that the market is still
    bullish and dips should be bought. No other method out there provides this level
    of stability. Institutional investors move big tickets. Getting in and out erodes
    profitability. This is why they will privilege from stability over accuracy. When
    conditions change, they change their mind. Until then, this is usual drama. Market
    participants can then articulate strategies however they see fit. It could be
    swing detection, moving averages, range breakout, or risk reversal. The only thing
    that matters is the knowledge that the market is still in bullish territory.

    First, stability brings reliability. For example, the regime for the S&P 500 switched
    from bull to sideways-bearish only twice in the ten plus years following the 2008
    crisis. Each time, the regime reverted to bullish less than 3 months thereafter.

- en: Novice traders like to protect their profits, so they set tight stop losses.
    The tighter the stop loss, the smaller the distance to the stop loss, therefore
    a bigger position size can be afforded for the same risk budget. This results
    in a large average position size and a low average loss, but a high loss rate.
    Tight stop losses tend to be easily triggered. This also increases trading frequency.
    Failure comes from the accumulation of small losses. For example, if it takes
    three trials to get it right, then the price has to move three times the distance
    to the stop loss just to maintain a positive **gain expectancy** (**GE**).

    makes a new high, then the market has obviously decided to move back into bull
    territory. This is congruent with case 1\. Secondly, the trailing stop loss protects
    the position when it is most vulnerable. Every favorable price move reduces risk.
    When it does not work, a big portion of the risk is crystallized into a small
    loss close to break-even. It does not develop into a full-blown loss as in case
    1\. Thirdly, when sizing the position against the ceiling, you have effectively
    taken a small exploratory position. You have put a chip on the table, but you
    are not ready to call the market''s bluff just yet. If it correctly detects a
    trend, the initial position can be topped up. If not, losses will be contained.

    Partial Exit Only line. It follows the win rate in a linear fashion. The probability
    of success drops below 50% as the price moves beyond 2R. GE of the sole partial
    exit mechanically turns negative. Note that this partial exit is there solely

    robust GE. 1.5R has a higher return potential but a lower residual GE. 2R and

    run risk free. A high-probability early partial exit brings the mode, the peak
    number of trades, to the profit side. With a win rate above 50%, the position
    size could even be supersized using a formula like a **fractional Kelly**, or
    Ralph Vince's **Optimal F**. Optimal F is another powerful position sizing algorithm
    that takes into account the largest drawdown. This warrants big position sizes.

- en: 'Borrow utilization must be below 50%: Borrow utilization is defined as the
    shares available for borrowing divided by shares already borrowed. It is the simplest
    canary in the coalmine and most robust expression of supply and demand. As long
    holders liquidate, the supply of shares available for borrowing dries up. Meanwhile,
    as short sellers pile in, demand increases. Short sellers make money by riding
    the tail of long sellers. When borrow utilization rises above 50%, it means that
    long holders have left the building and that the only players left are tourists.
    Adding another tranche as a trade gets crowded is asking for trouble. Instead
    of riding the tail of long sellers, you will be trapped in a petri dish of short
    sellers. On the long side, fresh buyers bid the price up. On the short side, the
    supply of new short sellers is limited by the availability of borrow. They therefore
    do not have the ability to push prices down, but they add to the selling pressure,
    making stocks prone to short squeezes.'

    exit mechanically turns negative. Note that this partial exit is there solely

    The remainder is closed. A partial exit significantly improves GE. The 1.1R is
    the most conservative. It has the lowest return potential, but it has a built-in
    robust GE. 1.5R has a higher return potential but a lower residual GE. 2R and

    number of trades, to the profit side. With a win rate above 50%, the position
    size could even be supersized using a formula like a **fractional Kelly**, or
    Ralph Vince's **Optimal F**. Optimal F is another powerful position sizing algorithm
    that takes into account the largest drawdown. This warrants big position sizes.

    The floor and ceiling method is an objective way to define when a trend has ended.
    Exit all your short positions when a new floor is printed. Remember that you will
    give back some performance. With this method, you are not trying to time the top,
    but you are paying for confirmation that a trend has ended.

    of a position. If markets start to perform desirably again, you will want to get
    back in. The conditions imposed for the initial entry are unlikely to be met again.
    For example, if you shorted an expensive **Price to Book** (**PBR**) of 2, current
    valuations might have come down to just about fair by now. Consequently, you would
    not enter the trade. You therefore need something simple and robust enough to
    get back in.

    because the price printed a floor, but then subsequently made a ceiling, then
    get in. Set your stop loss at the ceiling level, verify that borrowing is still
    reasonably priced, and off you go. The big takeaway about shorts is that their
    descent is not always linear. Stocks drop from overpriced to fair valuations.
    They sometimes lure long participants, only to resume their descent into the short
    selling heaven of value traps. Give yourself the flexibility to re-enter.

- en: Mean reversion market participants are naturally gifted at short selling. They
    short on a high and cover at a low. They are also better equipped to deal with
    sideways markets. The main danger however is to ignore the regime. While it is
    tempting to short rich valuations, or overbought RSI, stocks on an uptrend will
    often continue on their ascending trajectory. For example, RSI will travel from
    40 to 80 on bullish stocks, and 60 to 20 on bearish ones. Overbought and oversold
    conditions are usually signs of continuation.

- en: The solution is to wait for the regime to rotate from bullish to sideways or
    bearish to start shorting. Incorporate regime definition methods such as Floor/Ceiling
    or moving average crossover in the analysis to reduce false positives.

    losses. Mean reversion market participants do not like stop losses. They are sometimes
    triggered before stocks start to behave as expected. The win rate drops, average
    loss rises, expectancy tanks. One approach is to have wider stop losses. They
    will warrant smaller positions but they will also prevent devastating losses.'

- en: Mean reversion market participants are often tempted to add to losing positions
    on the premise that they will eventually revert. For example, if a stock was expected
    to revert at 2.5 standard deviations from the mean, at 4 standard deviations,
    it would even be more attractive. This may work most of the time, but when it
    does not, losses can be devastating. LTCM tried that. Martingale works until it
    does not.

- en: A statistically more robust yet counterintuitive approach is to reduce size
    when market participants would feel like adding. Assume that past a certain point,
    inefficiencies will not correct but persist. If instead of adding to a loser at
    4 standard deviations, the position was reduced, then either it would revert and
    offset the losses or it would detract less thereafter. Either way, it would tilt
    the skew of losses toward breaking even.

    to losing positions is the deterioration of GE. Adding to a loser directly increases
    the loss rate and average loss. It generally works until it breaks.

    amount you need to close for the trade to break even. When in doubt, close between
    two thirds and three quarters of the positions. The high win rate coupled with
    above 50% profit taking keeps the money-making engine humming.

    a different exit mechanism. Here are two methods:'

    a mean. It is therefore unnecessarily conservative and somewhat illogical to close
    a position at the mean. Wait for the price to overshoot in the other direction
    before closing a position. This overshoot does not have to be symmetrical. For
    example, a 2.5 standard deviation move might warrant an entry, but full exit might
    occur somewhere between 1 and 1.5 standard deviations. When valuations drop, they
    often do not stop at the market average. They overshoot on the downside before
    stabilizing. This method is more congruent with the mindset of mean reversion
    market participants. Inefficiencies exist on both sides.'

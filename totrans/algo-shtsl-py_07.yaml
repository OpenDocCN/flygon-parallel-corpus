    Williams in *Good Morning, Vietnam*. At some point, one colleague walked up to

    consecutive stop loss, I had become immune and could have stomached the next hundred
    without breaking a sweat. Try and see for yourself. Start small. Reward yourself
    immediately after executing a stop loss. After a few rounds, you may notice that
    your brain has started to crave stop losses. That primitive part of your brain

    she had forgotten her scarf and returned to the establishment. However, while
    the waiter could effortlessly memorize all outstanding orders, he did not recall
    seeing her half an hour ago. This led her to a momentous discovery of how our
    brain deals with incomplete tasks. Unfinished business (in this case, a pending

    Tight stop losses tend to be easily triggered. This also increases trading frequency.

    Market participants subject to **First In, First Out** (**FIFO**) rules are understandably
    reluctant to let go of old positions. Another way to deal with stale positions
    is to use options strategies over the underlying cash positions. Bear in mind
    that over time you will be wrong more often than right, so dealing with today's
    losses will make tomorrow's profits look a lot bigger. Winners take care of themselves.

    have realized some profit, reduced your risk, and are guaranteed to break even

    arc line labeled GE All-Out. GE follows an arc. Big moves are rare, and eventually
    fail to compensate for losses. In this case, break even stands at a 16% win rate
    with a 5.4R risk/reward ratio.

- en: Next, let's calculate GE for the fraction of the trade closed. This is the GE
    Partial Exit Only line. It follows the win rate in a linear fashion. The probability
    of success drops below 50% as the price moves beyond 2R. GE of the sole partial
    exit mechanically turns negative. Note that this partial exit is there solely
    as a visual reference as the remainder is indefinitely open. Trend-following strategies
    generally have a default negative GE. Big moves are rare. Loss control is really
    the only way to ensure long-term GE remains positive.

    target prices at 1.1R, 1.5R, 2R, and 3R. We close 91%, 67%, 50%, and 33%, respectively.
    The remainder is closed. A partial exit significantly improves GE. The 1.1R is
    the most conservative. It has the lowest return potential, but it has a built-in
    robust GE. 1.5R has a higher return potential but a lower residual GE. 2R and
    3R have terminal negative GE in this example. Past a certain point, the remainder
    is akin to a lottery ticket.

    better mental state to weather a bear market rally. In practice, you will probably

    conditions. As such, they have a limited shelf life. Once risk is reduced, keeping
    a trailing stop loss on might trigger a premature exit. The objective of a trailing
    stop loss is only to tilt the P&L distribution closer to break even. Now that
    the remainder runs risk free, you might want to deactivate the trailing stop and
    rely on your fixed stop loss. Volatility is high on the short side. Give some

    capacity: how many assets a manager can take on before returns start to dwindle.
    Investors know that the strongest returns happen in the earlier years, when funds
    are small and managers hungry. Yet, they want to see some track record before
    pulling the trigger. So, they wait and see as much as possible, but not too much
    to make sure they will still enjoy some decent returns. More than a mathematical
    approximation, a real-life acid test is inertia. When managers start to pass up
    trades because of market impact, they have reached their saturation point. As
    my mentor June-Yon Kim always said: "capacity sets in when inertia creeps in."
    If you find yourself passing up signals because of inertia, and this seems like
    the right thing to do, either you are lazy, or your asset size is too big. Either

    The only variable that remains unaffected is average win, something which no-one

    the most favorable outcome is break even. This means that any outcome before that

    as Warren Buffett said: "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." Subsequently,
    their judgement will always be colored by the initial cost. If a stock looked
    cheap when they first bought at $10, it must be a bargain at $9\. Market participants
    assume that their analysis is right and the market temporarily wrong. Adding another

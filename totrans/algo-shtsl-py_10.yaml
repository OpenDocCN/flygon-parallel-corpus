    without significant market impact, you do not own anything. It owns you. The way
    to approach liquidity on the short side is radically different. On the long side,

- en: On the short side, when investors liquidate their positions, it is a one-way
    street. After a beating, they don't come back for round two. Nothing captures
    the emotional journey of long market participants more faithfully than the Kübler-Ross
    model. Market participants grieve their losses. Each phase even has a distinctive
    signature on the markets. Interest wanes, and as the pool of market participants
    shrinks, so does liquidity. Early bear markets are a lot more liquid than later-stage
    ones. Short sellers exit into thinner liquidity than they entered.

- en: This limits the investment universe to issues where liquidity is not a problem.
    The resolution of the 2008 great financial crisis got the markets addicted to
    quantitative easing, otherwise known as free money. In layman's terms, monetary
    authorities flooded the world with painkillers to ease the pain of an economic
    crisis. As soon as monetary authorities hint at tapering off, markets spiral down
    in withdrawal, and traders flock to safer, more defensive stocks, which is known
    as "risk-off." This forces monetary cavalry to keep pumping more painkillers into
    the system, which sends all kinds of speculative assets deep into bubble territory.
    When risk is 'on' and traders are looking for riskier stocks with more profit
    potential, small-mid caps are where the action is happening. Meanwhile, on the
    short side, boring blue chips are out of style. Whenever there is no accountability
    for failure, there is no incentive to play safe. When risk is 'off', and market
    participants are investing more defensively, they gravitate toward larger capitalizations,
    where liquidity remains abundant. Reverting the long-small/short-large caps trade
    is not easy. Shorting small caps is a bloody sport. Liquidity evaporates, and
    you can dock a supertanker in the bid/ask spread. So, gains can be wiped out at
    the first squeeze.

    named "**squeeze box**." The mechanics might have been counterintuitive, but it
    had a surreal accuracy rate to predict potential short squeezes. All it took was
    a long-only manager to take a minuscule speculative long position. Since the buy/sell
    equilibrium was already out of balance, this would push the price up and flush
    the tourists out. They would frantically cover, which would rapidly morph into
    a short squeeze. At this point, the long-only manager would leisurely exit their
    long position with a comfortable profit. When I realised that this program directly
    hurt my friends back in the hedge fund world, this WMSD was permanently dismantled.

    are liquidating and ride their tails. Good short stories usually make up for bad

    the numerator and supply on the denominator is what makes borrow utilization the

    These range from **general collateral** (**GC**) on easy-to-borrow issues to prohibitive
    rates on hard-to-borrow or crowded shorts. As borrow gradually gets taken out,
    the quality of the remaining pool deteriorates. Adding to this, hard-to-borrow
    issues do not only fetch usury rates that would make Shakespeare's Shylock blush;
    they are sometimes callable. This means the lenders have the option of withdrawing
    their lending back on short notice. This is referred to as "**recall**." When
    recalls happen, short sellers are left to either locate borrow elsewhere or close
    their positions. Recalls sometimes cause short squeezes.

- en: 'First, the duration of drawdowns: Never test the patience of investors. One
    of the questions lingering on the back of the mind of every investor from retailer
    to institutional asset allocator is: "Is it too late to invest?" Only when greed,
    or the fear of missing out, is stronger than the fear of losing money will they
    put their hard-earned savings to work. In practice, peak inflows often coincide
    with the top of bull runs. Patsies who subscribed to the "Dow at 36,000" charlatanism
    and took the plunge in August 2000 had to endure 80 consecutive months of drawdown
    before they could make their money back in May 2007\. That was just in time for
    the next dive. In contrast, Mr. Madoff was always open for business. He had only
    2 consecutive down months. Every month was a good month to get in. Such a small
    drawdown duration is statistically improbable. The only market participant who
    has ever come close is the legendary Edward Thorp, who ironically blew the whistle
    on Madoff 14 years before the scandal erupted.'

  zh: 首先，回撤的持续时间：永远不要考验投资者的耐心。从零售投资者到机构资产配置者，每个投资者心中都有一个悬而未决的问题：“现在投资是否太晚了？”只有当贪婪或错失机会的恐惧大于损失金钱的恐惧时，他们才会将辛苦赚来的积蓄投入使用。实际上，高峰流入往往与牛市的顶峰重合。在2000年8月，那些订阅了“道指达到36000点”的骗术并在此时入市的傻瓜们不得不忍受80个连续月的回撤，直到2007年5月才能收回他们的钱。这正好是下一次暴跌的时候。相比之下，马多夫先生总是开放的。他只有2个连续的下跌月。每个月都是一个好月份。这样短的回撤持续时间在统计上是不太可能的。唯一接近的市场参与者是传奇人物爱德华·索普，讽刺的是他在丑闻爆发前14年就揭露了马多夫。
- en: 'Second, the magnitude of drawdowns: Never test the stomach of investors. Once
    in a drawdown, investors worry about how bad this could get. The markets might
    go up by 7% long-term average return, conveniently omitting the abysmal -40-50%
    drawdowns in between. Even though positive returns were not spectacular, the maximum
    drawdown of -1.56% made it look like a risk-free investment. Kahneman-Tversky
    formulated their prospect theory in a much more brilliant way: loss aversion is
    more powerful than profit-seeking. It illustrates a powerful concept: "It does
    not matter how much you make, as long as you don''t lose." Investors could set
    and forget.'

- en: 'Third is the frequency of drawdowns: Never test the nerves of investors. Madoff
    was supposedly up 92% of the time as opposed to 63% for the S&P. S&P had 6 years
    of annual returns above 20%. It also had 4 years of negative double-digit returns.

  zh: 第四是半相关性（与标普指数下跌月的相关性），或者在下行市场中赚钱的能力。据称，马多夫在标普指数下跌时涨幅为3%。这一点敲定了交易。在其他人都在下跌时仍然站稳的经理脱颖而出。他们的电话响个不停，有兴趣的投资者络绎不绝。

    However, the closer you get, the more attractive your proposition becomes. If
    you manage to build a product somewhere between Madoff's Holy Grail and a passive
    investment in the index, you will get a serious edge over your competitors.

  zh: 摘要
- en: This short chapter is not meant to test the braincells of the reader. It is
    simply a collection of practical tips on how to avoid classic expensive pitfalls
    and meet investors' expectations. Investors do not buy into long/short products
    for long ideas. They want low-volatility uncorrelated returns. This chapter considered
    investors' expectations, while avoiding the trap of thinking of the short book
    as an afterthought of the more fun long book. If those problem stocks are removed
    from your field of vision, they will not be on your mind and this will eliminate
    temptation.

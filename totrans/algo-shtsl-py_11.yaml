    in the markets. The more confident they are, the more they tend to increase leverage
    to capture opportunities. Nothing looks more like a kid in a candy store than
    a growth manager in a tech bubble. Conversely, market participants tend to reduce
    their gross and increase their cash exposures to protect capital in periods of
    turbulence or uncertainty. Strategically managing gross exposure can be a powerful
    tool to boost performance in good times and protect capital in rough markets.

    they stick to a fixed level of exposure, or they take an unstructured approach.
    Fixed exposure participants stick to the same level of gross exposure throughout
    the cycle. The rationale for a constant level of gross exposure is simplicity.
    Participants like to keep the number of names to a level they can safely manage.
    They may leave money on the table in good times, yet they keep drawdowns to a
    manageable level during losing streaks. On the other hand, unstructured participants
    get bulled up in good times, load up the truck, and hoard cash in bad times.

    long side drop faster and farther than low beta stocks, for instance. The point
    is to assume that "correlation goes to 1," meaning everything drops like a stone
    across the board. Long and short portfolio heats do not cancel one another. In
    theory, one would assume that the short side compensates the drop on the long
    side. In practice, shorts sometimes outperform longs during market pullbacks.
    Panicked momentum buyers dump their long holdings, thereby precipitating prices

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The maximum heat band should be defined as follows. The goal is not to reduce
    gross exposure across the board. The objective is to reduce the open risk at the
    position level, which will result in a contraction of the gross exposure. Stocks
    have different volatility signatures. Low-volatility stocks warrant bigger positions.
    For example, cutting the risk on defensive stocks has a vastly different impact
    on gross exposure than on highly volatile stocks. This system is more effective
    than actual gross exposure bands. One thing market participants should bear in
    mind is the upper bound of the portfolio heat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a rational maximum risk number that ensures an optimal geometric growth
    rate of the equity curve. Excellent, yet it is completely irrelevant. What matters
    is how much risk your clientele can stomach. For example, if clients say they
    can live with a 10% drawdown, then your acceptable maximum portfolio heat should
    be around 5%. Humans in general, and clients in particular, vastly overestimate
    their tolerance for pain. Besides, it will take time and effort to redress the
    situation. The upper bound is literally a business decision. Volatility is a by-product
    of risk—the more risk you tolerate at the portfolio level, the more volatility
    you invite in the portfolio. This will in turn limit the type of clientele you
    will be able to target. Pension funds are volatility-adverse, for instance. It
    will define everything from the number of names to the performance and information
    ratio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When in doubt, err on the side of caution. A classic solution is to increase
    the number of names, for instance. Furthermore, as we will see in the *Tactical
    deployment* section, investors think in calendar years. Consequently, your upper
    tolerance varies according to whether it's closer to the beginning or end of the
    year. All things being equal, risk should start small, progressively increase,
    peak in the third quarter, and wind down by the end of the calendar year. Keep
    surprises for Christmas presents, not your investors' money.

    their ability to protect capital. Your system must be able to trade its way out
    of a drawdown. A simple rule of thumb is to set the minimum at half the maximum.

    5% and your minimum at 2.5%.

    exposure may look a lot more dramatic. A +/-0.1% difference in portfolio heat

    on volatility, performance, and liquidity as in market impact. In practice, there
    is some magic in this skill. Investors will pick up on disciplined risk management,

    annual time segments. If investors think in calendar years, then so should you.
    Leverage should therefore be strategically deployed throughout the year. If you
    start the year all leveraged up, and performance tanks right out of the gate,
    you will spend the rest of the year trading yourself out of a hole, with investors
    breathing down your neck. Stress is bad for good decision-making. On the other
    hand, once you build performance, it will give a cushion to play with leverage.
    So, start every year at the minimum leverage. The year may start off slowly. Investors
    will forget a slow start, but they will not forgive a rough one.

    we will revisit the convex oscillator for the positions already in the portfolio.
    The relationship at the micro level (risk per trade) before entry remains true
    at the portfolio macro level (portfolio heat). The market is constantly moving,
    so risk should be adjusted accordingly. Risk per trade oscillates within a maximum
    and minimum band at the stock level. Similarly, portfolio heat oscillates from
    a maximum and minimum. The beauty of this approach lies in its elegant simplicity.
    We do not concentrate on the size of positions, only on their open risk. This
    rapidly reduces leverage, while leaving successful risk-free positions unaffected.'

    take a classic case. Someone up there in the rarefied atmosphere of management
    hits pause on a Solitaire game and decides to reduce exposure across the board.
    In execution trader English, this means cutting leverage. There is no cookie-cutter
    formula to shave position size across a portfolio. There are several methods available
    to market participants. They range from axing all positions across the board to
    surgically excising marginal risk out of the most vulnerable positions. Since

    is to reduce the size, starting by using relative risk (`rRisk`) as a sorting
    key: `port_long[''rRisk''] / (port_long[''rRisk''].sum()`. The higher the risk,
    the bigger the reduction, and so on.'

    few short bets. Concentration increases volatility. Another technique to reduce
    net exposure is to sell futures, which have lower beta than single stocks. Both
    techniques have a material impact on correlation and volatility. But, net exposure
    is to portfolio management what price-to-earnings ratio is to valuations. It is
    a good enough shortcut, but it should not be the sole basis for a decision. It
    is better to contextualize net exposure along with other variables. It is therefore

    cap, exchange, and liquidity sides. With small caps at 1.7 and beyond on the long

    to the markets. If the market returns $1, a beta of 1.5 would return $1.5\. In
    mathematical terms, this is the slope of the return of a stock versus the benchmark.
    Net beta is the difference between the beta adjusted long and short exposures
    expressed as a decimal value. It goes past the net exposure headline to reflect
    a portfolio's underlying directional sensitivity. When risk is on and Mr. Market
    is in a good mood, high beta stocks tend to do well. The market rewards risk takers
    who go for riskier issues. Liquidity is the primary risk of any market. As a result,
    small caps have higher beta than large caps. High beta stocks are also industries
    where there are significant failure risks such as tech or biotech, or balance
    sheet risks such as financials. Critics of the hedge fund industry often describe
    hedge funds as beta merchants, or beta disguised as alpha. Critics are right.

    +0.5\. Headline net exposure may appear low, but residual sensitivity to the markets
    can be elevated. In a bear market, the long book would be constituted of defensive
    issues such as foods and utilities with a beta traditionally below 1\. The short
    book would list all the leaders of the previous bull phase disgorging their euphoria.
    This would result in a positive net exposure of somewhere between +5 to +20% and
    a negative net beta of -0.1 to -0.5\. Bearish portfolios have defensive stocks
    on the long side and market-sensitive stocks on the short side.

    more names on the short than the long side, or net negative concentration. Portfolios
    often have more names on the long side than the short. When confronted with the
    scarcity of ideas on the short side, market participants resort to oversizing
    their short bets to bring net exposure down. They end up rationalizing these decisions
    by calling their outsized positions "high-conviction shorts," "structural shorts,"
    or "tactical shorts."

    side is notoriously volatile, this results in the short book driving the volatility
    of the overall portfolio. Now, investors want low volatility. The only way to
    lower volatility is to reduce the concentration on the short side. This means
    smaller bets and more diversified names. As we saw in *Chapter 5*, *Regime Definition*,
    this is feasible in a relative long/short portfolio but much harder to accomplish
    in an absolute long/short. The short book needs to have structurally more names
    than the long side to compensate for the volatility.

    bought a $2 million stake in a moribund penny stock at $12 named AAPL. However,
    on the short side, successful trades shrink. Even if a stock went down 10%, a
    -0.50% initial bet would only return +0.05%. Add transaction costs and slippage
    and there is barely enough money left for coffee and croissants. On the short
    side, keep powder until the fat pitch shows up. Market participants are all too
    often scared to sell short. They respond by taking positions too small to hurt
    but also too tiny to contribute. So, work on your risk management first, then

    We trade our emotions. This manifests both in over/under trading as well as position
    sizing. Euphoric traders overtrade and oversize their positions. Traders in a
    slump pass up "free money" trades and bet too timidly. You must strive to trade
    like a psychopath, with as little emotional interference as possible.

    from downtrodden (-3), the holy space of equanimity for every trade upon entry

    a few entries, there will be a baseline. This is a fun game I discovered reading
    Dr Van Tharp. I personally found boredom to be positively correlated with adherence

    sports car. Without proper training, people tend to take their shiny new toy for
    an off-road spin. In this chapter, we looked at the major levers to engineer the
    returns you need to attract the clientele you want. Those are gross exposure or
    leverage, portfolio heat or open risk, net exposure or directionality, net beta
    or residual sensitivity to the market, and concentration or the net number of
    names in the portfolio. Those variables give access to volatility, performance,
    correlation, and liquidity as in market impact.

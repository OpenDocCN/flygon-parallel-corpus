    Management System** (**PMS**) for a start-up hedge fund with less than $5 million
    under management. The principals believed that risk management was not some ornament
    of the business, but the business itself. Fast forward to now, and they are the
    dominant player in the Japanese alternative space. In this chapter, we will continue
    with our work from the last two chapters, and introduce a customized PMS which
    shows risk visualization across the portfolio.

    we explored throughout this book. In *Chapter 1*, *The Stock Market Game*, we
    set the context that the market is an infinite, complex random game. In *Chapter
    6*, *The Trading Edge is a Number, and Here is the Formula*, we unveiled the magical,
    mysterious, and mythical trading edge formula. In *Chapter 8*, *Position Sizing:
    Money is Made in the Money Management Module*, we demonstrated that position sizing
    determines performance. And we learned in *Chapter 11*, *The Long/Short Toolbox*,
    about the tools in our toolbox. So, we know that position sizing is the key determinant,
    but we don''t know which positions will work out, yet we must maintain a positive
    expectancy while managing exposures. Rinse and repeat every day for years to attract
    and keep investors.'

    fruit. In 2005, I joined a hedge fund whose PMS was so ugly, looking at it could
    have caused brain damage. I promptly tooled it up, at least to get rid of the
    health hazard. Suddenly, problem children lit up like garlands on a Christmas
    tree. Volatile penny stocks on the short side, lazy dogs, and unappreciated racing
    hounds were all swiftly dealt with. Volatility came down. Performance was more
    consistent. The Sharpe ratio jumped. Investors noticed. **Assets Under Management**

    unfortunately no free sources for borrow utilization. As a shortcut, when the
    lending fee is largely above the average, assume popularity. The simplest way

    make simple rules, like (for example) cut exposure in half if utilization rises
    above 40% and by an additional half for every 10% increase. By the time utilization
    reaches 60%, exposure would be 25% of the original size. This is just food for

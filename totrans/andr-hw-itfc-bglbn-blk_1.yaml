    with the BeagleBone Black and create Android apps that interface with external
    hardware that is connected to the BeagleBone Black. You will develop software
    that receives input from the outside world via buttons and sensors, stores and
    retrieves data from external memory chips, and lights external LEDs. Better yet,
    you'll learn how to do this in a flexible way that can be easily integrated into
    your apps.

    that it encompasses many different areas of expertise. Understanding electronic
    circuits and knowing how to interface them with the BeagleBone Black, understanding
    the Linux kernel, and developing Android apps are a few such areas. Luckily, you
    don't have to be an expert in these areas to learn the basics of interfacing hardware
    with Android. We have done our best to guide you through the examples in this
    book without requiring you to have an in-depth knowledge of the Linux kernel or
    electronics theory.

    its introduction to the world in a beta release in 2007, it has grown to become
    the dominant mobile phone OS. Aside from mobile phones, it has also been used
    for tablets (such as the Barnes & Noble Nook eReader and the Tesco Hudl tablet)
    and a variety of other embedded multimedia devices. The OS has added new features
    and evolved over the years, but it still has the same primary design principles
    as it did when it was first conceived. It provides a lightweight OS with a touchscreen
    interface that gives quick and easy access to multimedia applications while using
    minimal resources.

    it an excellent OS for your projects. The source code of Android is open source
    and freely available from [http://source.android.com](http://source.android.com).
    It is free for you to use in any products that you create. Android uses the popular
    Linux kernel, so any expertise that you already have with Linux will aid you in
    your Android development. There is a well-documented interfacing API that makes
    developing for Android simple and straightforward.

    to power and communicate with it. Before you begin any serious software development
    for hardware-interfacing projects with the BBB, there are a few additional pieces
    of hardware that you will need. In our opinion, the best place to purchase these
    items is **AdaFruit** ([www.adafruit.com](http://www.adafruit.com)). Almost everything
    here is available from this single source, and their customer service is very
    good. In fact, many of the items listed here are available as a BeagleBone Black
    starter kit from AdaFruit (product ID 703). The starter kit does not contain a
    3.3 V **Future Technology Devices International (FTDI)** cable, but it does include
    the BeagleBone Black itself.

    one of these cables. The cable is necessary if you wish to observe the boot process
    of the BBB (both bootloader and kernel output as the system is initialized), and
    it also provides a console shell into Linux and Android. This shell helps you
    to troubleshoot boot problems, as you will always have a method of interacting
    with the system when a network connection is unavailable, or when no communication
    services are up and running.

    enough power to run the BBB. If you are using external capes, or are otherwise
    attaching external circuits that draw power from the 5 volt pins of the BBB, you
    must use an external power supply. BeagleBoard.org specifies that the power supply
    must be a 2 amp, 5 volt DC power supply with a 2.1 mm barrel connector that is
    center positive. AdaFruit sells a power supply that conforms to the BBB's requirements

    and quickly construct circuits without the worry of soldering. Because of this,
    we recommend that you invest in a breadboard and some breadboarding jumper wires
    (product ID 153). Your breadboard doesn't have to be anything big or fancy, but
    you should use at least a standard half-size breadboard (product ID 64) for the
    projects given in this book.

    the wires that connect electronic circuits to the BBB. Using Proto Plate makes
    relocating your BBB and breadboard simple and painless.

    card, but most premade Android system images will only consume the first 4–8 GB
    of space on the card. As most laptops and desktop PCs don't directly accept microSD
    cards, you should own at least one microSD-to-SD card adapter. Luckily, one of
    these adapters is typically packaged with each microSD card that you buy.

    components as your interests and budget permit. It can be expensive to purchase

    to the BBB. There are a few different distributions of Android available for the
    BBB, but we selected BBBAndroid because it uses the 3.8 Linux kernel. This kernel
    includes the **Cape Manager** (**capemgr**) functionality as well as a few other
    tools that will assist you in interfacing hardware to Android apps. Other flavors
    of Android on the BBB use the 3.2 Linux kernel, which is much older and lacks
    capemgr support. [Chapter 2](part0019_split_000.html#page "Chapter 2. Interfacing
    with Android"), *Interfacing with Android*, discusses the capemgr functionality
    in more detail. The 3.8 kernel is a good balance between enabling the newer features
    for the BBB while avoiding any potentially unstable, cutting-edge features.

    arbitrary files in the filesystem. The system must be running to access the eMMC

    but the size is approximately 8 GB. The device assigned to this card is `/dev/sdb`.
    Other devices listed by `fdisk` will be secondary storage devices (such as your
    hard drive). Before proceeding any further, make certain that you have identified
    the proper device file that belongs to your microSD card. If you select the wrong
    device, you will destroy the filesystem on that device!

- en: In this chapter, you learned about the hardware that you'll need to develop
    software for the BeagleBone Black, the electronics components and devices that
    you will need for the exercises in this book, and how to install an Android distribution
    onto a microSD card for use on the BBB. In the next chapter, you will learn how
    Android interacts with hardware at the software level and how the BBB can be configured
    to interface with the hardware components that you will be using in this book.

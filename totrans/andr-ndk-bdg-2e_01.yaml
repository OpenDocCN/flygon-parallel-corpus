    We are now able to test the applications we will develop in a representative environment.
    Even better, we can now test them in several conditions and resolutions without
    requiring a costly device. However, if emulators are useful development tools,
    take into account that emulation is not always perfectly representative and lacks
    some features, especially hardware sensors, which can be partially emulated.

    see we set CPU/ABI to Intel Atom (x86), whereas most Android devices run on ARM
    processors. Indeed, since Windows, OS X, and Linux all run on x86, only x86 Android
    emulator images can benefit from hardware and GPU acceleration. On the other hand,
    ARM ABI can run rather slow without it, but it may be more representative of the
    devices your application may run on.

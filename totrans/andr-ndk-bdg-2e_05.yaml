    which is similar to the main methods in desktop applications. It is called only
    once when `NativeActivity` is instantiated and launched. It loops over application
    events until `NativeActivity` is terminated by the user (for example, when pressing
    a device's back button) or until it exits by itself (more about this in the next
    part).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `android_main()` method is not the real native application entry point.
    The real entry point is the `ANativeActivity_onCreate()` method hidden in the
    `android_native_app_glue` module. The event loop we implemented in `android_main()`
    is in fact a delegate event loop, launched in its own native thread by the glue
    module. This design decouples native code from the `NativeActivity` class, which
    is run on the UI thread on the Java side. Thus, even if your code takes a long
    time to handle an event, `NativeActivity` is not blocked and your Android device
    still remains responsive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The delegate native event loop in `android_main()` is itself composed, in our
    example, of two nested while loops. The outer one is an infinite loop, terminated
    only when activity destruction is requested by the system (indicated by the `destroyRequested`
    flag). It executes an inner loop, which processes all pending application events.

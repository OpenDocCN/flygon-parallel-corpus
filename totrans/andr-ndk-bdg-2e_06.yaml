  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenGL ES 1.0 and 1.1 are supported on all Android devices (except 1.1, which
    is supported on a few very old devices). It offers an old school graphic API with
    a **fixed pipeline** (that is, a fixed set of configurable operations to transform
    and render geometry). Specification is not completely implemented, but most features
    are available. This could still be a good choice for simple 2D or 3D graphics
    or to port legacy OpenGL code.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenGL ES 2 is supported on almost all phones nowadays, even older ones, starting
    from API Level 8\. It replaces the fixed pipeline with a modern programmable pipeline
    with **Vertex** and **Fragment Shaders**. It is a bit more complex but also more
    powerful. It is a good choice for the more complex 2D or 3D games, while still
    maintaining a very good compatibility. Note that OpenGL ES 1.X is frequently emulated
    by an OpenGL 2 implementation behind the scenes.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OpenGL ES 3.0 is available on modern devices starting from API Level 18, and
    OpenGL ES 3.1 is available starting from API Level 21 (not all devices at these
    API level may support it though). They bring a set of new improvements to GLES
    2 (**Texture Compression** as a standard feature, **Occlusion Queries, Instanced
    Rendering**, and others for 3.0, **Compute Shaders**, **Indirect Draw** commands,
    and others for 3.1) and a better compatibility with the desktop version of OpenGL.
    It is backward compatible with OpenGL ES 2.

    or setting pixels one by one as seen in the previous chapter, we invoke efficient
    OpenGL ES drawing primitives. Note that the effect appears only the first time

- en: Rendering a scene requires clearing the framebuffer and swapping the display
    buffer. The latter operation is triggered when `eglSwapBuffers()` is invoked.
    Swapping on Android is synchronized with the screen refresh rate to avoid image
    **Tearing**; this is a **VSync**. The refresh rate is variable depending on the
    device. A common value is 60 Hz but some devices have different refresh rates.

    front buffer shown to the user. The front buffer becomes the back buffer and vice
    versa (the pointers are switched). This technique is more commonly referred to
    as **page flipping**. According to the driver implementation, the swapping chain
    can be extended with a third buffer. In this situation, we talk about **Triple

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In main memory (that is, in RAM), we talk about Vertex Arrays (abbreviated VA).
    Vertex arrays are transmitted from the CPU to the GPU for each draw call. As a
    consequence, they are slower to render, but also much easier to update. Thus,
    they are appropriate when a mesh of vertices is changing frequently. This explains
    the decision to use a vertex array to implement sprite batches; each sprite is
    updated each time a new frame is rendered (position, as well as texture coordinates,
    to switch to a new frame).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In driver memory (generally in GPU memory or **VRAM**), we talk about **Vertex
    Buffers Objects**. Vertex buffers are faster to draw but more expensive to update.
    Thus, they are often used to render static data that never changes. You can still
    transform it with vertex shaders, which we are going to see in the next part.
    Note that some hints can be provided to the driver during initialization (`GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW`)
    to allow fast updates but at the price of more complex buffer management (that
    is, multiple buffering).

    of showing a particle effect, where each particle corresponds to a star. OpenGL
    provides such a feature through **Point** **Sprites**. A point sprite is a special

    a whole vertex buffer, many sprites can be drawn at the same time efficiently.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Talking about vertices, you may have noticed that we have not created a vertex
    array but a vertex buffer object. Indeed, point sprites are evaluated completely
    in the vertex shader. This optimization allows us to use a static geometry (`glBufferData()`
    with the hint `GL_STATIC_DRAW`) which can be managed efficiently by the driver.
    Note that vertex buffer objects can also be marked as being subject to updates
    using the hint `GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW` (which means buffer will change frequently) or
    `GL_STREAM_DRAW` (which means buffer will be used once and thrown). The process
    of creating a VBO is similar to the process of creating any other kind of object
    in OpenGL, and involves generating a new identifier, selecting it, and finally
    uploading data in driver memory. If you understand this process, you understand
    the way OpenGL works.

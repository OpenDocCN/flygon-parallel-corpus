    of Android. We will then be able to study the `SoundPool` class and the different
    ways we use it depending on the Android version of the device the app is running
    on. At this point, we can then put everything we have learned into producing a
    cool sound demo app, which will also introduce us to a new UI widget, **Spinner**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the time throughout this book, we haven't paid any attention to supporting
    older Android devices, the main reason being that all the up-to-date parts of
    the API we have been using work on such a high percentage of devices (in excess
    of 99%) that it has not seemed worthwhile. Unless you intend on carving out a
    niche in apps for ancient Android relics, this seems like a sensible approach.
    Regarding playing sounds, however, there have been some relatively recent modifications
    to the Android API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, this isn't immediately a big deal because devices newer than this
    can still use the old parts of the API. But it is good practice to specifically
    handle these differences in compatibility, because eventually, one day, the older
    parts might not work on newer versions of Android.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reason for discussing this here and now is that the slight differences
    in pre- and post-Android Lollipop sound handling give us a good excuse to see
    how we can deal with things like this in our code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will see how we can make our app compatible with the very latest devices
    and pre-Lollipop devices as well.

    let's look at some simple code for detecting the current Android version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Detecting the current Android version
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We can determine the current version of Android using the static variables
    of the `Build.Version` class and we can determine whether it is newer than a specific
    version by comparing it to that version''s appropriate `Build.VERSION_CODES` variable.
    If that explanation was a bit of a mouthful, just look at how we determine whether
    the current version is equal to or newer (greater) than Lollipop:'

- en: The SoundPool class
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `SoundPool` class allows us to hold and manipulate a collection of sound
    effects – literally, a pool of sounds. The class handles everything from decompressing
    a sound file such as a `.wav` or a `.ogg` to keeping an identifying reference
    to it via an integer ID, and, of course, playing the sound. When the sound is
    played, it is done so in a non-blocking manner (using a thread behind the scenes)
    that does not interfere with the smooth running of our app or our users' interaction
    with it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first thing we need to do is add the sound effects to a folder called `assets`
    in the `main` folder of the game project. We will do this for real shortly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Next, in our Java code, declare an object of the `SoundPool` type and an `int`
    to use as an ID for each sound effect we intend to use. We also declare another
    `int` called `nowPlaying`, which we can use to track which sound is currently
    playing, and we will see how we do this shortly:'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Now we will look at the two different ways we initialize a `SoundPool` depending
    upon the version of Android the device is using. This is the perfect opportunity
    to use our method of writing different code for different versions of Android.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Initializing SoundPool the new way
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new way involves us using an `AudioAttributes` object to set the attributes
    of the pool of sound we want.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In the first block of code we use chaining and call four separate methods on
    one object that initialize our `AudioAttributes` object (`audioAttributes`):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the code, we use chaining and the `Builder` method of this class to initialize
    an `AudioAttributes` object to let it know that it will be used for UI interaction
    with `USAGE_ASSISTANCE_SONIFICATION`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also use the `CONTENT_TYPE_SONIFICATION` value, which lets the class know
    it is for responsive sounds, for example, a user button click, a collision, or
    similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we can initialize the `SoundPool` (`sp`) itself by passing in the `AudioAttributes`
    object (`audioAttributes`) and the maximum number of simultaneous sounds we are
    likely to want to play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second block of code chains another four methods to initialize `sp`, including
    a call to `setAudioAttributes` that uses the `audioAttributes` object that we
    initialized in the earlier block of chained methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now we can write an `else` block of code that will, of course, have the code
    for the old way of doing things.

    (`sp`) by passing in the number of simultaneous sounds. The final parameter is
    for sound quality and passing `0` is all we need to do. This is much simpler than
    the new way but also less flexible regarding the choices we can make:'

    documentation says about it.
  prefs: []

    it's a good excuse to look at some simple code to handle different versions of
    Android.

  prefs: []

- en: Loading sound files into memory
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with our thread control, we are required to wrap our code in `try`-`catch`
    blocks. This makes sense because reading a file can fail for reasons beyond our
    control, but also we are forced to because the method that we use throws an exception
    and the code we write will not compile otherwise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside the `try` block, we declare and initialize an object of the `AssetManager`
    and `AssetFileDescriptor` types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `AssetFileDescriptor` instance is initialized by using the `openFd` method
    of the `AssetManager` object, which actually decompresses the sound file. We then
    initialize our ID (`idFX1`) at the same time as we load the contents of `AssetFileDescriptor`
    into our `SoundPool`.

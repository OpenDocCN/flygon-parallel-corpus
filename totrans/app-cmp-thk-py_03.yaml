    it, or what everything meant. However, with the last code, you get a lot of information
    just by running it, which is more helpful than the first two. You can also add

    that we had a mathematical algorithm, T = 12*k*, that gave us the total cost,
    T, of *k* children. Let's add a condition here. If we had a budget of $200, we'd
    want to know if we are over, under, or right on that budget.

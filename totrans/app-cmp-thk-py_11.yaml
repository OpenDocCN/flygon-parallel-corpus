    the input and output necessary to design an algorithm for the problems. We will
    use concepts we learned in [*Chapter 8*](B15413_08_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114),
    *Introduction to Python*, where we discussed object-oriented programming, dictionaries,
    lists, and more. As you practice getting input and using it in your algorithm,
    you'll be able to see that the output of an algorithm is dependent on the input
    information.

    devices that the computer then interprets to provide a result, or **output**.
    As we look at the types of inputs and how we use input in algorithms, you''ll
    see the output we get from those algorithms. Let''s take a look at some examples
    of input devices:'

    to be useable. In Python, we write algorithms that use inputs such as these. **User**
    input is when a program asks the user for information that will then be used to
    produce the output. Keep in mind that input and output can happen at any time
    within the algorithm. We can also provide output feedback that requires additional
    input from the user, and so on. Let's take a look at how we can get user input
    from Python.

    is used to take user input, and then it automatically converts the input into
    the user expected output.

    ask anything; it just gives a blank space and the user has to assume that's where
    you type the input. But that can cause a lot of confusion, since there's nothing
    telling the user whether it needs input or what kind of thing they have to enter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can alleviate some of that confusion by using `print` statements, for example,
    by providing the user with information about what input we'll be asking for. We
    can also include a statement as part of the `input()` function. For example, we
    could use a line of code such as `name = input('What is your name?')`, which would
    show the statement in quotations first so that the user knows what we are asking.
    Either way, providing a statement so that the user knows what is needed is really
    important when we design our algorithms.

    how we get information for the algorithm to respond to. For example, a user can
    provide input to an algorithm that has prompts for that information, as we saw
    in the sample problems. Python and other programming languages can also get input
    from a mouse, scanners, cameras, and other devices that the program interacts
    with.

    need, when we need them in the design, and what we need as output from the program.
    In [*Chapter 3*](B15413_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056), *Understanding
    Algorithms and Algorithmic Thinking*, we used user input to find the cost of lunches.
    We had created a dictionary to help us find that information. Similarly, after
    reading this chapter, you now have the skills required to build algorithms to
    solve some additional problems, such as our digit guessing game and our maximum
    finder.

- en: 'Whether you''re just getting started with programming, or you''ve settled on
    Qt as the GUI toolkit for your project, Qt Creator is a great choice for an Integrated
    Development Environment (IDE)! In this book, we work to help you make the most
    of Qt Creator, showing you almost every facet of using Qt Creator, from its configuration
    through compiling and debugging applications, along with numerous tips and tricks.
    Along the way, you gain valuable experience not just with Qt Creator as an IDE,
    but with Qt and Qt Quick as well. After reading this book, you''ll be able to:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Qt and Qt Creator are cross-platform tools. Whether you're using a Windows machine,
    a Macintosh using Mac OS X, or a workstation running Linux, you probably have
    what you need. You should have a reasonable amount of disk space (around 10 gigabytes
    is plenty) to install the whole Qt Creator IDE and Qt libraries, and as with any
    software development environment, the more RAM you have, the better (although
    I've run Qt Creator on netbooks running Ubuntu with a gigabyte of RAM and survived!).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should have a basic understanding of computer programming, and should be
    prepared to write code in C++. Basic knowledge of JavaScript is helpful if you're
    interested in programming with Qt Quick, but you can pick that up along the way
    with little difficulty.

- en: I wrote this book for those who have little or no experience with Qt and Qt
    Creator, who may be using it for the first time as part of a college class, an
    open source project, or who just want to experiment with the platform and IDE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I especially want to encourage you to read this book if you're a student using
    Qt Creator in your university class on C++ programming! You should focus on the
    first two chapters, and as much of the rest as you need for your course.

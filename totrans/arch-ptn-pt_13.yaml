    the inputs to our system, and we turned our application into a message-processing
    machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To achieve that, we converted all our use-case functions to event handlers.
    When the API receives a POST to create a new batch, it builds a new `BatchCreated`
    event and handles it as if it were an internal event. This might feel counterintuitive.
    After all, the batch *hasn’t* been created yet; that’s why we called the API.
    We’re going to fix that conceptual wart by introducing commands and showing how
    they can be handled by the same message bus but with slightly different rules.

- en: Like events, *commands* are a type of message—instructions sent by one part
    of a system to another. We usually represent commands with dumb data structures
    and can handle them in much the same way as events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The differences between commands and events, though, are important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Commands are sent by one actor to another specific actor with the expectation
    that a particular thing will happen as a result. When we post a form to an API
    handler, we are sending a command. We name commands with imperative mood verb
    phrases like “allocate stock” or “delay shipment.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Commands capture *intent*. They express our wish for the system to do something.
    As a result, when they fail, the sender needs to receive error information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Events* are broadcast by an actor to all interested listeners. When we publish
    `BatchQuantityChanged`, we don’t know who’s going to pick it up. We name events

  prefs: []

    know who’s handling an event, senders should not care whether the receivers succeeded
    or failed. [Table 10-1](#events_vs_commands_table) recaps the differences.

- en: Many developers get uncomfortable at this point and ask, “What happens when
    an event fails to process? How am I supposed to make sure the system is in a consistent
    state?” If we manage to process half of the events during `messagebus.handle`
    before an out-of-memory error kills our process, how do we mitigate problems caused
    by the lost messages?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let’s start with the worst case: we fail to handle an event, and the system
    is left in an inconsistent state. What kind of error would cause this? Often in
    our systems we can end up in an inconsistent state when only half an operation
    is completed.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, we could allocate three units of `DESIRABLE_BEANBAG` to a customer’s
    order but somehow fail to reduce the amount of remaining stock. This would cause
    an inconsistent state: the three units of stock are both allocated *and* available,
    depending on how you look at it. Later, we might allocate those same beanbags
    to another customer, causing a headache for customer support.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our allocation service, though, we’ve already taken steps to prevent that
    happening. We’ve carefully identified *aggregates* that act as consistency boundaries,
    and we’ve introduced a *UoW* that manages the atomic success or failure of an
    update to an aggregate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, when we allocate stock to an order, our consistency boundary is
    the `Product` aggregate. This means that we can’t accidentally overallocate: either
    a particular order line is allocated to the product, or it is not—there’s no room
    for inconsistent states.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By definition, we don’t require two aggregates to be immediately consistent,
    so if we fail to process an event and update only a single aggregate, our system
    can still be made eventually consistent. We shouldn’t violate any constraints
    of the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this example in mind, we can better understand the reason for splitting
    messages into commands and events. When a user wants to make the system do something,
    we represent their request as a *command*. That command should modify a single
    *aggregate* and either succeed or fail in totality. Any other bookkeeping, cleanup,
    and notification we need to do can happen via an *event*. We don’t require the
    event handlers to succeed in order for the command to be successful.

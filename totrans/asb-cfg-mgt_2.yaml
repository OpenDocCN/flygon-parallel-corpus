- en: Ansible can be used as a command-line tool for making small changes. However,
    its real power lies in its scripting abilities. While setting up machines, we
    almost always need to do more than one thing at a time. Ansible uses a concept
    named **playbook** to do this. Using playbooks, we can perform many actions at
    once, and across multiple systems. They provide a way to orchestrate deployments,
    ensure a consistent configuration, or simply perform a common task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Playbooks are expressed in **YAML,** and for the most part, Ansible uses a standard
    YAML parser. This means that we have all the features of YAML available to us
    as we write them. For example, we can use the same commenting system in playbook
    as we would in YAML. Many lines of a playbook can also be written and represented
    in YAML data types. See [http://www.yaml.org/](http://www.yaml.org/) for more
    information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Playbooks also open up many opportunities. They allow us to carry the state
    from one command to the other. For example, we can grab the content of a file
    on one machine, register it as a variable, and then use the value on another machine.
    This allows us to make complex deployment mechanisms that will be impossible with
    the Ansible command alone. Additionally, since each module tries to be idempotent,
    we should be able to run a playbook several times and changes will only be made
    if they need to be.

    similar to the Ansible command-line tool. For example, `-k` (`--ask-pass`) and
    `-K` (`--ask-sudo`) make Ansible prompt for the SSH and sudo passwords, respectively;
    `-u` can be used to set the user to use for SSH. However, these options can also
    be set inside the playbooks themselves in the target section. For example, to
    use the play named `example-play.yml`, we can use the following command:'

    will be accessed as `{{ httpd.maxclients }}`. This works with facts from the setup

    or a subset of the machines in an earlier play, we can set `gather_facts` in the
    target section to `false`. The `setup` module can sometimes take a while to run,

    us to call the module as the first keyword inside an `action` key. The second
    task copies Apache's configuration file into place using the second style of the
    task. In this style, use the module name in place of the `action` keyword and
    its value simply becomes its argument. Finally, the last task, the third style,
    shows how to use the service module to restart Apache. In this style, we use the
    module name as the key, as usual, but we supply the arguments as a YAML dictionary.
    This can come in handy when we are providing a large number of arguments to a
    single module, or if the module wants the arguments in a complex form, such as
    the cloud formation module. The latter style is quickly becoming the preferred
    way of writing playbooks, as an increasing number of modules require complex arguments.
    In this book, we will be using this style in order to save space for the examples

    containing the files to be concatenated into the output as the `src` argument,
    and then pass `dest` as the output file. It also accepts many of the same arguments
    (`owner`, `group`, and `mode`) as the other modules that create files. It also
    combines the files in the same order as the `ls -1` command lists them. This means
    we can use the same approach as `udev` and `rc.d`, and prepend numbers to the
    files to ensure that they end up in the correct order.

- en: The `add_host` module is one of the most powerful modules that are available
    in playbooks. `add_host` lets us dynamically add new machines inside a play. We
    can do this using the `uri` module to get a host from our **Configuration Management
    Database** (**CMDB**) and then adding it to the current play. This module will
    also add our host to a group, dynamically creating that group if it does not already
    exist.

- en: The module simply takes a `name` and a `groups` argument, which are rather self-explanatory,
    and sets the hostname and groups. We can also send extra arguments, and these
    are treated in the same way in which extra values in the inventory file are treated.
    This means we can set `ansible_ssh_user`, `ansible_ssh_port`, and so on.

    The `group_by` module can create groups based on the facts about the machines,
    including the ones we set up ourselves using the `add_fact` module explained earlier.
    The `group_by` module accepts one argument, `key`, which takes the name of a group
    the machine will be added to. By combining this with the use of variables, we
    can make the module add a server to a group based on its operating system, virtualization
    technology, or any other fact that we have access to. We can then use this group
    in the target section of any subsequent plays, or in templates.

    In practice, this is often used to avoid Ansible outputting lots of "skipped"
    messages while it is executing. Instead of adding `when` clauses to each task
    that needs to be skipped, we can create a group for machines where the action
    should happen and then use a separate play to configure those machines separately.

- en: The `slurp` module grabs a file from the remote system, encodes it with base
    64, and then returns the result. We can utilize the register keyword in order
    to place the contents into a fact. When using the `slurp` module to fetch files,
    we should be wary of the file size. This module loads the entire file into memory,
    so using `slurp` with large files can consume all available RAM and cause our
    system to crash. Files also need to be transferred from the managed machine to
    the controller machine, and for large files, this could take a considerable amount
    of time.

    separate YAML file, and then include them from your main task.

    conditionals will separately be added to each included task by Ansible automatically.

    however, in circumstances where variables may change, it is.

    and can be decrypted by Ansible transparently. You can use them for includes,
    variable files, tasks lists in roles and any other YAML formatted file that Ansible
    uses. You can also use it with both JSON and YAML files included with the `-e`
    command-line argument to ansible-playbook. Vault files are managed with the `ansible-vault`
    command and can be used as if they were not encrypted at all.

- en: When using a vault file, you need to provide the password so that they can be
    decrypted. This can be done in one of three ways. You can give the `--ask-vault-pass`
    argument to Ansible, which will cause Ansible to prompt for the password every
    time it starts. You can also use the `--vault-password-file` argument, which points
    to a file containing the password. Finally, you can add `vault_password_file`
    to the `ansible.cfg` file to automatically make Ansible use the vault password
    file for every command. It is important to note that only one password can be
    supplied for each Ansible run, so you can't include several different files with
    different passwords.

    standard error, to read from the user you can use `stdin` as usual and finally
    the script needs to print the password to `stdout` before it exits.

- en: In this chapter, we have covered the techniques required when moving from a
    simple setup to a larger deployment. We discussed how to separate your playbook
    into multiple parts using includes. We then looked at how we can package related
    includes and automatically include them all at once using roles. Finally, we discussed
    the pull mode, which allows you to automate the deployment of playbooks on the
    remote node itself.

    building a simple module using bash scripting. We then look at how Ansible searches
    for modules, and how to make it find your own custom ones. Then, we take a look
    at how you can use Python to write more advanced modules using features that Ansible
    provides. Finally we will write a script that configures Ansible to pull its inventory
    from an external source.

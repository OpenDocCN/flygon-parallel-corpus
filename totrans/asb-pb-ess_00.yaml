- en: With the evolution of cloud computing, agile development methodologies, and
    explosion of data in recent years, there is a growing need to manage infrastructure
    at scale. DevOps tools and practices have become a necessity to automate every
    stage of such a scalable, dynamic, and complex infrastructure. Configuration management
    tools are at the core of this devops tool set.

- en: Ansible is a simple, efficient, fast configuration management, orchestration
    and application deployment tool all combined into one. This book helps you to
    get familiar with writing Playbooks, Ansible's automation language. This book
    follows a hands-on approach to show you how to create flexible, dynamic, reusable,
    and data-driven roles. It then takes you through the advanced features of Ansible,
    such as node discovery, clustering, securing data with vault, and managing environments,
    and finally shows you how to use Ansible to orchestrate multitier infrastructure
    stack.

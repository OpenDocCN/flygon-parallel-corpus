- en: To use this book most effectively and to examine, run, and write code that is
    part of exercises supplied in this book, it's essential to set up a learning environment.
    Even though Ansible can work with any type of nodes, virtual machines, cloud servers,
    or bare metal hosts with an operating system installed and SSH service running,
    the preferred mode is to use virtual machines.

    and thus recommend using the open source and freely available software VirtualBox
    and Vagrant, which have support for most of the desktop operating systems, including
    Windows, OSX, and Linux.

    Windows, OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and so on. It provides a layer of hypervisor
    and allows one to create and run virtual machines on top of an existing base OS.
    The code provided along with this book has been tested on 4.3x versions of virtualbox.
    However, any version of virtualbox, which is compatible with the vagrant version
    can be used.'

    to virtualbox. It can automate tasks such as importing an image, specifying resources,
    such as memory and CPUs assigned to VMs, and setting up network interfaces, hostnames,
    user credentials, and so on. Since it provides a text configuration in the form
    of a Vagrant file, virtual machines can be provisioned programmatically, making
    them easy to use it with other tools such as **Jenkins** to automate build and
    test pipelines.'

    with the SSH utility, and Git for Windows is the easiest way to install it on
    Windows. Alternative options such as **Cygwin** exist.'

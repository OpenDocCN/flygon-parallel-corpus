- en: This book is a primer for anyone who has conceptual knowledge of Ansible and
    would like to get started writing Ansible playbooks to automate common infrastructure
    tasks, orchestrate application deployments, and/or manage configurations across
    multiple environments. This book follows an incremental approach, starting with
    the basics such as learning about the anatomy of a playbook and writing simple
    roles to create modular code. Once comfortable with the basics, you will be introduced
    to primitives such as adding dynamic data with variables and templates, and controlling
    execution flow with conditionals and iterators. This is then followed by more
    advanced topics such as node discovery, clustering, encrypting data, and managing
    environments. We conclude with the discussion on the orchestration features of
    Ansible. Let's begin our journey towards being an Ansible practitioner by learning
    about playbooks.

- en: As systems engineer, infrastructure that we typically need to automate contains
    complex multitier applications. Each of which represents a class of servers, for
    example, load balancers, web servers, database servers, caching applications,
    and middleware queues. Since many of these applications have to work in tandem
    to provide a service, there is topology involved as well. For example, a load
    balancer would connect to web servers, which in turn read/write to a database
    and connect to the caching server to fetch in-memory objects. Most of the time,
    when we launch such application stacks, we need to configure these components
    in a very specific order.

    tasks. The preceding example contains three plays, each to configure one layer
    in the multitiered web application. Plays also define the order in which tasks
    are configured. This allows us to orchestrate multitier deployments. For example,
    configure the load balancers only after starting the web servers, or perform two-phase
    deployment where the first phase only adds this configurations and the second
    phase starts the services in the desired order.

    tool need not learn any special programming language to get started with. Ansible

    to use. Later, we will start running plays against a selection of hosts from this
    inventory. If you have an existing inventory, such as cobbler, LDAP, a CMDB software,
    or wish to pull it from a cloud provider, such as ec2, it can be pulled from Ansible
    using the concept of a dynamic inventory.

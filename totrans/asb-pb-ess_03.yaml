    You also learned about the concepts of plays which map hosts to tasks. Writing
    tasks in a single playbook may work fine for a very simple setup. However, if
    we have multiple applications spanning across number of hosts, this will quickly
    become unmanageable.

    of identical servers in a repeatable fashion.

    which allows us to define what we need to configure in each of these groups, and
    call them by name. That's exactly what roles do. Ansible roles allow us to configure
    groups of nodes at the same time, without repeating ourselves. Roles also provide
    a way to create modular code, which then can then be shared and reused.

    the preceding diagram is for:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each role contains a directory which is named after itself, for example, `Nginx`,
    with `roles/` as its parent directory. Each named role directory contains one
    or more optional subdirectories. The most common subdirectories to be present
    are tasks, templates, and handlers. Each of these subdirectories typically contain
    the `main.yml` file, which is a default file.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tasks contain the core logic, for example, they will have code specifications
    to install packages, start services, manage files, and so on. If we consider a
    role to be a movie, a task would be the protagonist.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tasks alone cannot do everything. Considering our analogy with movies, it's
    incomplete without the supporting cast. Protagonists have friends, cars, lovers,
    and antagonists to complete the story. Similarly, tasks consume data, call for
    static or dynamic files, trigger actions, and so on. That's where files, handlers,
    templates, defaults, and `vars` come in. Let's look at what these are for.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vars and defaults provide data about your application/role, for example, which
    port your server should run on, the path for storing the application data, which
    user to run the service as, and so on. Default variables were introduced in version
    1.3 and these allow us to provide sane defaults. These can later be overridden
    from other places, for example, `vars`, `group_vars`, and `host_vars`. Variables
    are merged and precedence rules apply. This gives us a lot of flexibility to configure
    our servers selectively. For example, running the web server on port `80` on all
    hosts except for the ones in the staging environment, which should run it on port
    `8080`.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Files and templates subdirectories provide options for managing files. Typically,
    the files subdirectory is used to copy over static files to destination hosts,
    for example, some application installers archive static text files, and so on.
    In addition to static files, frequently you may need to manage files that are
    are generated on the fly. For example, a configuration file that has parameters
    such as port, user, and memory, which can be provided dynamically using variables.
    Generating such files requires a special type of primitive, called templates.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tasks can trigger actions based on the change of a state or a condition. In
    a movie, the protagonist may chase the antagonist and take revenge based on the
    provocation or an event. An example event is kidnapping the protagonist's lady
    love. Similarly, you may need to perform an action on your hosts, for example,
    restarting a service based on what happened earlier, which could be a change in
    the state of a configuration file. This trigger-action relationship can be specified
    using a handler.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Continuing our analogy, many popular movies have sequels and sometimes even
    prequels. In such cases, one should watch it in a particular order, as the storyline
    of a sequel depends on something that happened in the previous movie. Similarly,
    a role can have a dependency on another role. A very common example is, before
    installing Tomcat, Java should be present on the system. These dependencies are
    defined in the meta subdirectory of a role.

    If we launch an Ansible run after making this change then, while executing, it

    drift, and copy it over to the changed file. With Ansible, this is where we will

    to the change in the state for the `configuration` file, which triggers the handler.

    have not mentioned the base role in the `www` playbook? This is where meta information
    is useful. Remember we had specified a dependency on the base role inside `meta/main.yml`
    for Nginx? That's what did the trick.

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to use roles to provide abstraction and to
    help modularizing code for reuse. That's exactly what you see community doing.
    Creating roles, and sharing them with you. You also learned about `include` directives,
    directory layout for roles, and adding role dependencies. We then went on to refactor
    our code and created a base role, the Nginx role. We also looked at how to manage
    events and take actions using handlers.

    across multiple data centers. Since we have the `server_name` parameter hardcoded
    in to the `config` file, we will have to create one file per server. This also
    means that we will manage hundreds of static files, which will quickly get out
    of control. Our infrastructure is dynamic, and managing change is one of the most
    common aspects of a DevOps engineer''s routine tasks. If tomorrow, our company
    policy states that we should run web servers on the port 8080 instead of the port
    80, only in a production environment, imagine the headache you''d get having to
    change all these files individually. Wouldn''t it be better to have a single file
    that takes dynamic inputs, which are specific to the host it''s running on? This
    is exactly what templates are for and, as depicted in the following diagram, a
    single template could replace a multitude of static files:'

    ability to separate data and code. In our example, the `default.conf` file is
    a configuration file that is specific to an Nginx web server. The configuration
    parameters, such as ports, users, paths, and so on, remain generic and constant
    at all times, no matter who installs and configures them. What is not constant
    are the values those parameters take. That''s what is specific to our organization.

    that the code and data are split, there is nothing in the code that is specific
    to a particular organization. This makes it easy to share the site with the world
    for anyone who finds it useful. That's exactly what you would find on Ansible-Galaxy
    or even on GitHub, fueling the growth of tools, such as Ansible. Instead of reinventing

    it, fill in the data specific to the code, and get the work done.

    template engine. Since Ansible is written in Python, it becomes the default choice
    for most users, just like other Python-based configuration management systems,
    such as **Fabric** and **SaltStack**. The name Jinja originated from the Japanese

    where this data comes from, which is then embedded in the template at runtime.
    Data can come from either facts or variables. When it comes to a Jinja2 template,
    the same rules apply to the usage of facts and variables. Facts are a type of
    variable; the differentiating factor here is the origin of the two. Facts are
    automatically available and discovered at runtime, and variables are user-defined.

    hosts in a production environment should use local package repositories or web
    servers in staging and should run on the port 8080\. All this without changing
    the code, and driven by data alone is done, by variables.

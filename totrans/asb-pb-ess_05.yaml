- en: Ansible comes with a wide variety of built-in modules that allow us to manage
    various system components, for example, users, packages, network, files, and services.
    Ansible's battery-included approach also provides the ability to integrate the
    components with cloud platforms, databases, and applications such as **Jira**,
    **Apache**, **IRC**, and **Nagios**, and so on. However, every now and then, we
    would find ourselves in a position where we may not find a module that exactly
    does the job for us. For example, installing a package from source involves downloading
    it, extracting a source tarball, followed by the make command, and finally, "make
    install". There is no single module that does this. There will also be times when
    we would like to bring in our existing scripts that we have spent nights creating
    and just have them invoked or scheduled with Ansible, for example, nightly backup
    scripts. Ansible's command modules would come to our rescue in such situations.

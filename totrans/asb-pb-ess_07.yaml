- en: You learned about conditional controls in the previous chapter. Our journey
    into Ansible's world of control structures continues with iterative controls.
    Often, we need to create a list of directories, install a bunch of packages, or
    define and walk over nested hashes or dictionaries. Traditional programming languages
    use the `for` or `while` loops for iteration. Ansible replaces them with the `with`
    statements.

    are, arrays and hashes. The `php5-fpm` role takes an array with a list of packages
    and creates a task to install those in a loop. To create MySQL databases and users,
    we defined variable dictionaries or hashes and iterated them. Finally, we added
    Nginx template configurations to create multiple virtual hosts serving PHP applications
    by iterating a nested dictionary.

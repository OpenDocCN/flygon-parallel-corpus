- en: For most real-world scenarios, we would need to create a cluster of compute
    nodes with the applications running on top, which are linked together. For example,
    the WordPress site that we have been building requires web servers and databases
    connected together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clustered infrastructure has a topology where one class of nodes should be able
    to discover information about the different, or the same, class of servers. For
    example, the WordPress application servers need to discover information about
    database servers, and load balancers need to know about the IP address/hostname
    of each web server that it's serving traffic to. This chapter focuses on what
    primitives Ansible offers to group together nodes and discover the attributes
    of interconnected nodes.

    In addition to these, there are a few variables that define the meta information
    about the nodes, inventory, and plays, for example, which groups a node belongs
    to, what groups are part of the inventory, which nodes belong to which group,
    and so on. These variables, which are implicitly set, are called **magic** variables,
    and are very useful for discovering nodes and topology information. The following
    table lists the most useful magic variables, and their description:'

- en: We created the Nginx and MySQL roles to serve the WordPress site. However, if
    we have to build a scalable site, we also need to add a load balancer to the mix.
    This load balancer will then act as an entry point for the incoming requests,
    and then spread the traffic across the available web servers. Let's consider the
    following scenario, where our fifanews site has become an instant hit. The traffic
    is growing exponentially, and the single web server approach that we have been
    using is showing cracks. We need to scale out horizontally and add more web servers.
    Once we start creating more web servers, we also need to have some mechanism to
    balance traffic across those. We have been tasked to create a `haproxy` role,
    which would discover all web servers in our cluster automatically and add to its
    configurations.

    the cluster to connect them together. We started with the introduction to magic
    variables and looked at the most commonly used ones. We then started creating
    a role for haproxy, which auto-discovers web servers and creates configurations
    dynamically. Finally, we looked at the issue of accessing information about hosts
    not in the playbook, and you learned how to solve it by enabling the caching of
    facts. Magic variables are very powerful, especially while orchestrating your
    infrastructure with Ansible, where discovering topology information automatically
    is very useful.

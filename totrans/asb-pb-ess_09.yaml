- en: Using variables, we saw how to separate data and code. Often, the data provided
    is sensitive, for example, user passwords, data base credentials, API keys, and
    other organization-specific information. Ansible-playbooks, being a source code,
    are most commonly stored in version control repositories such as a **git**, which
    makes it even more difficult to protect this sensitive information in a collaborative
    environment. Starting with version 1.5, Ansible provides a solution called **vault**
    to store and retrieve such sensitive information securely, using proven encryption
    technologies. The objective of using vault is to encrypt data that can then be
    stored and shared freely with a version control system, such as git, without the
    values being compromised.

    lets you manage data securely. The Ansible-vault utility can either let you create
    an encrypted file by launching an editor interface, or encrypt an existing file.
    In either case, it will ask for a vault password, which is then used to encrypt
    the data with the AES cipher. The encrypted contents can be stored in a version
    control system without being compromised. Since the AES is based on shared secret,
    the same password needs to be provided for decryption too. To provide the password,
    there are two options, while launching Ansible, run the `--ask-vault-pass` option
    to prompt for the password, and the `--vault-password-file` option to provide
    the path to the file that contains the password.

    on the **Rijndael** symmetric block cipher, named after, and developed by, two
    Belgian cryptographers—Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen. Initially, established
    by (the U.S.) **National Institute of Standards and Technology** (**NIST**) in
    2001, AES is an algorithm adopted by the U.S. government to share classified information,
    and is the most popular symmetric-key cryptography algorithm. AES is also the
    first publicly accessible open cypher approved by the **National Security Agency**
    (**NSA**).'

    to Nginx and you learned how to securely store private keys and certificates for
    the web server using the vault and copying them using templates. Note that Ansible
    vault offers a way to provide data to Ansible modules securely. In addition to

    However, as the complexity grows, it is imperative that we have a workflow that
    involves writing code and testing it in development environments, followed by
    an intensive QA cycle to make sure that the code is tested for stability in the
    staging, or preproduction, environment before we finally release it to production.
    In order to simulate a real-world behavior, these environments have to run identical
    stacks of applications, but most likely at different scales. For example, staging
    will be a small-scale replica of production with fewer servers, and most commonly,
    development environments would run on individual workstations in virtualized environments.
    Even though all these environments run an identical application stack, they have
    to be isolated from each other and must have environment-specific configurations,

    configurations without having to modify the roles. We would be able to create

    group under `group_vars`, the value of the parameters will be set to the one defined
    in '`webserver`', which is more specific. This is the behavior that we exploit

    It's a good idea to name them after the environments. Add hosts that are specific
    to that environment and group them. A group can be of any criteria, such as a
    role, location, server racks, and so on. For example, create a '`webservers`'
    group to add all the Apache web servers, or a group called '`in`' to add all the
    hosts belonging to that location.

    of inventory groups and inventory variables, specifically, the `group_vars` file.
    This was followed by the two approaches used to manage environments. Finally,
    we refactored our code, went on to create the `dev` environment, and tested it
    by overriding one variable from the environment. In the next chapter, you are
    going to learn about infrastructure orchestration and how Ansible shines when
    it comes to orchestrating complex infrastructure workflows, zero downtime deployments,
    and so on.

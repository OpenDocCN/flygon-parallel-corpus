    Pentesting is something that grew out of computer concerns during the 1960s. As
    computer systems began to distribute data more, ensuring the security of that
    data became crucial. After much discussion of how communication lines could be
    penetrated, it was recommended that some type of "penetration assessment" be used
    to assess computer systems and communication lines with "real threat-like" assessments.
    Moving forward to the early 1970s, tiger teams were created as the first penetration
    testing teams and carried out operations similar to the tactics you will see and
    read about in this book. The primary responsibility of these tiger teams was to
    discover vulnerabilities and assess the threat impact level based on manually
    exploiting the vulnerabilities found.

    and is becoming a common way to assess a corporation's infrastructure and security
    posture. Businesses hire pentesters to hack their companies and highlight areas
    of weakness ethically. The purpose of pentesting is to let the good guys know
    about vulnerabilities before the bad guys find out about them.

    and what it means to execute pentesting successfully, so as to lay a foundation
    for our work in this book. We need to understand it so that we can think like
    a pentester and move through the book with that thought process. After all, to
    know the enemy, you have to think like the enemy.

    testing. Then, we will set up a Kali Linux system locally on our own machines
    and explore the tools installed on the operating system. Do not worry about not
    having experience in Linux; this chapter will cover everything you need to know.
    We will also go over some pentesting tools and install some tools when needed.
    We will also learn how to write a basic script that we can run against our own
    host.

- en: The term "penetration tester" is an interesting job title for a professional
    to have. While the job title may be a good conversation starter, and despite the
    funny remarks, penetration testing can be one of the most rewarding careers within
    cybersecurity. So, what is penetration testing, or pentesting?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Penetration testing is the evaluation of a system's attack surface through manual
    and automated exploitation. This involves using multiple sources to discover and
    exploit issues within systems. A system is a set of people, mechanisms, software,
    and policies that make up an entity (system).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way we can look at it is that pentesting highlights how systems work
    and reveals the vulnerabilities that leave them exposed to hacking, enabling the
    vulnerabilities to be corrected before adversaries can exploit them. This gives
    personnel an understanding of their technology, its security, and how attackers
    think about and exploit such systems. In today's environments, adversaries are
    always playing a cat-and-mouse game with companies. It is a pentester's job to
    ensure that those systems have more skilled cats to hunt the malicious mice.

    that helps companies stay in the game. As many of us have seen, the news loves
    to run stories on companies that have been attacked by cybercriminals. Those attacks
    cost companies millions of dollars in losses as well as diminishing their reputation.
    As many of these companies are small companies, they stand less of a chance of
    bouncing back. In fact, 60% of small businesses fold within 6 months of a cyberattack.
    Penetration testing is a high-level quality assurance check that makes sure that
    companies can close gaps in their attack surface and solve issues before they
    get exploited, ultimately keeping them out of the news and keeping them from suffering
    severe monetary repercussions.

    great way to discover and validate the internals of source code and system setups.

    security assessments on the EC2 instances within your AWS cloud environment. The
    scanner checks for common vulnerabilities, exposures, and best practices – remediations
    – that will allow you to securely and quickly harden your environment. The drawback
    to AWS Inspector is that there is a service fee, so we will avoid using it in
    this book. However, feel free to read up on the service.

    For instance, there was **EternalBlue**, an exploit that attacks the **Server
    Message Block** service and allows attackers to gain access to victims' systems.

    a server for a ransomware payload that generated a lot of headaches a few years

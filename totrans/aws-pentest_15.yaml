    projects that are good to note and dig into. Throughout this book, we have taken
    quite a bit of a high-level view as well as a bunch of low-level views (hands-on
    portions) to create a cohesive understanding of pentesting and what it means to
    AWS. This final chapter is going to discuss an open source framework that is used
    by red teamers, penetration testers, and ethical hackers that allows businesses
    to test real adversary tactics and methods on their organizations – to ultimately
    better the controls and defenses by locating areas of weakness. We will then end
    with a fun exercise that came from a phishing project I came up with back in 2019,
    where we will learn how to leverage EC2 to set up quick and impactful phishing
    exercises that you can use on an authorized organization.

- en: Next, once we discover our targets, we move toward **collecting** and **exfiltrating**
    data outside the network. What this means is that we can use techniques and procedures

    a threat or malicious hacker that has access to the AWS environment would gather
    data and push it to their server that resides behind proxy servers.

    server or website, bringing services down via **DDoS** or **DoS**. These types

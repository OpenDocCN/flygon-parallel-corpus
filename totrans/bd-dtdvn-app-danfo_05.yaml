    compared to other programming languages, but when it comes to data presentation
    and the client side, **JavaScript** reigns supreme. From its robust data presentation
    tools to its ready availability in the browser to ease of setup, JavaScript is

    you an efficient tool for data analysis and manipulation in JavaScript. We'll
    cover the core data structures of Danfo.js – DataFrames and Series. We'll show
    you how to load different types of files, such as JSON, Excel, and CSV, into Danfo.js,

    that make data analysis and preprocessing in JavaScript easier.

    there are a lot of processes and tasks to be carried out, things such as model
    deployment, creating API routes with frameworks such as **Flask**, **FastAPI**,
    or **Django**, and then using JavaScript to send HTTP requests to the model. You
    can clearly observe that the process involves a lot of JavaScript. It would be
    super awesome if we could perform all these processes in just JavaScript, wouldn't
    it? Well, the good news is that we can.

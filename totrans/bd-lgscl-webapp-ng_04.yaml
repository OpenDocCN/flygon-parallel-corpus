    custom validator class. The advantage of creating a directive is that it allows
    us to incorporate the directive in a template-driven form approach, where the
    directive can be embedded in the view HTML. Or, if the form has been generated
    using a model (reactive approach), we can directly use the validator class while
    creating the `Control` objects.

- en: At first, the requirement of checking duplicate names against a data source
    (the *mLab* database) seems to be too a specific requirement and cannot be handled
    by a generic validator. But with some sensible assumptions and design choices,
    we can still implement a validator that can handle all types of remote validation,
    including workout name validation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The plan is to create a validator that externalizes the actual validation logic.
    The directive will take the validation function as input. This implies that the
    actual validation logic is not a part of the validator, but a part of the component
    that actually needs to validate input data. The job of the directive is just to
    call the function and return the appropriate error keys based on the function's
    return value.

    support some sort of view encapsulation too! This allows us to isolate styles

    a conservative approach. Be it *Workout Builder* or the *Workout Runner* (*7 Minute
    Workout*) app, all the components that we built derive their style from *bootstrap
    CSS* and from custom styles defined in `app.css`. No component has defined its
    own style.

    we do need to deviate. This is especially true when we are building self-contained,
    packaged, and reusable components.

    (for inline style) and `styleUrl` (external style sheet) properties on the `@Component`
    decorator. Let's play around with the `style` property and see what Angular does.

    styles.

    embedded the same CSS in an external CSS file and used this: `styleUrls:[''static/css/ajax-button.css'']`
    Angular would have still in-lined the styles into the `head` section, by fetching
    the CSS, parsing it, and then injecting it.'

    defined style, but the reverse is not true. Global styles will still affect the
    component unless overridden in the component itself.

    paradigm. The styles defined on the component never leak into the global styles.
    All this awesomeness without any effort!

    of isolation, use the component's `style`/`styleUrl` property instead of using
    the old-school approach of having a common CSS file for all styles.

    work independently and are reusable. Each component already has its own template
    and behavior. In addition to that, we can also encapsulate component styles, allowing

    We explored the **renderer** service, which allows component view manipulation

    us bind to a host element's *events*, *attributes*, and *properties*.

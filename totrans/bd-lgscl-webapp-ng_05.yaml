    track of what your application knows at a given point, what we call the state
    of the application. There might be other issues, such as parts of your application
    not being in agreement with what they know. An update that happened in one part
    may not have been applied to some other part and you scratch your head, thinking
    should it be this hard and is there a better answer?

    perceived that the MVC pattern simply did not scale. It did not scale for large
    code bases as they tended to become fragile, generally complicated as more and
    more features were added, and most of all, unpredictable. Now let's hang on that
    word for a second, unpredictable.

    is somewhat under control as long as one model talks to one view and vice versa.
    This is, however, seldom the case. In the preceding diagram, we see that suddenly
    a view can talk to more than one model and vice versa, which means we have a cascading
    effect on the system and we suddenly lose control. Sure, it doesn't look so bad
    with just one deviating arrow, but imagine that this one is suddenly ten arrows,
    then we have a real problem on our hands.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the core of the Flux pattern is a unidirectional data flow. It uses some
    core concepts to achieve this flow. The main idea is when an event is created
    on a UI, through the interaction of a user, an action is created. This action
    consists of an intent and a payload. The intent is what you are trying to achieve.
    Think of the intent as a verb. Add an item, remove an item, and so on. The payload
    is the data change that needs to happen to achieve our intent. If we are trying
    to add an item, then the payload is the newly created item. The action is then
    propagated in the flow with the help of a dispatcher. The action and its data
    eventually end up in a store.

    an application consisting of two views. In the first view, the user will select
    an item from a list. This should result in an action being created. This action
    will then be dispatched, by the dispatcher. The action and its payload will end
    up in a store. The other view meanwhile listens to changes from the store. When
    an item is selected, the second view will be made aware and can, therefore, indicate
    in its UI that a specific item has been selected. On a high level, our application
    and its flow will look like the following:'

    The library handles just what we mentioned previously, namely it is able to register
    and fire off events. It is a simple implementation of the pub-sub pattern. Basically, `EventEmitter`
    allows you to subscribe to certain events and also allows you to trigger events.

    ES2015 imports to import other files, but most of our code was written in ES5
    so why not use most of what ES2015 gives us? Another improvement we can make is
    introducing immutability and making sure our store is not mutated but transitions
    from one state to another.

- en: 'The other thing we can undertake is adding immutability. The reasons for using
    immutability in the first place are to make your code more predictable, and some
    frameworks can use this for simpler change detection and can rely on reference
    checking over dirty checking. This was the case when AngularJS got its whole change
    detection mechanism changed when Angular was written. From a practical standpoint,
    this means that there are functions we can target in our store and apply immutable
    principles on. The first principle is to not mutate but create an entirely new
    state, instead of where the new state is *the old state + the state change*. A
    simple example of this is the following:'

    `oldState` variable. There are functions that will help us with this, called `Object.assign`
    and the function filter. We can use these for updating scenarios, as well as adding
    or removing things from a list. Let us use these and rewrite part of our store
    code. Let''s highlight the code we mean to change:'

- en: We can see that the `createProduct()` method uses an ES2015 construct, namely
    the spread parameter, `...`, which takes a list and turns its members into a comma-separated
    list of items. `Object.assign()` is used to copy over all the values from an object
    so we store the value of an object rather than its reference. The `removeProduct()`
    method becomes very simple when we use the filter method. We simply create a projection
    that does not include the product that we should remove; removing has never been
    this easy or elegant. We haven't mutated anything.

- en: Our cleanup started with the view; we wanted to remove a direct connection to
    the dispatcher and also stop having to use magic strings as this is quite error
    prone, and it's easy to misspell. Instead, we can rely on constants. To remedy
    this, we created an action creator class that talked to the dispatcher instead.

    we further improved the store by adding more actions to it and also started to
    refer to the constants.

    The reason for doing so is that when we successfully manage to create a product,
    we need to read from the endpoint to get an updated version of the products list. We
    don't see that in detail, but it is being invoked through us calling `getProducts()`.
    Again, it is nice to have a wrapper on everything being dispatched, that wrapper
    being an action creator.

- en: We set out trying only to explain the Flux architecture pattern. It would have
    been very easy to start mentioning how it fits with React and how there are nice
    libraries and tools that support Flux and React. That would, however, have taken our focus away
    from explaining the pattern from a more framework-agnostic viewpoint. Therefore,
    the rest of this chapter set out to explain core concepts such as actions, action
    creator, dispatcher, store, and uniform data flow. Little by little, we improved
    the code to start using constants, action creators, and a nice supporting library
    such as `EventEmitter`. We explained how HTTP fits into this and, lastly, we discussed
    how we could build out our application. There is a lot more that can be said about
    Flux, but we chose to limit the scope to understand the fundamentals so we can
    compare its approach as we dive into Redux and NgRx in later chapters.

    Reactive Programming** (**FRP**). It deals more with how to reason around the
    fact that data arrives seemingly when it wants to. As messy as that sounds, even
    that can be modeled to create a sense of structure and order if we think of our
    data as a stream. More on that in the next chapter.

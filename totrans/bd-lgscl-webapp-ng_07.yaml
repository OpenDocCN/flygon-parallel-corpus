- en: Operators are functions we can call on our streams to perform manipulation in
    many different ways. Operators are immutable, which makes the stream easy to reason
    about and will also make it quite easy to test. As you will see throughout this
    chapter, we will seldom deal with just one stream, but many streams, and it is
    understanding how to forge and control these streams that allow you to go from
    thinking it's *dark magic* to actually being able to apply RxJS when and where
    you need it.

- en: You almost always start out coding with RxJS by creating a stream of static
    values. Why static values? Well, there is no need to make it unnecessarily complex,
    and all you really need to start reasoning is an `Observable`. As you gradually
    progress in your problem solving, you might replace the static values with a more
    appropriate call to an AJAX call, or from another asynchronous source that your
    values originate from.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You then start thinking about what you want to achieve. This leads you to consider
    which operators you might need and in which order you need to apply them. You
    might also think about how to divide your problem up; this usually means creating
    more than one stream, where each stream solves a specific problem that connects
    to the larger problem you are trying to solve.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: That is a very basic example of how we can create a stream. We use the `of()` creation
    operator, which takes any number of arguments. All the arguments are emitted,
    one by one, as soon as there is a subscriber. In the preceding code, we also subscribe
    to `staticValuesStream$` by calling the `subscribe()` method and passing a function
    that takes the emitted value as a parameter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's introduce an operator, `map()`, which acts like a projection and allows
    you to change what is being emitted. The `map()` operator gets called on each
    value in the stream before it is emitted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a projection, like so:'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'In the preceding code, we have appended the `map()` operator to `staticValuesStream$` and
    we apply it to each value before emitting it and incrementing it by one. The resulting
    data is therefore changed. This is how you append operators to a stream: simply
    create the stream, or take an existing one, and append the operators one by one.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's add another operator, `filter()`, to ensure that we really understand
    how to work with operators. What does `filter()` do. Well, just like the `map()` operator,
    it is applied to each value, but instead of creating a projection, it decides
    which values will be emitted. `filter()` takes a Boolean. Any expression evaluated
    to `true` means the value will be emitted; if `false`, the expression will not
    be emitted.

- en: 'You use the `filter()` operator in the following way:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE2]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We add the `filter()` operator by chaining it to the existing `map()` operator.
    The condition we give our `filter()` operator says to only return `true` for values
    that are divisible by `2`, that's what the modulus operator does. We know from
    before that the `map()`   operator alone ensures that the values `2`, `3` , `4`,
    and `5` are emitted. These are the values that are now being evaluated by the
    `filter()` operator. Out of those four values, only `2` and `4` fulfill the condition
    set out by the `filter()` operator.

    always be as simple as the preceding code. It might not be possible to anticipate
    exactly what gets emitted. For those occasions, we have a few tricks we can use.
    One such trick is to use the `do()` operator, which will allow us to inspect each
    value without changing it. This gives us ample opportunity to use it for debugging
    purposes. Depending on where we are in the stream, the `do()` operator will output
    different values. Let''s look at different situations where it matters where the `do()` operator
    is applied:'

- en: So far, we have shown how to create a stream and use some very basic operators
    on it to change what values get emitted. We also introduced how to inspect your
    stream without changing it by using the `do()` operator. Not all operators are
    as easy to understand as the `map()`, `filter()`, and `do()` operators. There
    are different tactics you can use to try to understand what each operator does
    so you know when to use them. Using the `do()` operator is one way, but there
    is a graphical approach you can take. This approach is known as a marble diagram.
    It consists of an arrow that represents time passing from left to right. There
    are circles, or marbles, on this arrow that represent emitted values. The marbles
    have a value in them, but the distance between the marbles might also describe
    what is happening over time. A marble diagram usually consists of at least two
    arrows with marbles on them, as well as an operator. The idea is to represent
    what happens to a stream when an operator is applied. The second arrow usually
    represents the resulting stream.

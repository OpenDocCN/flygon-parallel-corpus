    Our approach has a flaw, though: we retry our AJAX attempts far too often. If
    we are actually dealing with an intermittent network connection, we need to have
    some kind of delay between attempts. It is reasonable to set a delay between attempts
    of at least 30 seconds or more. We can accomplish that by using a slightly different
    retry operator that takes milliseconds rather than a number of attempts as an

    how we want all the retries to end when it finally gives up. In the preceding
    code, the stream just completes after the stream is retried after *x* number of
    times with no successful result. However, we may want the stream to error out

    number of failed attempts.

- en: This isn't a perfect approach, though; imagine that you want to investigate
    what type of error you get back. In the case of AJAX requests being made, it matters
    whether we get a 400-something error or a 500-something error back as HTTP status
    code. They mean different things.  With 500 errors, something is very wrong on
    the backend, and we probably want to give up straight away. With a 404 error,
    however, this implies the resource isn't there, but in the case with an intermittent
    network connection, this means the resource can't be reached due to our connection
    being offline. For that reason, a 404 error might be worth retrying. To solve
    that in code, we need to inspect the value being emitted to determine what to
    do. We can inspect values using the `do()` operator.

    the effect an operator has one two or more streams. We do this by drawing the
    streams as a line and values as circles on the lines. The operator is shown as
    verb below the input streams. Following operator is a third stream, the result
    of taking the input streams and applying the operator, a so - called marble diagram.
    The line represents a continuous timeline. We take this concept and bring it to
    testing. What this means is that we can express our incoming values as a graphical
    representation and apply our algorithm to it and assert on the result.

    The problem is tree shaking, a process we use to get rid of unused code. Tree
    shaking has a hard time determining what you use and don''t use, respectively.
    You may actually import a `map()` operator and it gets added to the Observable.

    in the final bundle. It is, as we mentioned before, hard for the tree-shaking
    process to know what is used and what is not, with the current approach. For that
    reason, a big rewrite has happened in RxJS, adding something called pipeable operators,

    the prototype, and that is the fact that it creates a dependency. If the library

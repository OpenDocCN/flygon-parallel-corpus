    a local weather application that can retrieve current weather data. You have created
    some amount of value; however, if you don't put your app on the web, you end up
    creating zero value. Delivering something is difficult, delivering something to
    production is even more difficult. You want to follow a strategy that results
    in a reliable, high quality, and flexible release.

    a Local Weather Web Application*, is fragile. We need to be able to deliver the
    frontend app separately from the backend app, which is a very important decoupling
    to retain the flexibility of being able to push separate app and server updates.
    In addition, decoupling will ensure that as the various tools and technologies
    in your application stack inevitably fall out of support or favor, you will be
    able to replace your frontend or backend without a full rewrite of your system.

    runtime, which will be installed in the next section. The Docker runtime is capable
    of running self-contained Docker images, which is defined by the aforementioned
    `Dockerfile`. `duluca/minimal-node-web-server` is based off of the lightweight
    Linux operating system Alpine. Alpine is a completely pared down version of Linux
    that doesn't come with any GUI, drivers or even most CLI tools you may expect
    from a Linux system. As a result, the OS is around only ~5 MB in size. The base
    package then installs Node.js, which itself is around ~10 MB in size and my custom
    Node.js-based Express.js web server, resulting in a tiny ~15 MB image. The Express
    server is configured to serve the contents of the `/usr/src/app` folder. In the
    preceding `Dockerfile`, we merely copy the contents of the `/dist` folder in our
    development environment and place it into the `/usr/src/app` folder. We will later
    build and execute this image, which will run our Express web server containing
    the output of our `dist` folder.

    its origins all the way back to the original base image that is the foundation
    of the web server. I encourage you to vet every Docker image you use in this manner
    to understand what exactly it brings to the table for your needs. You may find
    it either overkill or has features you never knew about that can make your life
    a lot easier. Note that the parent images require a specific version of `duluca/minimal-node-web-server` at `8.11.1`.
    This is quite intentional, and as the reader, you should choose the latest available
    version of a Docker image you find. However, if you don't specify a version number,
    you will always get the latest version of the image. As more versions of an image
    is published, you may pull a future version that may break your application. For
    this reason, always specify a version number for images you're depending on.

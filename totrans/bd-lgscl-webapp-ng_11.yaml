    App for Production Release*, we mentioned the need to deliver a high-quality application.
    Currently, the app has a terrible look and feel to it, which is only fit for a
    website created in the late 1990s. The first impression a user or a client will
    get about your product or your work is very important, so we must be able to create
    a great looking application that also delivers a great user experience across
    mobile and desktop browsers.

    This gets worse, as the feature set of an application rapidly grows. It is no
    fun to write great and modular code backing your views, but then revert to CSS
    hacks and inline styles in a rush to improve your application.

    with Angular. If you learn how to leverage Angular Material effectively, the features
    you create will look and work great from the get-go, whether you're working on
    small or large applications. Angular Material will make you a far more effective
    web developer because it ships with a wide variety of user controls that you can
    leverage, and you won't have to worry about browser compatibility. As an added
    bonus, writing custom CSS will become a rarity.

    provide their own code generators. At time of publication, Angular Material ships
    with three rudimentary generators to create Angular components with a side navigation,
    a dashboard layout, or a data table. You can read more about generator schematics
    at [https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics](https://material.angular.io/guide/schematics).

    that file, breaking my suggested `material.module.ts` pattern from earlier. Further,
    a new `SideNavComponent` is added to the app as a separate component, but as mentioned
    in the *Side Navigation* section in [Chapter 14](c1386d03-1f04-49e0-a623-bc5c64be089c.xhtml),
    *Design Authentication and Authorization*, such a navigation experience needs
    to be implemented at the very root of your application.

    who must rely on specialized software or keyboard features such as tabs to navigate

    a `<span>` element, surrounded with a `<p>`, so the superscript style can be applied
    to the unit, such as `<span class="unit">℉</span>`, where unit is a CSS class
    to make it look like a superscript element.

    the design. However, each deviation from the library will have maintainability
    consequences down the line. Unless you're truly building a business around displaying
    weather data, you should defer any further optimizations to the end of the project,
    as time permits, and if experience is any guide, you will not be making this optimization.

    awareness of the current versions, then discover latest available versions, and,

- en: Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable platform for processing
    streaming data in a real-time manner. It became an Apache top-level project in
    September 2014, and was previously an Apache Incubator project since September
    2013.

- en: Real-time processing on a massive scale has become a requirement of businesses.
    Apache Storm provides the capability to process data (a.k.a tuples or stream)
    as and when it arrives in a real-time manner with distributed computing options.
    The ability to add more machines to the Storm cluster makes Storm scalable. Then,
    the third most important thing that comes with storm is fault tolerance. If the
    storm program (also known as topology) is equipped with reliable spout, it can
    reprocess the failed tuples lost due to machine failure and also give fault tolerance.
    It is based on XOR magic, which will be explained in [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The
    Storm Anatomy"), *The Storm Anatomy*.

    It is a very common use case of Storm. Data can be extracted or read from any
    source. Here, the data can be complex XML, a JDBC result set row, or simply a
    few key-value records. Data (also known as tuples in Storm) can be enriched on
    the fly with more information, transformed into the required storage format, and
    stored in a NoSQL/RDBMS data store. All of these things can be achieved at a very
    high throughput in a real-time manner with simple storm programs. Using the Storm
    ETL pipeline, you can ingest into a big data warehouse at high speed.'

    is able to process millions of tweets per second on a large cluster. It depends
    on how well the Storm topology is written, how well it is tuned, and the cluster
    size.

- en: Before Storm became popular, real-time or near-real-time processing problems
    were solved using intermediate brokers and with the help of message queues. Listener
    or worker processes run using the Python or Java languages. For parallel processing,
    code was dependent on the threading model supplied using the programming language
    itself. Many times, the old style of working did not utilize CPU and memory very
    well. In some cases, mainframes were used as well, but they also became outdated
    over time. Distributed computing was not so easy. There were either many intermediate
    outputs or hops in this old style of working. There was no way to perform a fail
    replay automatically. Storm addressed all of these pain areas very well. It is
    one of the best real-time computation frameworks available for use.

    you want to set up a large cluster, go for distributed installation. If you want
    to learn Storm, then go for a single machine installation. If you want to connect
    to an existing Storm cluster, use client mode. Finally, if you want to perform
    development on an IDE, simply unzip the `storm` TAR and point to all dependencies
    of the `storm` library. At the initial learning phase, a single-machine storm
    installation is actually what you need.

    It is a horizontal scaling option. The following figure explains this case in
    detail. In this figure, we have five physical machines, and to increase fault
    tolerance in the systems, we are running Zookeeper on two machines. As shown in
    the diagram, **Machine 1** and **Machine 2** are a group of Zookeeper machines;
    one of them is the leader at any point of time, and when it dies, the other becomes
    the leader. **Nimbus** is a lightweight process, so it can run on either machine,
    1 or 2\. We also have **Machine 3**, **Machine 4**, and **Machine 5** dedicated
    for performing actual processing. Each one of these machines (3, 4, and 5) requires
    a supervisor daemon to run over there. Machines 3, 4, and 5 should know where
    the Nimbus/Zookeeper daemon is running and that entry should be present in their
    `storm.yaml`.

    running (this can be 1 or 2). All Supervisor machines must add the Zookeeper IP
    addresses (1 and 2) to `storm.yaml`. The Storm UI daemon should run on the Nimbus

    topologies and check the status of running topologies from command-line options.
    Storm versions older than 0.9 should put the `yaml` file inside `$STORM_HOME/.storm/storm.yaml`

    *Getting Acquainted with Storm*, Storm is a platform for processing large amounts
    of data in real time. Storm applications are often written in Java, but Storm
    supports other languages as well, including Python. While the concepts are similar
    across languages, the details vary by language. In this chapter, we''ll get our
    first hands-on experience using Storm with Python. First, you''ll learn about
    a Python library called Petrel, which is necessary for creating topologies in
    Python. Next, we''ll set up our Python/Storm development environment. Then, we''ll
    take a close look at a working Storm topology written in Python. Finally, we''ll
    run the topology and you will learn some key techniques to ease the process of
    developing and debugging topologies. After you complete this chapter, you''ll
    have a good high-level understanding of developing basic Storm topologies. In
    this chapter, we will cover these topics:'

- en: All Python topologies in this book rely on an open source Python library called
    Petrel. If you have prior experience with Storm, you may recall that there is
    a GitHub project called `storm-starter` that includes examples of using Storm
    with various languages (you can find the latest version of `storm-starter` at
    [https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter)).
    The `storm-starter` project includes a module called `storm.py`, which allows
    you to implement Storm topologies in Python. Given the availability of `storm.py`,
    is it really necessary to use another library? While it is certainly possible
    to build topologies using `storm.py`, it lacks some important features. To work
    around those gaps, a developer must use languages and tools that won't be familiar
    to most Python developers. If you are already familiar with these tools and do
    not mind juggling multiple technology stacks as you work with Storm, you may be
    happy with `storm.py`. But most developers who are new to Storm find the `storm.py`
    approach to be overly complex, even overwhelming. Let's discuss the weaknesses
    of `storm.py` in more detail.

- en: In order to run a topology, Storm needs a description of spouts, bolts, and
    streams within it. This description is encoded in a format called **Thrift**.
    The `storm.py` module does not support the creation of this description; the developer
    must create it using another programming language (typically Java or Clojure).

- en: A topology is submitted to Storm in the form of a Java `.jar` file (similar
    to Python `.egg` or `.tar.gz` files). In addition to the topology description,
    a Python topology `.jar` must also include the Python code for the topology. Creating
    a JAR file typically involves using Java development tools such as Ant or Maven.

- en: It is much easier to debug and monitor a topology if it includes logging messages
    to allow tracking of the data that flows through it. If things go wrong in a Python
    topology and the code crashes, it's invaluable to see what the error was and where
    it occurred. The `storm.py` module provides no help in these areas. If a component
    crashes, it simply exits without capturing any information. In my experience,
    this is the most frustrating aspect of working with `storm.py`.

    third-party libraries in a Python virtual environment. Petrel addresses all of
    these limitations of Storm''s built-in Python support, providing a simpler, more

    In a real-world spout, you might be reading from an external data source, such
    as Kafka or Twitter. This spout is just an example, so it generates its own data.
    It simply makes a random choice between one of two sentences.

    down and makes the output easier to read when the topology runs in local mode.
  prefs: []

    When a spout or bolt script is loaded into Storm, Petrel calls the `run()` function
    to create the component and begins processing messages. If your spout or bolt
    needs to do additional initialization, this is a good place for it to do so.

    an API that gives developers real-time access to streams of tweets. On it, messages

- en: Twitter's public API is both powerful and flexible. It has many features for
    both posting and consuming tweets. Our application needs to receive and process
    tweets in real time. Twitter's streaming API was designed to solve this problem.
    In computer science, a *stream* is a sequence of data elements (in this case,
    tweets) made available over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The streaming API is explained in detail at [https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview).
    To use it, an application first creates a connection to Twitter. The connection
    remains open indefinitely to receive tweets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Streaming API offers several ways to choose which tweets your application
    receives. Our topology uses the so-called sample stream, which provides a small
    subset of all tweets arbitrarily chosen by Twitter. The sample stream is intended
    for demos and testing. Production applications generally use one of the other
    stream types. For more information about the available streams, refer to [https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/public).

- en: Creating a Tweepy stream requires the four Twitter connection parameters listed
    earlier. We could hardcode these directly in our spout, but then we'd have to
    change the code if the connection parameters change. Instead, we put this information
    in the `topology.yaml` configuration file. Our spout reads these settings in the
    `initialize()` function. Storm calls this function when a task for this component
    starts up, passing it information about the environment and configuration. Here,
    the `initialize()` function captures the topology configuration in `self.conf`.
    This dictionary includes the `oauth` values.

- en: The rolling word count bolt is similar to the word count bolt in [Chapter 3](ch03.html
    "Chapter 3. Introducing Petrel"), *Introducing Petrel*. The bolt in the earlier
    chapter simply accumulated the word counts indefinitely. This is not good for
    analyzing top words on Twitter, where popular topics can change from one moment
    to the next. Rather, we want counts that reflect the latest information. To do
    this, the rolling word count bolt stores data in time-based buckets. Then, it
    periodically discards buckets that exceed 5 minutes in age. Thus, the word counts
    from this bolt only consider the last 5 minutes of data.

    (15) seconds. In production, the topology will run many instances of this bolt,
    with each of them maintaining the top words for a *subset* of the overall words
    seen. Having many instances of the same component allows the topology to process
    large numbers of tweets and easily keep all the counts in the memory, even if
    the number of distinct words is quite large.

    has a new wrinkle. As described earlier, there is just one instance of this bolt,
    and it uses `globalGrouping()`, so all tuples from `IntermediateRankingsBolt`
    are sent to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may be wondering why the topology needs both an intermediate ranking and
    a total ranking bolt. In order for us to know the top words overall, there needs
    to be a single bolt instance (total rankings) that sees across the entire tweet
    stream. But at high data rates, a single bolt can't possibly keep up with the
    traffic. The intermediate rankings bolt instances "shield" the total rankings
    bolt from this traffic, computing the top words for their slice of the tweet stream.
    This allows the final rankings bolt to compute the most common words overall,
    while consuming only a handful of the overall word counts. Elegant!

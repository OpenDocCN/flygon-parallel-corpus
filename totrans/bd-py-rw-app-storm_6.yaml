  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you're trying to push a lot of data through a topology, raw performance
    is certainly a concern—faster components means that more data can be processed.
    But it's also important to understand the tuple processing performance of individual
    components. This information can be used in two ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first is knowing which components are slower, because this tells you where
    to focus your attention if you are trying to make the code faster. Once you know
    which component (or components) is slow, you can use tools such as the Python
    cProfile module ([http://pymotw.com/2/profile/](http://pymotw.com/2/profile/))
    and the line profiler ([https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler))

- en: In this chapter, you learned some skills that will help make you more productive
    building your own topologies. As you develop spouts or bolts, you can test them
    individually before assembling them into a complete topology and deploying on
    Storm. If you encounter a tricky problem that occurs only while running in Storm,
    you can use Winpdb in addition to (or instead of) log messages. When your code
    is working, you can get insights into which components take most of the time,
    so you can focus on improving performance in those areas. With these skills, you
    are now ready to go out and build your own topologies. Good luck!

- en: In this chapter, we saw how distributed Storm processes running over multiple
    machines can be managed using the supervisord process. There are many options
    available in supervisord, such as `autostart=true`. If we set this option for
    any Storm process, it also increases the reliability of the overall system and
    manages failure of Nimbus.

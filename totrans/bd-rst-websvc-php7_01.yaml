    communication over a network. It is very useful for communication between different
    systems or devices. In our case, we will be using web services to provide an interface
    by which either a mobile application or a web application will be able to communicate
    with a server to get and store data. This will make the client-side application
    separate from the server side logic. And nowadays, SPAs (Single Page Applications)
    and mobile applications need to be stand alone, separate from server side and
    only interacting with server side logic with web services. So definitely web services
    are very much important nowadays. However, web service usage is not limited to
    client side application usage but it is also useful in server to server communication
    where one server acts as a client.

    of concerns". It means that the server and client have separate responsibilities,
    so one is not responsible for the other's duties. For example, the client is not
    responsible for data storage on the server as it is the server's responsibility.
    In the same way, the server doesn't need to know about the user interface. So
    both the server and client perform their tasks and fulfill their own responsibilities
    which makes their work easier. Hence, the server can be more scalable and the
    user interface on the client can be independent and more interactive.

- en: So REST is stateless. To maintain the state, one needs to pass an identifier
    or any other information, to logically group different requests to maintain a
    session in the request. If no such identifier is passed in the request, the server
    will never know if those two requests are from same client.
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，REST是无状态的。为了维护状态，需要传递标识符或任何其他信息，以逻辑上分组不同的请求以在请求中维护会话。如果在请求中没有传递这样的标识符，服务器将永远不知道这两个请求是否来自同一个客户端。
- en: The advantage of statelessness is simplicity. The same requests will not result
    in different responses unless the request parameters are changed. It will return
    different results based on different request parameters not due to some sort of
    state. Even the state depends on requests, as shown in the preceding example.
    So that session identifier is in the request, which can result in a different
    state and, hence, results in a different response.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 无状态性的优势在于简单性。相同的请求不会产生不同的响应，除非请求参数发生了变化。它将根据不同的请求参数返回不同的结果，而不是由于某种状态。即使状态取决于请求，如前面的例子所示。因此，会话标识符在请求中，这可能导致不同的状态，因此导致不同的响应。

    as cache-able or not, so that the client can know whether it should be cached
    or not. If it is correctly defined, it can result in less overhead and better
    performance because the client will not go to the server if it is able to use
    the cached version.
  id: totrans-43

  zh: 这个约束规定RESTful Web服务的响应必须定义自身是否可缓存，以便客户端知道是否应该缓存。如果正确定义，它可以减少开销并提高性能，因为如果能够使用缓存版本，客户端就不会去服务器。

  zh: 实际上，服务器上的资源存储是一种实现，但请求和响应是客户端与之交互的方式，因此它就像是对客户端的接口。客户端可以通过这个接口识别资源。客户端所知道的就是它请求和得到的响应。
- en: For example, a client usually sends a request to the URI and gets a response
    in the form of HTML, JSON, or XML. None of these formats are how the server stores
    data internally in the database or somewhere else on the server. But for a client,
    it is the URI where it will hit and the HTML, JSON, and XML is what it gets.

- en: This is what a resource is for a client, no matter how it is stored on the server.
    And this is the benefit, because no matter if the server's internal logic or representation
    is changed, for the client it will remain the same because the client sends the
    request to the URI and gets a response in the form of HTML, JSON, or XML and not
    how it is stored on the server. This constraint, results in loose coupling of
    resource identification and representation.

  zh: 这是客户端的资源，无论它在服务器上如何存储。这就是好处，因为无论服务器的内部逻辑或表示如何更改，对于客户端来说它都将保持不变，因为客户端将请求发送到URI并以HTML、JSON或XML的形式获得响应，而不是它在服务器上的存储方式。这个约束导致资源标识和表示的松散耦合。

    the HTTP method and URI. This makes things easy to follow, as the API developer
    doesn't need to provide documentation for each and every endpoint related to a
    resource.

  zh: 这个约束规定客户端应该持有足够的信息来修改或删除资源的表示。例如，在基于Web的REST系统中，可以使用HTTP方法和URI对资源执行任何操作。这使得事情变得容易跟踪，因为API开发人员不需要为与资源相关的每个端点提供文档。

    server and client should be stateless be independent of other messages. One message
    doesn't have an impact on other messages. So, it doesn't matter if two messages
    are passed in some particular order or not, as they are independent. The request

    came along as an alternative. A key difference is that SOAP doesn't have some
    particular convention that tells consumers how to access that. SOAP exposes its
    services using WSDL. Consider WSDL as a definition of services that SOAP provides.
    This is how the consumer knows what SOAP based web service provides and how to
    consume them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: REST的一个旧的替代方案是SOAP。事实上，当REST作为一种替代方案出现时，SOAP已经存在。一个关键的区别是SOAP没有告诉消费者如何访问的特定约定。SOAP使用WSDL来公开其服务。将WSDL视为SOAP提供的服务的定义。这就是消费者知道SOAP基于网络服务提供了什么以及如何消费它们的方式。
- en: On the other hand, REST emphasizes on "c**<q>onventions over configurations</q>**".
    If you look at the URL structures and HTTP verbs of RESTful web services as we
    did earlier, there is a fixed convention. For example, if you are at the client
    side and want to create a product, if you know what parameters it will take then
    you can simply create it by sending a `POST` request to `example.com/product`
    and the resource will be created. If you want to list all the products, you can
    use the same URL with a `GET` request. If you get product IDs from the List operation,
    you can simply use them to update or delete a product by using `example.com/product/{product_id}`
    using `PATCH` and `PUT` or `DELETE` respectively. It is that simple to know what
    URL and HTTP method to use to do a type of operation because these are some conventions
    that RESTful web services follow. So, the one on the client end will just follow
    those conventions and will not need large documentations for simple tasks.

  zh: 另一方面，REST强调“约定优于配置”。如果你像我们之前所做的那样看RESTful网络服务的URL结构和HTTP动词，你会发现有一个固定的约定。例如，如果你在客户端并且想要创建一个产品，如果你知道它将需要哪些参数，那么你可以通过向`example.com/product`发送`POST`请求来创建它，资源将被创建。如果你想列出所有产品，你可以使用相同的URL和`GET`请求。如果你从列表操作中获取产品ID，你可以简单地使用它们来通过`example.com/product/{product_id}`分别使用`PATCH`和`PUT`或`DELETE`来更新或删除产品。要知道使用哪种URL和HTTP方法来执行某种操作是如此简单，因为这些是RESTful网络服务遵循的一些约定。因此，客户端端只需遵循这些约定，对于简单的任务就不需要大量的文档。

    internal server error. In case of any problem in the request, the HTTP status
    code is 400 and onwards where 400 status code means a bad request. In case of
    redirection, the response code is 300 and onwards.

- en: To understand RESTful web services, let's consider the case study of a blog
    where we will discuss resources/entities in a blog. We will start to define the
    requirements and endpoints URLs for the blog's resources and then define responses
    that we should have against those requests. So these endpoints and response definitions
    will help us understand how RESTful web services endpoint should look like and
    what the response should be. In the later chapters, we will talk more about the
    implementation of these endpoints, so these definitions will act as an API document
    for the next chapters. However, for simplicity, we will keep it minimal for now
    and later add more attributes to it.

  zh: 为了理解RESTful web服务，让我们以博客为案例研究，在博客中讨论资源/实体。我们将开始定义博客资源的要求和端点URL，然后定义我们应该对这些请求做出怎样的响应。因此，这些端点和响应定义将帮助我们理解RESTful
    web服务端点应该是什么样子，以及响应应该是什么样子。在后面的章节中，我们将更多地讨论这些端点的实现，因此这些定义将作为下一章的API文档。然而，为了简单起见，我们现在将保持最小限度，并在以后添加更多属性。
- en: Although based on HATEOAS, a RESTful web service should return links to the
    next endpoints and there are conventions that tell us about other endpoints but
    the API document is still important. API consumers (client-side developers) and
    API providers (server-side developers) should agree on it so that both can work
    in parallel without waiting for the other. However, in the real world, we don't
    have to write API document for basic CRUD operations.

- en: In this chapter, we understood what a RESTful web service is. We looked at constraints
    that should be fulfilled to be called as a RESTful web service. Then we understood
    that REST is an architecture and it is a way to build stuff and it favors convention
    over configuration. We looked at HTTP verbs (methods) and looked at URL conventions.
    We understood that these are just conventions. HTTP verbs and URLs are used in
    RESTful web services; otherwise it is always up to the developer to provide the
    expected behavior as REST has conventions which are just considered as standard
    but it don't provide any implementation.

    We just considered a case study of a typical blog and took examples of two resources
    of the blog and defined their endpoints with the expected responses. We also looked
    at HTTP response code but we didn't write actual code to implement these RESTful
    web services. We defined these endpoints, so we will see their implementation
    in the next chapters.

    we will look at the features that came in PHP7\. PHP7 does not offer anything
    specific to RESTful web services but we will be utilizing some of the new features
    in PHP7 to write better and clean code to build RESTful web services.

    you can skip [Chapter 2](a9520046-cc27-42d5-bb35-db474dd77a75.xhtml), *PHP7, To
    Code It Better*, and start [Chapter 3](75dfe538-b06c-46b9-a07f-8ac29a158975.xhtml),
    *Creating RESTful Endpoints*, where we will build RESTful web services.

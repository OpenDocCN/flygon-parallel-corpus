    carry out many low level things such as being aware of SQL injection (due to which
    we have to use the prepare statement, then bind values), to perform database-related
    operations. We should use some sort of query builder layer, which can make queries

- en: Although PDO makes it easy to swap one database connection with another, still
    there are some SQL queries which will need to be changed for different databases.
    In fact, it is not only good for changing the DBMS but also, having a sort of
    query builder is time saving because using query builder, we are not always dealing
    with strings to build queries as with query builder we can also use arrays or
    associative arrays to build queries.

    Doing this is easy in `routes.php`, but the actual place where we will need to
    add implementation will be `core/router.php`. It can be done, but we will not
    do that. We don't make components such as routers from scratch, because it is
    not something that is being done for the first time in the world. So how do we
    do it? We can use a router from open source components or packages which are already

- en: The expiration period can be around two hours or less. Although it depends on
    how you want to implement it, a shorter expiration period is more secure. Expiration
    does not mean that the user will need to log in again, instead there will be a
    token refresh endpoint. That will be hit with the last expired token against a
    particular user to get a new token. Please note that last token should be usable
    for refresh token endpoint till a limited time, after that last token shouldn't
    be usable to refresh token. Otherwise, what's the point in expiring a token. Remember
    that there are trade offs between both ways. Refresh token on every request is
    more secure but cause more overhead for server. So it is always up to you that
    which way you prefer in your scenario.

- en: The other way to expire a token is not to expire it by time, but by refreshing
    a token on every request. For example, if a request is sent with one token, the
    server will validate that token, refresh the token, and send a new token in response.
    So the old token will not be usable. The token will be refreshed on every request.
    It can be done in both ways; it is up to you how you prefer it.

  zh: 过期令牌的另一种方法是不通过时间来过期，而是在每次请求时刷新令牌。例如，如果使用一个令牌发送请求，服务器将验证该令牌，刷新令牌，并在响应中发送一个新的令牌。因此，旧令牌将不可用。令牌将在每次请求时刷新。可以用两种方式来实现；这取决于您如何偏好。

  zh: 限制访问令牌的范围也是一个好主意，以避免未经授权的人获得令牌时出现问题。此外，如果向客户端应用程序提供的服务不针对特定用户或访问权限，那么它仍应该具有某种API密钥，以便我们可以确定谁在请求信息。因此，如果有可疑的尝试使用某个API密钥访问API端点，我们可以简单地撤销特定的API密钥，这样它将不再对未来的请求有效。只有当有多个API密钥具有有限的访问级别时才可能实现这一点。

    without login, but they are only intended to be accessible through our application.
    Those endpoints are not public, so we do not want those endpoints to be accessible

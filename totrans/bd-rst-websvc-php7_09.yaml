    service for a simple blog in this book. We took that example to keep things simple
    in terms of business logic so that we can focus on our actual subject in detail.
    This was helpful, but in the real world, things are not that simple and small.
    There are big systems with different parts, which are difficult to maintain. These
    parts are also difficult to debug and scale. Scaling is different from just maintaining
    something and optimizing it for better performance. In scaling, optimization of
    both code and deployment environment matter. Scalability, maintainability, and
    performance have always been challenges that we have faced.

    Fowler的博客上找到了一个定义，非常令人信服。他和James Lewis这样定义它：
- en: <q>The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single
    application as a **suite of small services**, each **running in its own process**
    and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These
    services are **built around business capabilities** and **independently deployable**
    by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a **bare minimum of centralized

  zh: 这似乎很正式，所以让我们深入了解这个定义，并尝试理解微服务架构。
- en: First of all, you should know that in the example, the RESTful web service we
    created for the blog was a monolithic web service. This means everything was in
    the same web service. Everything was together, so it needs to be deployed together
    as one code base. We can use the same monolithic approach for a bigger application
    as well, but that application will start becoming more and more complex and will
    be less scalable.

  zh: 首先，你应该知道，在我们为博客创建的RESTful web服务的例子中，是一个单体式的web服务。这意味着一切都在同一个web服务中。一切都在一起，因此需要一起部署为一个代码库。我们也可以对更大的应用程序使用相同的单体式方法，但该应用程序将变得越来越复杂，可扩展性将会减弱。
- en: As opposed to that, microservices are composed of a lot of small services. Every
    small service is known as a microservice, or we can simply call it a service.
    These services fulfill the purpose of one application, but they are independent
    and very loosely coupled. So, every microservice has a separate code base and
    has a separate database or storage. As each microservice is independent, it can
    be deployed independently, even if we want to deploy on the same server or a different
    one. This means all services may or may not be in the same language or framework.
    It is possible that if one service is in PHP, another can be in Node.js and another
    can be in Python.

  zh: 与此相反，微服务由许多小服务组成。每个小服务被称为微服务，或者我们可以简单地称之为服务。这些服务实现了一个应用程序的目的，但它们是独立的，非常松散耦合的。因此，每个微服务都有一个单独的代码库和一个单独的数据库或存储。由于每个微服务都是独立的，即使我们想要在同一台服务器上或不同的服务器上部署，它也可以独立部署。这意味着所有服务可能是相同的语言或框架，也可能不是。如果一个服务是PHP，另一个可能是Node.js，另一个可能是Python。

    Fine-grained services can result in more effort at the development end and still
    result in bad performance because there are too many things interacting with each

  zh: 同时，确保服务不要过于细粒度也很重要。过于细粒度的服务可能会导致开发工作量增加，同时由于相互交互的事物太多而导致性能不佳，因为它们实际上是相互依赖的。
- en: In an ideal case, those services are always independent of each other. However,
    it is not always possible. Sometimes, there is something that one service needs
    from the other one, and sometimes, two or more services have some common logic.
    So, dependent services interact with each other mostly through HTTP calls, and
    common logic can be in a shared code base across different services. However,
    that is only possible when the same technology is being used in those services.
    Actually, this means that two or more services are depending on common code base.
    So, in theory based on the preceding definition, this is against the microservices
    architecture, but as there is no formal theory or official specification so we
    are considering anything that is happening in real world what is happening in

    want to start with is when we are dividing it into components having single responsibilities,
    we are abiding by the **SRP** (**Single Responsibility Principle**). Single responsibility
    is actually one of the first five Object Oriented Principles, also known as SOLID
    ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
    ). This single responsibility principle, even if it is at architectural level
    or low level, it makes things simple and easy. Here, in the case of microservices,
    separates different components from each other. So, the reason for modifying a
    component will be related to one single functionality. Other components and functionalities
    of the system will work as they were working before. This is how being separated
    and being independent as microservices makes them easier to modify without affecting
    others.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 有几个动机支持微服务。然而，我想要开始的是，当我们将其分成具有单一责任的组件时，我们遵守**SRP**（**单一责任原则**）。单一责任实际上是面向对象原则中的前五个之一，也被称为SOLID（[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))）。这个单一责任原则，无论是在架构层面还是低层面，都使事情变得简单和容易。在微服务的情况下，它将不同的组件分离开来。因此，修改一个组件的原因将与一个单一功能相关。系统的其他组件和功能将像以前一样工作。这就是微服务作为独立的组件和功能使它们更容易修改而不影响其他组件的方式。

  zh: 告诉大家模块化的代码总是更容易维护并且可以轻松调试，这并不是什么新鲜事。您可以轻松调试它，而且还有什么比不仅是模块化而且还部署为独立模块的组件更模块化的呢？因此，我们从微服务中获得了许多优势，这些优势是我们从模块化代码中获得的。
- en: However, there is something to understand. If we are working with the microservices
    architecture from start, application will be modular because we are making services
    separately. However, if we didn't start with microservices and later on, we want
    to convert it to microservices, then first, we need to have modular code and then
    we can use the microservices architecture because if we don't have modules and
    loosely coupled code, we cannot split them in to independent components.

  zh: 然而，有一点需要理解。如果我们从一开始就使用微服务架构，应用程序将是模块化的，因为我们正在分开开发服务。然而，如果我们没有从一开始就使用微服务，而是后来想要将其转换为微服务，那么首先，我们需要有模块化的代码，然后我们才能使用微服务架构，因为如果我们没有模块和松散耦合的代码，我们就无法将它们拆分成独立的组件。
- en: So, in short, motivation here for microservices is simply that we can debug
    modular code and components easily. In the case of maintenance, there will not
    be such a ripple effect if the code is in separate components and other services
    are getting what they need, without worrying about the internal logic of modified

  zh: 总之，微服务的动机很简单，我们可以轻松地调试模块化的代码和组件。在维护的情况下，如果代码在独立的组件中，并且其他服务得到了它们所需的东西，而不用担心修改组件的内部逻辑，那么就不会出现连锁反应。
- en: Actually this is not it; a very important factor in the maintenance stage is
    productivity. In bigger code bases, productivity can be reduced over time, because
    developers need to worry about the whole application. However, in microservices,
    developers in one team doing one particular change don't have to worry about the
    whole application but the code inside that particular service at the time, because
    for that particular change and for the developer working on it, this one microservice
    is the whole application which has a lot less responsibility than the overall
    application. So, that way, productivity during maintenance can be much better
    in microservices than monolithic applications.

  zh: 实际上，这还不是全部；在维护阶段一个非常重要的因素是生产力。在更大的代码库中，随着时间的推移，生产力可能会降低，因为开发人员需要担心整个应用程序。然而，在微服务中，一个团队中的开发人员进行的特定更改不需要担心整个应用程序，而只需要关注那个特定服务内的代码，因为对于那个特定的更改和正在处理它的开发人员来说，这一个微服务就是整个应用程序，其责任远远小于整个应用程序。因此，在维护期间，微服务的生产力可能比单片应用程序要好得多。

    add more small servers or server instances instead of adding all the resources

    to be maintained and it needs more effort. Technology freedom comes with microservices,
    but not without any cost. You have to maintain different server instances using
    different technologies. This will need better infrastructure and people with experience
    of more technologies.
  id: totrans-74
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, you don't always need better infrastructure and people with knowledge
    of all those different technologies. Normally, every team working on different
    services will have its own infrastructure or Dev-ops-related people. However,
    in that case, you need more people because now, you are not sharing Dev-ops or
    infrastructure-related people across different teams. In fact, this is how teams
    are made for microservices. Teams don't have shared resources at-least they shouldn't
    have. Otherwise, you don't get the advantage of parallel working because of independent
    services.
  id: totrans-75

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, infrastructure doesn't only mean server setup, but also deployments,
    monitoring, and logging. So, for that purpose, you can't just use one technology
    and solve the problem on the trade-off of limiting your technology choices. However,
    limiting your technology choices can make it a bit easier for Dev-ops as well.

    integration server. It runs your test cases, and then, if everything works well,
    it deploys on your actual server. For this purpose, you need to have Dev-ops person/people
    who write scripts to automate your deployments. There are several ways to do so.

    independent microservice is being used by the client. A clear reason is that a
    request has to go through less stuff in one small micro-service than passing through
    a big monolithic application.
  id: totrans-79
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this is an ideal case and not all microservices are completely independent
    of each other. They interact with each other and depend on each other. So, if
    one service has to get something from another one, it will most probably need
    a network call, and network calls are expensive. This results in performance problems.
    However, this can be minimized if services are created in a way where dependency
    is minimal. If dependency is not minimal, that means services are not independent
    and in that case we can combine such services and make one independent service.
  id: totrans-80
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another option can be shared code; the code that will be used across different
    services. If two or more services are using the same functionality, then instead
    of having that as another service that different services depend on, we can simply
    make it a shared code that will be part of different services' code base. We will
    not repeat ourselves and will try to make it a module or package that different
    services can use. However, some people think it is bad practice as we will have
    some code shared between different services, which means it is not going to be
    loosely coupled.

  zh: 正如你所看到的，我们说在微服务中调试和维护会更容易。然而，当这些服务之间进行通信并且一个服务的输出影响另一个服务时，这也会成为一个挑战。
- en: 'When we have different services, we need a way for services to communicate
    with each other. Services communicate with each other in two ways: through HTTP
    calls or through messages. Here, by messages we mean using some sort of messaging
    queues such as RabbitMQ and so on. In the case of message passing, it can be very
    difficult if there is some bug or something unexpected is happening. Since it
    is not one service and every service is working based on the previous service''s
    output, it is difficult to know where the problem is.'

    working fine, then it can fail before deployment.

    Many services are interacting and sometimes, there is a problem in the live environment

  zh: 你需要在某个集中的地方收集日志。如果你的日志在一个集中的地方，那么查看它们就会更容易，而不是检查每个服务器实例的日志。
- en: It is also important because you should have logs in an external place other
    than your instances as logs' backup. The reason is that if you replace an instance,
    then you probably want to keep a copy of your logs to utilize while debugging.
    This can be any place either Amazon S3, your DB, or a disk, but you want it to
    be durable and available. If you are on AWS, then you can also use their monitoring
    service named CloudWatch at [https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
  id: totrans-89

    is a log of many services together, will not be that helpful. There will be a

    JSON). One service sends an HTTP request to another service, waits for its response,
    and proceeds after getting the response. Synchronous communication has network
    overheads and have to wait for response, but it is simple to implement and sometimes
    that delay is not a problem. So in such cases, for the sake of simplicity we can

- en: 'For years, I’ve wished that someone would write a book like this. Since their
    publication, I’ve often admired and recommended the Google Site Reliability Engineering
    (SRE) books—so I was thrilled to find that a book focused on security and reliability
    was already underway when I arrived at Google, and am only too happy to contribute
    in a small way to the process. Ever since I began working in the tech industry,
    across organizations of varying sizes, I’ve seen people struggling with the question
    of how security should be organized: Should it be centralized or federated? Independent
    or embedded? Operational or consultative? Technical or governing? The list goes
    on….'

  zh: 多年来，我一直希望有人能写一本像这样的书。自从它们出版以来，我经常钦佩并推荐谷歌的可靠性工程（SRE）书籍，所以当我来到谷歌时，我很高兴地发现一本关注安全和可靠性的书已经在进行中，我也很乐意以一种小小的方式参与其中。自从我开始在技术行业工作以来，跨越各种规模的组织，我看到人们在如何组织安全方面一直在挣扎：它应该是集中的还是联邦的？独立的还是嵌入式的？操作性的还是咨询性的？技术性的还是管理性的？等等……
- en: When [the SRE model](https://oreil.ly/OZvsg), and SRE-like versions of DevOps,
    became popular, I noticed that the problem space SRE tackles exhibits similar
    dynamics to security problems. Some organizations have combined these two disciplines
    into an approach called “DevSecOps.”

  zh: 当SRE模型和类似SRE的DevOps版本变得流行时，我注意到SRE所处理的问题领域表现出与安全问题类似的动态。一些组织已经将这两个学科结合起来，形成了一种称为“DevSecOps”的方法。

    teams. Yet both differ from classic software engineering teams in fundamental
    ways:'

  zh: SRE和安全都对经典软件工程团队有很强的依赖性。然而，它们与经典软件工程团队在根本上有所不同：

    as well as build.

- en: SRE created a role and responsibilities specific to a set of skills, which we
    can see as analogous to the role of security engineer. SRE also created an implementation
    model that connects teams, and this seems to be the next step that the security
    community needs to take. For many years, my colleagues and I have argued that
    security should be a first-class and embedded quality of software. I believe that
    embracing an SRE-inspired approach is a logical step in that direction.

  zh: SRE创建了一个特定技能集的角色和责任，我们可以将其视为安全工程师的角色。SRE还创建了一个连接团队的实施模型，这似乎是安全社区需要采取的下一步。多年来，我和我的同事们一直主张安全应该成为软件的一流和嵌入式质量。我相信采用受SRE启发的方法是朝着这个方向迈出的一个合乎逻辑的步骤。
- en: Since arriving at Google, I’ve learned more about how the SRE model was established
    here, how SRE implements DevOps philosophies, and how SRE and DevOps have evolved.
    Meanwhile, I’ve been translating my IT security experience in the financial services
    industry to the technical and programmatic security capabilities at Google. These
    two sectors are not unrelated, but each has its own history worth understanding.
    At the same time, enterprises are at a critical point where cloud computing, various
    forms of machine learning, and a complicated cybersecurity landscape are together
    determining where an increasingly digital world is going, how quickly it will
    get there, and what risks are involved.

  zh: 自从来到谷歌以来，我更多地了解了SRE模型是如何在这里建立的，SRE如何实施DevOps理念，以及SRE和DevOps是如何发展的。与此同时，我一直在将我在金融服务行业的IT安全经验转化为谷歌的技术和项目安全能力。这两个领域并不无关，但每个领域都有其值得理解的历史。与此同时，企业正处于一个关键时刻，云计算、各种形式的机器学习以及复杂的网络安全格局共同决定着一个日益数字化的世界将走向何方，以及它将以多快的速度到达，以及涉及哪些风险。
- en: As my understanding of the intersection between security and SRE has deepened,
    I’ve become even more certain that it’s important to more thoroughly integrate
    security practices into the full lifecycle of software and data services. The
    nature of the modern hybrid cloud—much of which is based on open source software
    frameworks that offer interconnected data and microservices—makes tightly integrated
    security and resilience capabilities even more important.

  zh: 随着我对安全和SRE交叉领域的理解加深，我越来越确信更彻底地将安全实践整合到软件和数据服务的整个生命周期中是非常重要的。现代混合云的性质——其中大部分基于提供互连数据和微服务的开源软件框架——使得紧密集成的安全和弹性能力变得更加重要。
- en: The operational and organizational approaches to security in large enterprises
    have varied dramatically over the past 20 years. The most prominent instantiations
    include fully centralized chief information security officers and core infrastructure
    operations that encompass firewalls, directory services, proxies, and much more—teams
    that have grown to hundreds or thousands of employees. On the other end of the
    spectrum, federated business information security teams have either the line of
    business or technical expertise required to support or govern a named list of
    functions or business operations. Somewhere in the middle, committees, metrics,
    and regulatory requirements might govern security policies, and embedded Security
    Champions might either play a relationship management role or track issues for
    a named organizational unit. Recently, I’ve seen teams riffing on the SRE model
    by evolving the embedded role into something like a site security engineer, or
    into a specific Agile scrum role for specialist security teams.

  zh: 在过去20年里，大型企业的安全运营和组织方法差异巨大。最突出的实例包括完全集中的首席信息安全官和涵盖防火墙、目录服务、代理等核心基础设施运营团队，这些团队已经发展到数百或数千名员工。在另一端，联邦业务信息安全团队拥有支持或管理一系列功能或业务运营所需的业务线或技术专业知识。在中间某处，委员会、指标和监管要求可能管理安全政策，嵌入式安全冠军可能扮演关系管理角色或跟踪指定组织单位的问题。最近，我看到团队在SRE模型上进行改进，将嵌入式角色演变成类似站点安全工程师的角色，或者成为专门安全团队的敏捷Scrum角色。
- en: 'For good reasons, enterprise security teams have largely focused on confidentiality.
    However, organizations often recognize data integrity and availability to be equally
    important, and address these areas with different teams and different controls.
    The SRE function is a best-in-class approach to reliability. However, it also
    plays a role in the real-time detection of and response to technical issues—including
    security-related attacks on privileged access or sensitive data. Ultimately, while
    engineering teams are often organizationally separated according to specialized
    skill sets, they have a common goal: ensuring the quality and safety of the system
    or application.'

  zh: 出于充分的理由，企业安全团队主要关注保密性。然而，组织通常认识到数据完整性和可用性同样重要，并通过不同的团队和不同的控制措施来解决这些问题。SRE功能是可靠性的最佳实践方法。然而，它也在实时检测和响应技术问题方面发挥作用，包括对特权访问或敏感数据的安全相关攻击。最终，尽管工程团队在组织上根据专业技能集分开，但它们有一个共同的目标：确保系统或应用的质量和安全。
- en: In a world that is becoming more dependent upon technology every year, a book
    about approaches to security and reliability drawn from experiences at Google
    and across the industry can be an important contribution to the evolution of software
    development, systems management, and data protection. As the threat landscape
    evolves, a dynamic and integrated approach to defense is now a basic necessity.
    In my previous roles, I looked for a more formal exploration of these questions;
    I hope that a variety of teams inside and outside of security organizations find
    this discussion useful as approaches and tools evolve. This project has reinforced
    my belief that the topics it covers are worth discussing and promoting in the
    industry—particularly as more organizations adopt DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE, and
    hybrid cloud architectures along with their associated operating models. At a
    minimum, this book is another step in the evolution and enhancement of system
    and data security in an increasingly digital world.

  zh: 在一个每年对技术依赖性越来越强的世界中，一本关于安全和可靠性方法的书籍，从谷歌和整个行业的经验中汲取，可以对软件开发、系统管理和数据保护的演变做出重要贡献。随着威胁形势的演变，动态和综合的防御方法现在已经成为基本必需品。在我之前的角色中，我寻求对这些问题更正式的探讨；我希望安全组织内外的各种团队在方法和工具演变时会发现这次讨论有用。这个项目加强了我对它所涵盖的主题值得在行业中讨论和推广的信念，特别是在越来越多的组织采用DevOps、DevSecOps、SRE和混合云架构以及相关的运营模式的情况下。至少，这本书是在日益数字化的世界中系统和数据安全演变和增强的又一步。

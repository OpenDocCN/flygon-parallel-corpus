  zh: 迈克尔·威尔德帕纳的序言
- en: At their core, both Site Reliability Engineering and Security Engineering are
    concerned with keeping a system usable. Issues like broken releases, capacity
    shortages, and misconfigurations can make a system unusable (at least temporarily).
    Security or privacy incidents that break the trust of users also undermine the
    usefulness of a system. Consequently, system security is top of mind for SREs.

  zh: 在本质上，网站可靠性工程和安全工程都关注保持系统的可用性。诸如破损的发布、容量短缺和错误配置等问题可能使系统无法使用（至少是暂时的）。破坏用户信任的安全或隐私事件也会削弱系统的实用性。因此，系统安全是SRE们首要关注的问题。
- en: On the design level, security has become a highly dynamic property of distributed
    systems. We’ve come a long way from passwordless accounts on early Unix-based
    telephony switches (nobody had a modem to dial into them, or so people thought),
    static username/password combinations, and static firewall rules. These days,
    we instead use time-limited access tokens and high-dimensional risk assessment
    at millions of requests per second. Granular cryptography of data in flight and
    at rest, combined with frequent key rotation, makes key management an additional
    dependency of any networking, processing, or storage system that deals with sensitive
    information. Building and operating these infrastructure security software systems
    requires close collaboration between the original system designers, security engineers,
    and SREs.

  zh: 在设计层面，安全已经成为分布式系统的高度动态属性。我们已经从早期基于Unix的电话交换机上的无密码帐户（没有人有调制解调器拨入它们，或者人们这样认为），静态用户名/密码组合和静态防火墙规则走了很长一段路。如今，我们使用的是有时限的访问令牌和每秒数百万次的高维风险评估。数据在传输和静态时的细粒度加密，再加上频繁的密钥轮换，使密钥管理成为处理敏感信息的任何网络、处理或存储系统的额外依赖。构建和操作这些基础设施安全软件系统需要原始系统设计者、安全工程师和SRE之间的密切合作。
- en: 'The security of distributed systems has an additional, more personal, meaning
    for me. From my university days until I joined Google, I had a side career in
    offensive security with a focus on network penetration testing. I learned a lot
    about the fragility of distributed software systems and the asymmetry between
    system designers and operators versus attackers: the former need to protect against
    all possible attacks, while an attacker needs to find only a single exploitable
    weakness.'

  zh: 分布式系统的安全对我来说有着额外的、更加个人化的意义。从我大学时代直到加入谷歌之前，我在攻击性安全方面有着一段副业生涯，专注于网络渗透测试。我对分布式软件系统的脆弱性以及系统设计者和运营者与攻击者之间的不对称性有了很多了解：前者需要防范所有可能的攻击，而攻击者只需要找到一个可利用的弱点。
- en: Ideally, SRE is involved in both significant design discussions and actual system
    changes. As one of the early SRE Tech Leads of Gmail, I started seeing SREs as
    one of the best lines of defense (and in the case of system changes, quite literally
    the last line of defense) in preventing bad design or bad implementations from
    affecting the security of our systems.

  zh: 理想情况下，SRE参与重要的设计讨论和实际的系统变更。作为Gmail的早期SRE技术负责人之一，我开始看到SRE作为防御的最佳线路之一（在系统变更的情况下，确实是最后一道防线），以防止糟糕的设计或实现影响我们系统的安全。
- en: Google’s two books about SRE—[*Site Reliability Engineering*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do)
    and [*The Site Reliability Workbook*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920132448.do)—relate
    the principles and best practices of SRE, but don’t go into details about the
    intersection of reliability and security. This book fills that gap, and also has
    the space to dive deeper into security-focused topics.

  zh: 谷歌关于SRE的两本书——《网站可靠性工程》和《网站可靠性工作手册》——阐述了SRE的原则和最佳实践，但并未详细讨论可靠性和安全的交集。这本书填补了这一空白，并且还有空间深入探讨安全相关的主题。
- en: For many years at Google, we’ve been pulling aside engineers and giving them
    “the talk”—a conversation about how to responsibly handle the security of our
    systems. But a more formal treatment of how to design and operate secure distributed
    systems is long overdue. In this way, we can better scale this previously informal
    collaboration.

  zh: 多年来，在谷歌，我们一直在挑选工程师并与他们进行“谈话”——关于如何负责地处理我们系统安全的对话。但是，如何设计和操作安全的分布式系统的更正式的处理已经迫在眉睫。通过这种方式，我们可以更好地扩展先前非正式的合作。
- en: Security is at the forefront of finding new classes of attacks and immunizing
    our systems against the varied threats in today’s networked environments, while
    SRE plays a major role in preventing and remediating such issues. There’s simply
    no alternative to pushing for reliability *and* security as integral parts of
    the software development lifecycle.

  zh: 安全是发现新攻击类型并使我们的系统免受当今网络环境中各种威胁的主要前沿，而SRE在预防和纠正此类问题方面发挥着重要作用。在软件开发生命周期中，推动可靠性和安全作为不可或缺的部分是没有替代方案的。

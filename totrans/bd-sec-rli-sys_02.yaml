- en: Can a system ever truly be considered reliable if it isn’t fundamentally secure?
    Or can it be considered secure if it’s unreliable?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Successfully designing, implementing, and maintaining systems requires a commitment
    to the full system lifecycle. This commitment is possible only when security and
    reliability are central elements in the architecture of systems. Yet both are
    often afterthoughts, considered only after an incident occurs, resulting in expensive
    and sometimes difficult improvements.

- en: '[Security by design](https://oreil.ly/-46BV) is increasingly important in a
    world where many products are connected to the internet, and where cloud technologies
    are becoming more prevalent. The more we come to rely on those systems, the more
    reliable they need to be; the more trust we place in their security, the more
    secure they need to be.'

- en: Why We Wrote This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wanted to write a book that focuses on integrating security and reliability
    directly into the software and system lifecycle, both to highlight technologies
    and practices that protect systems and keep them reliable, and to illustrate how
    those practices interact with each other. The aim of this book is to provide insights
    about system design, implementation, and maintenance from practitioners who specialize
    in security and reliability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’d like to explicitly acknowledge that some of the strategies this book recommends
    require infrastructure support that simply may not exist where you’re currently
    working. Where possible, we recommend approaches that can be tailored to organizations
    of any size. However, we felt that it was important to start a conversation about
    how we can all evolve and improve existing security and reliability practices,
    as all the members of our growing and skilled community of professionals can learn
    a lot from one another. We hope other organizations will also be eager to share
    their successes and war stories with the community. As ideas about security and
    reliability evolve, the industry can benefit from a diverse set of implementation
    examples. Security and reliability engineering are still rapidly evolving fields.
    We constantly find conditions and cases that cause us to revise (or in some cases,
    replace) previously firmly held beliefs.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Because security and reliability are everyone’s responsibility, we’re targeting
    a broad audience: people who design, implement, and maintain systems. We’re challenging
    the dividing lines between the traditional professional roles of developers, architects,
    [Site Reliability Engineers (SREs)](https://oreil.ly/EVa7K), systems administrators,
    and security engineers. While we’ll dive deeply into some subjects that might
    be more relevant to experienced engineers, we invite you—the reader—to try on
    different hats as you move through the chapters, imagining yourself in roles you
    (currently) don’t have and thinking about how you could improve your systems.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We argue that everyone should be thinking about the fundamentals of reliability
    and security from the very beginning of the development process, and integrating
    those principles early in the system lifecycle. This is a crucial concept that
    shapes this entire book. There are many lively active discussions in the industry
    about security engineers becoming more like software developers, and SREs and
    software developers becoming more like security engineers.^([1](preface01.html#ch01fn1))
    We invite you to join in the conversation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we say “you” in the book, we mean the reader, independent of a particular
    job or experience level. This book challenges the traditional expectations of
    engineering roles and aims to empower you to be responsible for security and reliability
    throughout the whole product lifecycle. You shouldn’t worry about using all of
    the practices described here in your specific circumstances. Instead, we encourage
    you to return to this book at different stages of your career or throughout the
    evolution of your organization, considering whether ideas that didn’t seem valuable
    at first might be newly meaningful.

- en: A Note About Culture
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Building and adopting the widespread best practices we recommend in this book
    requires a culture that is supportive of such change. We feel it is essential
    that you address the culture of your organization in parallel with the technology
    choices you make to focus on both security and reliability, so that any adjustments
    you make are persistent and resilient. In our opinion, organizations that don’t
    embrace the importance of both security and reliability need to change—and revamping
    the culture of an organization in itself often demands an up-front investment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve woven technical best practices throughout the book and we support them
    with data, but it’s not possible to include data-backed cultural best practices.
    While this book calls out approaches that we think others can adapt or generalize,
    every organization has a distinct and unique culture. We discuss how Google has
    tried to work within its culture, but this may not be directly applicable to your
    organization. Instead, we encourage you to extract your own practical applications
    from the high-level recommendations we’ve included in this book.

    infrastructure is different, so you may need to significantly adapt some of the

    all. We try to present high-level principles and practical solutions that you
    can implement in a way that suits your unique environment.

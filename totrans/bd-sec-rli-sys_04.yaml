    The engineer had no experience responding to failures of the service: the password
    manager was supported on a best-effort basis, and had never suffered an outage

    not open the safe because the combination was stored in the now-offline password
    manager. Fortunately, another colleague in California had memorized the combination

    2015, Google Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) noticed that the end-to-end cryptographic
    integrity checks on a few blocks of data were failing. Because some of the machines
    that processed the data later demonstrated evidence of uncorrectable memory errors,
    the SREs decided to write software that exhaustively computed the integrity check
    for every version of the data with a single-bit flip (a 0 changed to a 1, or vice
    versa). That way, they could see if one of the results matched the value of the
    original integrity check. All errors indeed turned out to be single-bit flips,
    and the SREs recovered all the data. Interestingly, this was an instance of a
    security technique coming to the rescue during a reliability incident. (Google’s
    storage systems also use noncryptographic end-to-end integrity checks, but other

    the areas of reliability and security. From a victim’s point of view, a malicious
    attack may be indistinguishable from a design flaw or a legitimate spike in traffic.

    They also require ongoing attention and testing throughout the entire system lifecycle,
    because it is easy for system changes to inadvertently affect them. In a complex
    system, reliability and security properties are often determined by the interaction
    of many components, and an innocuous-looking update to one component may end up
    affecting the reliability or security of the entire system in a way that may not

    use risk-based approaches to estimate the costs of negative events, as well as
    the up-front and opportunity costs of preventing these events. However, you should

    You can reason about the reliability of a composition of systems and plan engineering
    work according to desired error budgets,^([1](ch01.html#ch01fn2)) at least in
    part because you can assume independence of failures across the individual components.
    The security of such a composition is more difficult to assess. Analyzing a system’s
    design and implementation can afford some level of assurance. Adversarial testing—simulated
    attacks typically performed from the perspective of a defined adversary—can also
    be used to evaluate a system’s resistance to particular kinds of attacks, the
    effectiveness of attack detection mechanisms, and the potential consequences of

    help responders mitigate symptoms quickly and reduce mean time to repair (MTTR).

    library provides [one notorious example](https://oreil.ly/OIX0b) of a major failure
    caused by a small change. An open source developer noticed that Valgrind, a standard
    tool for debugging memory problems, was reporting warnings about memory used prior
    to initialization. To eliminate the warnings, the developer removed two lines
    of code. Unfortunately, this caused OpenSSL’s pseudo-random number generator to
    only be seeded with a process ID, which on Debian at the time defaulted to a number
    between 1 and 32,768\. Brute force could then easily break cryptographic keys.

    outage. Systems should be designed to be resilient under adverse or unexpected
    circumstances. From the reliability perspective, such circumstances are often
    caused by unexpectedly high load or component failures. Load is a function of
    the volume and the average cost of requests to the system, so you can achieve
    resilience by shedding some of the incoming load (processing less) or reducing
    the processing cost for each request (processing more cheaply). To address component
    failures, system design should incorporate redundancy and distinct failure domains
    so that you can limit the impact of failures by rerouting requests. [Chapter 8](ch08.html#design_for_resilience)

    sufficiently complex, you cannot easily demonstrate that the entire system is
    immune to compromise. You can address this problem in part using defense in depth
    and distinct failure domains. *Defense in depth* is the application of multiple,
    sometimes redundant, defense mechanisms. *Distinct failure domains* limit the
    “blast radius” of a failure and therefore also increase reliability. A good system
    design limits an adversary’s ability to exploit a compromised host or stolen credentials
    in order to move laterally or to escalate privilege and affect other parts of
    the system.
  id: totrans-43

    or restricting the scope of credentials. For example, Google’s internal infrastructure

    data if an attacker gains physical access to a storage device.

    potential abuse vectors than an external attacker who steals an employee’s credentials
    for the first time, the two cases often don’t differ much in practice. The *principle
    of least privilege* can mitigate insider threats. It dictates that a user should
    have the minimal set of privileges required to perform their job at a given time.

    negotiate long intervals with little activity. During these times, teams need
    to keep individuals’ skills and motivation sharp and improve processes and infrastructure
    in preparation for the next emergency. Google’s [Disaster Recovery Testing program
    (DiRT)](https://oreil.ly/hoBK3) regularly simulates various internal system failures
    and forces teams to cope with these types of scenarios. Frequent offensive security
    exercises test our defenses and help identify new vulnerabilities. Google employs
    IMAG even for small incidents, which further prompts us to regularly exercise
    emergency tools and processes.

- en: 'Recovering from a security failure often requires patching systems to fix a
    vulnerability. Intuitively, you want that process to happen as quickly as possible,
    using mechanisms that are exercised regularly and are therefore decently reliable.
    However, the capability to push changes quickly is a double-edged sword: while
    this capability can help close vulnerabilities quickly, it can also introduce
    bugs or performance issues that cause a lot of damage. The pressure to push patches
    quickly is greater if the vulnerability is widely known or severe. The choice
    of whether to push fixes slowly—and therefore to have more assurance that there
    are no inadvertent side effects, but risk that the vulnerability will be exploited—or
    to do so quickly ultimately comes down to a risk assessment and a business decision.
    For example, it may be acceptable to lose some performance or increase resource
    usage to fix a severe vulnerability.'

- en: Choices like this underscore the need for reliable recovery mechanisms that
    allow us to roll out necessary changes and updates quickly without compromising
    reliability, and that also catch potential problems before they cause a widespread
    outage. For example, a robust fleet recovery system needs to have a reliable representation
    of every machine’s current and desired state, and also needs to provide backstops
    to ensure that state is never rolled back to an obsolete or unsafe version. [Chapter 9](ch09.html#design_for_recovery)
    covers this and many other approaches, and [Chapter 18](ch18.html#oneeight_recovery_and_aftermath)
    discusses how to actually recover systems once an event has occurred.

- en: Security and reliability have a lot in common—both are inherent properties of
    all information systems that are tempting to initially sacrifice in the name of
    velocity, but costly to fix after the fact. This book aims to help you address
    inevitable challenges related to security and reliability early on, as your systems
    evolve and grow. Alongside engineering efforts, each organization has to understand
    the roles and responsibilities (see [Chapter 20](ch20.html#twozero_understanding_roles_and_respons))
    that contribute to building a culture of security and reliability ([Chapter 21](ch21.html#twoone_building_a_culture_of_security_a))
    in order to persist sustainable practices. By sharing our experiences and lessons
    learned, we hope to enable you to avoid paying a bigger price further down the
    road by adopting some of the principles described here sufficiently early in the
    system lifecycle.

  zh: 安全性和可靠性有很多共同点——它们都是所有信息系统固有的属性，一开始很容易在速度的名义下牺牲，但事后修复却代价高昂。本书旨在帮助您在系统发展和成长过程中及早解决与安全性和可靠性相关的不可避免的挑战。除了工程努力外，每个组织都必须了解有助于建立安全性和可靠性文化的角色和责任（参见[第20章](ch20.html#twozero_understanding_roles_and_respons)），以持续实践。通过分享我们的经验和教训，我们希望能够使您在系统生命周期的早期采纳本书中描述的一些原则，从而避免在未来付出更大的代价。
- en: We wrote this book with a broad audience in mind, with the goal that you will
    find it relevant regardless of the stage or scope of your project. While reading
    it, keep the risk profile of your project in mind—operating a stock exchange or
    a communication platform for dissidents has a drastically different risk profile
    than running a website for an animal sanctuary. The next chapter discusses the
    classes of adversaries and their possible motivations in detail.

    the SREs decided to write software that exhaustively computed the integrity check
    for every version of the data with a single-bit flip (a 0 changed to a 1, or vice
    versa). That way, they could see if one of the results matched the value of the
    original integrity check. All errors indeed turned out to be single-bit flips,
    and the SREs recovered all the data. Interestingly, this was an instance of a
    security technique coming to the rescue during a reliability incident. (Google’s

  zh: 当然，内存利用问题不应该导致全球服务中断。系统应该被设计成在不利或意外情况下具有弹性。从可靠性的角度来看，这些情况通常是由意外高负载或组件故障引起的。负载是系统请求的数量和平均成本的函数，因此你可以通过减少一部分传入负载（处理更少）或减少每个请求的处理成本（更便宜地处理）来实现弹性。为了解决组件故障，系统设计应该包括冗余和不同的故障域，这样你就可以通过重新路由请求来限制故障的影响。[第8章](ch08.html#design_for_resilience)进一步讨论了这些话题，[第10章](ch10.html#mitigating_denial_of_service_attacks)则深入探讨了特定的DoS缓解措施。
- en: However resilient a system’s individual components might be, once it becomes
    sufficiently complex, you cannot easily demonstrate that the entire system is
    immune to compromise. You can address this problem in part using defense in depth
    and distinct failure domains. *Defense in depth* is the application of multiple,
    sometimes redundant, defense mechanisms. *Distinct failure domains* limit the
    “blast radius” of a failure and therefore also increase reliability. A good system
    design limits an adversary’s ability to exploit a compromised host or stolen credentials
    in order to move laterally or to escalate privilege and affect other parts of
    the system.

  zh: 然而，无论系统的个别组件有多么具有弹性，一旦它变得足够复杂，你就无法轻易证明整个系统对妥协是免疫的。你可以部分地通过深度防御和不同的故障域来解决这个问题。*深度防御*是应用多种，有时是冗余的防御机制。*不同的故障域*限制了故障的“爆炸半径”，因此也增加了可靠性。一个良好的系统设计限制了对手利用受损主机或被盗凭证进行横向移动或提升特权并影响系统其他部分的能力。
- en: You can implement distinct failure domains by compartmentalizing permissions
    or restricting the scope of credentials. For example, Google’s internal infrastructure
    supports credentials that are explicitly scoped to a geographic region. These
    types of features can limit the ability of an attacker who compromises a server
    in one region to move laterally to servers in other regions.

- en: Employing independent encryption layers for sensitive data is another common
    mechanism for defense in depth. For example, even though disks provide device-level
    encryption, it’s often a good idea to also encrypt the data at the application
    layer. This way, even a flawed implementation of an encryption algorithm in a
    drive controller won’t be sufficient to compromise the confidentiality of protected
    data if an attacker gains physical access to a storage device.

- en: While the examples cited so far hinge on external attackers, you must also consider
    potential threats from malicious insiders. Although an insider may know more about
    potential abuse vectors than an external attacker who steals an employee’s credentials
    for the first time, the two cases often don’t differ much in practice. The *principle
    of least privilege* can mitigate insider threats. It dictates that a user should
    have the minimal set of privileges required to perform their job at a given time.
    For example, mechanisms like Unix’s `sudo` support fine-grained policies that
    specify which users can run which commands as which role.

- en: At Google, we also use multi-party authorization to ensure that sensitive operations
    are reviewed and approved by specific sets of employees. This multi-party mechanism
    both protects against malicious insiders and reduces the risk of innocent human
    error, a common cause of reliability failures. Least privilege and multi-party
    authorization are not new ideas—they have been employed in many noncomputing scenarios,

    inputs, or specialized tests to ensure that cryptographic libraries aren’t leaking
    information, testing plays a critical role in gaining assurance that the system

- en: Finally, some approaches to actually deploying code (see [Chapter 14](ch14.html#onefour_deploying_code))
    can limit security and reliability risk. For example, canaries and slow rollouts
    can prevent you from breaking the system for all users simultaneously. Similarly,

    are no inadvertent side effects, but risk that the vulnerability will be exploited—or

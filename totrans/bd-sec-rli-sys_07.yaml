- en: In general, proxies provide a way to address new reliability and security requirements
    without requiring substantial changes to deployed systems. Rather than modifying
    an existing system, you can simply use a proxy to route connections that would
    have otherwise gone directly to the system. The proxy can also include controls
    to meet your new security and reliability requirements. In this case study, we
    examine a set of *safe proxies* we use at Google to limit the ability of privileged
    administrators to accidentally or maliciously cause issues in our production environment.

    the state of physical servers, virtual machines, or particular applications. At
    Google, we use safe proxies to review, approve, and run risky commands without
    establishing an SSH connection to systems. Using these proxies, we can grant fine-grained
    access to debug issues or can rate limit machine restarts. Safe proxies represent
    a single entry point between networks and are key instruments that enable us to

- en: In the safe proxy model, displayed in [Figure 3-1](#safe_proxy), instead of
    talking to the target system directly, clients talk to the proxy. At Google, we
    enforce this behavior by restricting the target system to accept only calls from
    the proxy through a configuration. This configuration specifies which application-layer
    remote procedure calls (RPCs) can be executed by which client roles through access
    control lists (ACLs). After checking the access permissions, the proxy sends the
    request to be executed via the RPC to the target systems. Typically, each target
    system has an application-layer program that receives the request and executes
    it directly on the system. The proxy logs all requests and commands issued by
    the systems it interacts with.

    To reduce friction imposed by the proxy, we work closely with engineers to make

    capabilities related to access control, the interfaces exposed by the proxy should
    use the same external APIs as the target system. As a result, the proxy doesn’t
    affect the overall user experience. Assuming the safe proxy is transparent, it
    can simply forward traffic after performing some pre- and postprocessing for validation
    and logging. The next section discusses one specific instantiation of a safe proxy
    that we use at Google.

- en: 'Googlers perform the majority of administrative operations using [command-line
    interface (CLI)](https://oreil.ly/7qk8Q) tools. Some of these tools are potentially
    dangerous—for example, certain tools can turn off a server. If such a tool specifies
    an incorrect scope selector, a command-line invocation can accidentally stop several
    service frontends, resulting in an outage. It would be difficult and expensive
    to track every CLI tool, ensure that it performs centralized logging, and make
    certain that sensitive actions have further protections. To address this issue,
    Google created a *Tool Proxy*: a binary that exposes a generic RPC method that
    internally executes the specified command line through a fork and exec. All invocations
    are controlled through a policy, logged for auditing, and have the ability to
    require MPA.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using safe proxies is one way to add logging and multi-party authorization to
    a system. Proxies can thus help make your systems more secure and more reliable.
    This approach can be a cost-effective option for an existing system, but will
    be much more resilient if paired with other design principles described in [Part II](part02.html#designing_systems).
    As we discuss in [Chapter 4](ch04.html#design_tradeoffs), if you’re starting a
    new project, you should ideally build your system architecture using frameworks
    that integrate with logging and access control modules.

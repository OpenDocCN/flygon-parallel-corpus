    is down or unreachable via the network. The significance of this risk depends

    over. This redundancy introduces cost and complexity—the two payment providers
    most likely have different APIs, so you must design your system to be able to
    talk to both, along with all the additional engineering and operational costs,
    plus increased exposure to bugs or security compromises.

    during a payment service outage.
  prefs: []

    may introduce its own failure modes. If the message queue is not designed to be
    reliable (for example, it stores data in volatile memory only), you can lose transactions—a
    new risk surface. More generally, subsystems that are exercised only in rare and
    exceptional circumstances can harbor hidden bugs and reliability issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could choose to use a more reliable message queue implementation. This likely
    involves either an in-memory storage system that is distributed across multiple
    physical locations, again introducing complexity, or storage on persistent disk.
    Storing the data on disk, even if only in exceptional scenarios, reintroduces
    the concerns about storing sensitive data (risk of compromise, compliance considerations,
    etc.) that you were trying to avoid in the first place. In particular, some payment
    data is never even allowed to hit disk, which makes a retry queue that relies
    on persistent storage difficult to apply in this scenario.

    and by being prepared to quickly deploy updated versions of it (see [Chapter 7](ch07.html#design_for_a_changing_landscape)).
    You can largely avoid this concern by using a vendor that does not require you
    to link a proprietary library into your service (see [Chapter 6](ch06.html#design_for_understandability)).

    A vulnerability in that code or a compromise of the server that’s serving that

    or sandboxed iframe. However, this tactic means that you need a secure cross-origin

    types—a practice that drastically reduces the likelihood of concurrency bugs.

    We’re now approximately 50 years into the internet’s history, and significant

    still a substantial fraction of web traffic that does not use HTTPS.^([14](ch04.html#ch04fn14))

    this case from outside the security and reliability realm), consider [Agile development
    processes](https://oreil.ly/upg-w). A primary goal of Agile development workflows
    is to increase development and deployment velocity—in particular, to reduce the
    latency between feature specification and deployment. However, Agile workflows
    typically rely on reasonably mature unit and integration testing practices and
    a solid continuous integration infrastructure, which require an up-front investment
    to establish, in exchange for long-term benefits to velocity and stability.

    all else—you can develop the first iteration of your web app without tests, and
    with a release process that amounts to copying tarballs to production hosts. You’ll
    probably get your first demo out relatively quickly, but by your third release,
    your project will quite possibly be behind schedule and saddled with technical
    debt.

    in a mature continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow and
    infrastructure supports frequent production releases with a managed and acceptable
    reliability risk (see [Chapter 7](ch07.html#design_for_a_changing_landscape)).
    But setting up such a workflow requires some up-front investment—for example,
    you will need the following:'

    and it requires only incremental effort by developers to maintain good test coverage
    and “green builds” on an ongoing basis. In contrast, a development workflow with
    poor test automation, reliance on manual steps in deployment, and long release
    cycles tends to eventually bog down a project as it grows in complexity. At that
    point, retrofitting test and release automation tends to require a lot of work
    all at once and might slow down your project even more. Furthermore, tests retrofitted
    to a mature system can sometimes fall into the trap of exercising the current
    buggy behavior more than the correct, intended behavior.

    organizations can enjoy even more benefits of scale, as you can amortize the cost
    across many projects—an individual project’s investment then boils down to a commitment
    to use centrally maintained frameworks and workflows.

- en: When it comes to making security-focused design choices that contribute to sustained
    velocity, we recommend choosing a framework and workflow that provide secure-by-construction
    defense against relevant classes of vulnerabilities. This choice can drastically
    reduce, or even eliminate, the risk of introducing such vulnerabilities during
    ongoing development and maintenance of your application’s codebase (see Chapters
    [6](ch06.html#design_for_understandability) and [12](ch12.html#writing_code)).
    This commitment generally doesn’t involve significant up-front investment—rather,
    it entails an incremental and typically modest ongoing effort to adhere to the
    framework’s constraints. In return, you drastically reduce your risk of unplanned
    system outages or security response fire drills throwing deployment schedules
    into disarray. Additionally, your release-time security and production readiness
    reviews are much more likely to go smoothly.

- en: It’s not easy to design and build secure and reliable systems, especially since
    security and reliability are primarily emergent properties of the entire development
    and operations workflow. This undertaking involves thinking about a lot of rather
    complex topics, many of which at first don’t seem all that related to addressing
    the primary feature requirements of your service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Your design process will involve numerous tradeoffs between security, reliability,
    and feature requirements. In many cases, these tradeoffs will at first appear
    to be in direct conflict. It might seem tempting to avoid these issues in the
    early stages of a project and “deal with them later”—but doing so often comes
    at significant cost and risk to your project: once your service is live, reliability
    and security are not optional. If your service is down, you may lose business;
    and if your service is compromised, responding will require all hands on deck.
    But with good planning and careful design, it is often possible to satisfy all
    three of these aspects. What’s more, you can do so with modest additional up-front
    cost, and often with a reduced total engineering effort over the lifetime of the
    system.'

- en: Even though it’s impossible to plan for every scenario that might disrupt your
    organization, the first steps toward a comprehensive disaster planning strategy,
    as discussed in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#onesix_disaster_planning), are pragmatic
    and approachable. They include setting up an incident response team, prestaging
    your systems and people before an incident, and testing your systems and response
    plans—preparation steps that will also help equip you for crisis management, the
    subject of [Chapter 17](ch17.html#oneseven_crisis_management). When dealing with
    a security crisis, people with a variety of skills and roles will need to be able
    to collaborate and communicate effectively to keep your systems running.

    and deal with the aftermath, as discussed in [Chapter 18](ch18.html#oneeight_recovery_and_aftermath).
    Some up-front planning during these stages will also help you to mount a thorough
    response, and learn from what happened to prevent reoccurrence.

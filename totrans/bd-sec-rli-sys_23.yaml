    “There are only two types of companies: those that know they’ve been compromised,

    well your organization prepares, and also how well you respond. To achieve a mature
    security posture, your organization needs to institute and practice an incident
    response (IR) capability, as discussed in the previous chapter.'

    face new and difficult challenges. As the security industry trends toward greater
    transparency^([1](ch17.html#ch17fn1)) and a need for increased openness with users,
    this expectation poses a unique challenge for any IR team accustomed to operating
    away from the spotlight of public attention. Additionally, regulations like the
    EU’s [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eugdpr.org) and service
    contracts with security-conscious customers continually push the boundaries of
    how quickly investigations must begin, progress, and complete. Today, it’s not

    relatively few incidents should turn into crises. Once an escalation occurs, a
    responder’s first step in assessing the escalation is *triage*—using the knowledge
    and information available to them to make educated and informed assumptions about
    the severity and potential consequences of the incident.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Triage is a well-established skill in the emergency medical community. An emergency
    medical technician (EMT) arriving on the scene of a vehicle accident will first
    make sure there are no immediate risks of further injury to anyone at the scene,
    and then perform triage. For example, if a bus has collided with a car, a few
    pieces of information are already logically available. The people in the car may
    have sustained serious injuries, because a collision with a heavy bus can inflict
    a great deal of damage. A bus can hold many passengers, so there may be multiple
    injuries to passengers. It’s unlikely that any dangerous chemicals are present,
    because neither vehicle would typically carry them. Within the first minute of
    arriving, the EMT knows that they’ll need to call for more ambulances, possibly
    alert a critical care unit, and call the fire department to free any trapped occupants
    from the smaller vehicle. They probably don’t need a hazardous materials cleanup
    crew.

    Not only does running risk making the problem worse by increasing the likelihood
    of an accident on the scene, it also instills a sense of panic in the responder

- en: Although the SRE and security teams at Google perform incident management similarly,
    there is a difference between beginning a crisis management response for a security
    incident and for a reliability incident such as an outage. When an outage occurs,
    the on-call SRE prepares to step into action. Their goal is to quickly find the
    errors and fix them to restore the system to a good state. Most importantly, the
    system is not conscious of its actions and won’t resist being fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    taken by the target organization and work against the responders as they try to
    fix things. It can be catastrophic to attempt to fix the system without first
    completing a full investigation. Because typical SRE work doesn’t carry that risk,
    an SRE’s usual response is to fix the system first and then document what they
    learned from the failure. For example, if an engineer submits a change list (CL)
    that breaks production, an SRE might take immediate action to revert the CL, making
    the problem go away. Once the problem is fixed, the SRE will begin investigating
    what happened. A security response instead requires the team to complete a full
    investigation into what happened prior to attempting to correct things.

    on a formal process called the [Incident Command System (ICS)](https://oreil.ly/4cLxY),
    which is used by fire, rescue, and police agencies around the world. Like ICS,
    IMAG is a flexible response framework that is lightweight enough to manage small
    incidents, but capable of expanding to encompass large and wide-ranging issues.
    Our IMAG program is tasked with formalizing processes to ensure maximum success
    in three key areas of incident handling: command, control, and communications.'

    this by issuing a declaration: “Our team is declaring an incident involving *X*,
    and I am the incident commander (IC).” Explicitly saying “this is an incident”
    may seem simple and perhaps unnecessary, but being explicit in order to avoid
    misunderstandings is a core principle of both command and communications. Beginning
    your incident with a declaration is the first step in aligning everyone’s expectations.
    Incidents are complex and unusual, involve high amounts of tension, and happen
    at high speed. Those involved need to focus. Executives should be notified that
    teams might ignore or bypass normal processes until the incident is contained.'

    of the incident. The IC directs the response and ensures people are moving forward
    toward specific goals at all times, so that the chaos and uncertainty around a

    their leads must constantly maintain excellent *communications* with everyone

    Staff fatigue isn’t just a matter of treating your team kindly; fatigue can cripple

    or assume a common frame of reference that isn’t actually common.

    is mitigated.’’ To the product team, this may mean that as soon as the attacker’s
    tools are deleted, the system is safe to use. To the security team, this may mean
    that the system isn’t safe to use until a complete investigation has concluded
    that the attacker is no longer able to exist in, or return to, the environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you find yourself handling an incident, as a rule of thumb, it’s helpful
    to always *be explicit and overcommunicate*. Explain what you mean when you ask
    for something or set an expectation, even if you think the other person ought
    to know what you mean. In the example from the previous paragraph, it couldn’t
    hurt to say, “We can turn the service back on when we are confident that all paths
    back in have been fixed, and that the attacker is no longer able to access our
    systems.” Keep in mind that the responsibility of communicating usually belongs
    to the communicator—only they can make sure the people they’re communicating with
    receive the intended message.

    give advice in a stressful situation but aren’t feeling confident, they often
    tend to add qualifiers to their statements. Avoiding expressing certainty about
    an uncertain situation by saying something like “We’re pretty sure we found all
    the malware” might feel safer, but hedging often muddies the situation and leads
    to uncertainty among decision makers. Again, being explicit and overcommunicating
    is the best remedy here. If your IC asks if you’ve identified all the attacker’s
    tools, “We’re pretty sure” is a weak answer. It would be better to answer, “We
    are sure about our servers, NAS, email, and file shares, but aren’t feeling confident
    about our hosted systems because we have less log visibility there.”

    hypothetical response to a compromise that an organization of any size might encounter.
    Consider a scenario where an engineer discovers that a service account they don’t
    recognize has been added to a cloud project they haven’t seen before. At noon,
    they escalate their concerns to the security team. After a preliminary investigation,
    the security team determines that an engineer’s account has likely been compromised.
    Using the advice and best practices presented earlier, let’s walk through how
    you might respond to such a compromise from beginning to end.

    the security team’s suspicions are correct that the engineer’s account is compromised.
    An attacker using privileged access to view sensitive internal information and/or
    user data would be a serious security breach, so you declare an incident.'

    legal, etc.—need to know an incident is in progress. If the attacker compromised
    your organization’s infrastructure, emailing or chatting with these people may
    be risky. Follow operational security best practices. Suppose your contingency
    plan calls for using an organization credit card to register a business account
    in a cloud-based environment not associated with your organization, and to create
    accounts for each person involved in the incident. To create and connect to this
    environment, you use freshly rebuilt laptops not connected to your organization’s
    management infrastructure.
  prefs: []

    advise them on how to obtain a secure laptop and a cloud account so they can participate
    via email and chats. Since all the current responders are local to the office,
    you use a nearby meeting room to discuss the particulars of the incident.

- en: As the IC, you need to assign engineers to investigate, so you ask an engineer
    on the security team with forensics experience to be the operations lead. Your
    new OL starts their forensic investigation immediately and recruits other engineers
    as needed. They begin by collecting logs from the cloud environment, focusing
    on the time period when the service account credentials in question were added.
    After confirming that the credentials were added by the engineer’s account during
    a time period when the engineer was definitely out of the office, the forensics
    team concludes that the account has been compromised.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The forensics team now pivots from investigating only the suspect account to
    investigating all other activities around the time the account was added. The
    team decides to collect all the system logs relating to the compromised account,
    as well as that engineer’s laptop and workstation. The team determines that this
    investigation could take a single analyst quite some time, so they decide to add
    more staff and distribute the effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your organization doesn’t have a large security team, so you don’t have enough
    skilled forensic analysts to adequately distribute the forensic task. However,
    you do have system administrators who understand their systems well and who can
    help analyze logs. You decide to assign these sysadmins to the forensics team.
    Your OL contacts them via email with a request to “discuss a few things” over
    a phone call, and briefs them fully during that call. The OL asks the sysadmins
    to collect all logs related to the compromised account from any system in the
    organization, while the forensics team analyzes the laptop and desktop.

    your team can continue working. As the IC, you correctly anticipate that your
    team will become fatigued and start to make mistakes before they can resolve the
    incident, so you need to come up with a handover or continuity plan. You notify
    your team that they have four hours to complete as much analysis of the logs and
    hosts as possible. During this time, you keep leadership and legal up to date
    and check in with the OL to see if their team needs additional help.

    a persistent remote connection.'

    work at this pace is risky, and that the incident will require a lot more effort.
    You decide to hand off some of the work. While your organization doesn’t have
    a full security team outside of the main San Francisco office, you have an engineering
    office in London with some senior staff.

    you’ve learned so far. After receiving ownership rights on all the incident-related
    documentation and making sure that the London team understands the next step,
    the London IC acknowledges that they are in charge until 9:00 PST the next morning.
    The San Francisco team is relieved and sent home to rest. Overnight, the London
    team continues the investigation, focusing on analyzing the backdoor scripts and
    actions performed by the attacker.

    sync. Overnight, the London team made lots of progress. They determined that the
    script run on the compromised workstation installed a simple backdoor, enabling
    the attacker to log in from a remote machine and start looking around the system.
    Noticing that the engineer’s shell history included logins to cloud service accounts,
    the adversary took advantage of the saved credentials and added their own service
    account key to the list of administrative tokens.
  prefs: []

- en: After doing so, they took no further action on the workstation. Instead, cloud
    service logs show that the attacker interacted directly with the service APIs.
    They uploaded a new machine image and launched dozens of copies of that virtual
    machine in a new cloud project. The London team hasn’t yet analyzed any of the
    running images, but they audited all credentials in all existing projects and
    confirmed that the malicious service account and API tokens they know about are
    the only credentials that can’t be verified as legitimate.

    mitigate the attack. You choose a colleague who is a strong technical writer to
    be the communications lead (CL). You ask one of the system admins who isn’t working
    on forensics to become the remediation lead (RL).

    much faster when you know the full details.

    been affected by the attacker, along with proposals for how to clean up each resource.
    Even if you know that the engineer’s password wasn’t exposed in the initial phishing
    email, you’ll need to change their account credentials. To be on the safe side,
    you decide to guard against backdoors that you haven’t yet found but that may
    appear later. You make a copy of the engineer’s important data and then erase
    their home directory, creating a new one on a freshly installed workstation.

    any production data—to everyone’s great relief! The additional VMs the attacker
    launched appear to be a swarm of coin mining servers that mine digital currency
    and direct the funds to the attacker’s virtual wallet. Your RL notes that you
    can delete these machines, or you can snapshot and archive the machines if you
    wish to report the incident to law enforcement later on. You can also delete the
    project the machines were created in.

    and confirmed that the attacker didn’t touch any sensitive data. Fortunately,
    this was an opportunistic coin mining exercise and the attacker wasn’t interested
    in any of your data—just a lot of compute capability on someone else’s bill. Your
    team decides that it’s time to execute your remediation plan. After checking in
    with legal and leadership to ensure that the decision to close out the incident
    has their approval, you signal the team that it’s time to act.

    from the remediation plan and completes them as quickly as possible, ensuring
    that the attacker is shut off quickly and completely. They then spend the rest
    of the afternoon writing down their observations for a postmortem. Finally, you
    (the IC) hold an outbrief, where everyone on the team has the opportunity to discuss
    how the incident went. You clearly communicate that the incident is closed and
    no longer requires an emergency response. Your last task before everyone goes
    home to rest is to brief the London team so they also know that the incident is
    completed.

- en: Incident management, when scaled, becomes its own art that is distinct and separate
    from general project management and smaller incident response work. By focusing
    on processes, tools, and proper organizational structures, it’s possible to staff
    a team that can effectively respond to any crisis at the speed today’s market
    requires. Whether you’re a small organization whose engineers and core team become
    a temporary response team as needed, a giant-scale organization with response
    teams across the globe, or anything in between, you can apply the best practices
    described in this chapter to effectively and efficiently respond to a security
    compromise. Parallelizing your incident response and forensic work and professionally
    managing the team using ICS/IMAG will help you respond scalably and reliably to
    any incidents that arise.

- en: 'Security incidents are inevitable. A common maxim in the industry states that
    “There are only two types of companies: those that know they’ve been compromised,
    and those that don’t know.” The outcome of a security incident depends upon how
    well your organization prepares, and also how well you respond. To achieve a mature
    security posture, your organization needs to institute and practice an incident
    response (IR) capability, as discussed in the previous chapter.'

- en: In addition to the familiar pressures of ensuring that unauthorized parties
    can’t access your systems and that your data stays where it should, IR teams today
    face new and difficult challenges. As the security industry trends toward greater
    transparency^([1](ch17.html#ch17fn1)) and a need for increased openness with users,
    this expectation poses a unique challenge for any IR team accustomed to operating
    away from the spotlight of public attention. Additionally, regulations like the
    EU’s [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eugdpr.org) and service
    contracts with security-conscious customers continually push the boundaries of
    how quickly investigations must begin, progress, and complete. Today, it’s not
    unusual for a customer to ask for a notification of a potential security problem
    within 24 hours (or less) of initial detection.

- en: Triage is a well-established skill in the emergency medical community. An emergency
    medical technician (EMT) arriving on the scene of a vehicle accident will first
    make sure there are no immediate risks of further injury to anyone at the scene,
    and then perform triage. For example, if a bus has collided with a car, a few
    pieces of information are already logically available. The people in the car may
    have sustained serious injuries, because a collision with a heavy bus can inflict
    a great deal of damage. A bus can hold many passengers, so there may be multiple
    injuries to passengers. It’s unlikely that any dangerous chemicals are present,
    because neither vehicle would typically carry them. Within the first minute of
    arriving, the EMT knows that they’ll need to call for more ambulances, possibly
    alert a critical care unit, and call the fire department to free any trapped occupants
    from the smaller vehicle. They probably don’t need a hazardous materials cleanup
    crew.

    that breaks production, an SRE might take immediate action to revert the CL, making
    the problem go away. Once the problem is fixed, the SRE will begin investigating

    may seem simple and perhaps unnecessary, but being explicit in order to avoid
    misunderstandings is a core principle of both command and communications. Beginning
    your incident with a declaration is the first step in aligning everyone’s expectations.
    Incidents are complex and unusual, involve high amounts of tension, and happen

    your forensic findings with law enforcement or a third-party firm that will aid
    in your investigation, but if you plan to share your findings in the future, your
    raw investigation notes won’t be helpful. Assign someone to prepare a redacted

    roles at any time, so you assign someone the *remediation lead* (RL) role at any
    point during the incident. The RL can begin studying the areas of confirmed compromise
    as the ops team discovers them. Armed with this information, the RL can create
    a plan to clean up and fix these compromised areas later. When the ops team completes
    their investigation, the IC will already have the cleanup plan in place. At this
    point, rather than deciding next steps on the spot, they can initiate the next
    phase of work. Similarly, if you have the staff available, it’s never too early

  zh: 随着调查的进行，你决定是时候将事件响应的一些组件并行化。如果攻击者可能访问了你组织的用户数据，你可能需要通知用户。你还需要减轻攻击。你选择了一位技术写作能力强的同事担任沟通负责人（CL）。你要求一位不参与取证工作的系统管理员成为整改负责人（RL）。
- en: In collaboration with the organization’s attorney, the CL drafts a blog post
    that explains what happened and the potential customer impact. Although there
    are many blanks (such as “<*fill this in*> data was <*fill this in*>”), having
    the structure ready and approved ahead of time helps you to communicate your message
    much faster when you know the full details.

  zh: 与组织的律师合作，CL起草了一篇博客文章，解释了发生了什么以及潜在的客户影响。尽管还有许多空白（比如“<*填写此处*>数据被<*填写此处*>”），但提前准备好并获得批准的结构可以帮助你在了解全部细节时更快地传达你的信息。
- en: Meanwhile, the RL makes a list of every resource the organization knows to have
    been affected by the attacker, along with proposals for how to clean up each resource.
    Even if you know that the engineer’s password wasn’t exposed in the initial phishing
    email, you’ll need to change their account credentials. To be on the safe side,
    you decide to guard against backdoors that you haven’t yet found but that may
    appear later. You make a copy of the engineer’s important data and then erase
    their home directory, creating a new one on a freshly installed workstation.

  zh: 与此同时，RL制定了组织已知受攻击者影响的每一项资源清单，以及清理每个资源的方案。即使你知道工程师的密码并没有在最初的钓鱼邮件中泄露，你也需要更改他们的账户凭据。为了安全起见，你决定防范尚未发现但可能随后出现的后门。你复制了工程师的重要数据，然后擦除了他们的主目录，在新安装的工作站上创建了一个新的主目录。
- en: As your response progresses, your team learns that the attacker didn’t access
    any production data—to everyone’s great relief! The additional VMs the attacker
    launched appear to be a swarm of coin mining servers that mine digital currency
    and direct the funds to the attacker’s virtual wallet. Your RL notes that you
    can delete these machines, or you can snapshot and archive the machines if you
    wish to report the incident to law enforcement later on. You can also delete the
    project the machines were created in.

- en: Around mid-afternoon, your team has run out of leads. They’ve searched every
    resource the malicious API keys may have touched, built their mitigation document,
    and confirmed that the attacker didn’t touch any sensitive data. Fortunately,
    this was an opportunistic coin mining exercise and the attacker wasn’t interested
    in any of your data—just a lot of compute capability on someone else’s bill. Your
    team decides that it’s time to execute your remediation plan. After checking in
    with legal and leadership to ensure that the decision to close out the incident
    has their approval, you signal the team that it’s time to act.

  zh: 到了下午中期，你的团队已经没有了线索。他们搜索了可能受到恶意API密钥影响的每一个资源，制定了减轻方案，并确认攻击者没有触及任何敏感数据。幸运的是，这只是一次机会主义的挖矿行为，攻击者并不关心你的任何数据，只是想在别人的账单上使用大量计算能力。你的团队决定是时候执行你的整改计划了。在与法律和领导层核实关闭事件决定得到他们的批准后，你向团队发出了行动的信号。
- en: Freed from their forensic tasks, the operations team now divides up the tasks
    from the remediation plan and completes them as quickly as possible, ensuring
    that the attacker is shut off quickly and completely. They then spend the rest
    of the afternoon writing down their observations for a postmortem. Finally, you
    (the IC) hold an outbrief, where everyone on the team has the opportunity to discuss
    how the incident went. You clearly communicate that the incident is closed and
    no longer requires an emergency response. Your last task before everyone goes
    home to rest is to brief the London team so they also know that the incident is
    completed.

  zh: 完成了取证任务后，运营团队现在根据整改计划分配任务，并尽快完成，确保攻击者被迅速而彻底地关闭。然后，他们花了下午的时间写下他们的观察结果以供事后分析。最后，你（IC）进行了简报，团队中的每个人都有机会讨论事件的进展。你明确地传达了事件已经结束，不再需要紧急响应。在每个人回家休息之前，你最后的任务是向伦敦团队简报，让他们也知道事件已经结束。

  zh: 解决方案
- en: Incident management, when scaled, becomes its own art that is distinct and separate
    from general project management and smaller incident response work. By focusing
    on processes, tools, and proper organizational structures, it’s possible to staff
    a team that can effectively respond to any crisis at the speed today’s market
    requires. Whether you’re a small organization whose engineers and core team become
    a temporary response team as needed, a giant-scale organization with response
    teams across the globe, or anything in between, you can apply the best practices
    described in this chapter to effectively and efficiently respond to a security
    compromise. Parallelizing your incident response and forensic work and professionally
    managing the team using ICS/IMAG will help you respond scalably and reliably to
    any incidents that arise.

  zh: 3. 事故管理在规模化时，成为一门独立的艺术，与一般项目管理和较小的事故响应工作有所不同。通过专注于流程、工具和适当的组织结构，可以组建一个能够以当今市场所需的速度有效应对任何危机的团队。无论您是一个小型组织，其工程师和核心团队根据需要成为临时响应团队，还是一个全球范围内设有响应团队的大型组织，或者介于两者之间，您都可以应用本章描述的最佳实践，有效高效地应对安全威胁。并行化您的事故响应和取证工作，并使用ICS/IMAG专业管理团队，将帮助您可扩展、可靠地应对任何突发事件。

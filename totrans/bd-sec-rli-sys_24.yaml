    Who performs that recovery, and do they know what decisions to make? [Chapter
    17 of the SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/testing-reliability/)
    and [Chapter 9 of the SRE workbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/incident-response/)
    discuss practices for preventing and managing service outages. Many of those practices
    are also relevant to security, but recovering from security attacks has unique
    elements—particularly when the incident involves an active malicious attacker
    (see [Chapter 2](ch02.html#understanding_adversaries)). For this reason, while
    this chapter provides a general outline for handling many kinds of recovery efforts,
    we place a particular emphasis on what recovery engineers need to know about security
    attacks.

  zh: 如果您的组织遭遇严重事件，您会知道如何恢复吗？谁来执行恢复，他们知道要做出什么决定吗？ SRE书的第17章和SRE工作手册的第9章讨论了预防和管理服务中断的做法。这些做法中的许多做法也与安全相关，但是从安全攻击中恢复具有独特的元素，特别是当事件涉及主动恶意攻击者时（参见第2章）。因此，虽然本章提供了处理许多种恢复工作的一般概述，但我们特别强调恢复工程师需要了解有关安全攻击的内容。
- en: As we discuss in Chapters [8](ch08.html#design_for_resilience) and [9](ch09.html#design_for_recovery),
    systems built according to good design principles can be resilient against attack
    and easily recoverable. This is true whether the system is a single compute instance,
    a distributed system, or a complex multitiered application. To facilitate recovery,
    a well-built system must also be integrated with crisis management tactics. As
    discussed in the previous chapter, effective crisis management entails a delicate
    balance between continuing to deter an attacker while restoring any injured assets
    to a known (potentially improved) good state. This chapter describes the nuanced
    considerations that good recovery checklists incorporate to achieve these goals.

  zh: 正如我们在第8章和第9章中讨论的，根据良好设计原则构建的系统可以抵御攻击并且易于恢复。无论系统是单个计算实例、分布式系统还是复杂的多层应用程序，都是如此。为了促进恢复，良好构建的系统还必须与危机管理策略相结合。如前一章所述，有效的危机管理需要在继续威慑攻击者的同时恢复任何受损资产到已知（可能改进的）良好状态之间取得微妙的平衡。本章描述了良好的恢复检查表所包含的微妙考虑，以实现这些目标。
- en: In our experience, recovery engineers are often the people who design, implement,
    and maintain these systems every day. During an attack, you may need to call in
    security specialists for particular roles, such as performing forensic activities,
    triaging security vulnerabilities, or making nuanced decisions (see [Chapter 17](ch17.html#oneseven_crisis_management)),
    but recovering systems to a known good state requires the expertise that comes
    from working with the system every day. A partnership between incident coordination
    and recovery efforts allows security specialists and recovery engineers to bidirectionally
    share information to restore the system.

    than preplanned playbooks can accommodate.^([1](ch18.html#ch18fn1)) An attacker

    tools like bug tracking systems, cloud-based collaboration tools, whiteboards,
    and even notecards taped to a wall. Make sure those tools are outside the broadest

    the attacker, do you delete the malware and leave the systems running, or do you
    reinstall the systems? Depending on the complexity and criticality of your systems,
    you may have to consider the tradeoffs between these options. On the one hand,
    if the affected systems are mission-critical and difficult to rebuild, you may
    be tempted to delete the attacker’s malware and move on. On the other hand, if
    the attacker has installed multiple types of malware and you don’t know about
    all of them, you may end up missing the opportunity for a comprehensive cleanup.
    Typically, reinstalling systems from scratch with known good images and software

    You need to identify all the binaries built during the “at risk” time frame, where
    those binaries were deployed, and any dependencies they have. When performing
    this examination, clearly mark the known compromised code, libraries, and binaries.
    You should also create tests that will prevent you from reintroducing vulnerable

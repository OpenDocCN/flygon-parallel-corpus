    build secure and reliable systems, your efforts will be effective only if your
    entire organization is invested in a culture of security and reliability. Culture
    is a powerful and unique defining component of every organization, and you should
    not underestimate its role in your ability to institute change.

- en: '[Part V](#organization_and_culture) of this book focuses on cultural aspects
    of implementing the approaches presented thus far. Chrome was one of the first
    products at Google to have a dedicated security team, actively promoting a security-centric
    culture. We start with a case study of that team, focusing on its role in Chrome’s
    popularity and success. In [Chapter 20](ch20.html#twozero_understanding_roles_and_respons),
    we posit that everyone in an organization is responsible for security and reliability.
    The role of security specialists should be to implement security-specific technologies
    that require specialist knowledge, and to devise best practices, policies, and
    training. [Chapter 21](ch21.html#twoone_building_a_culture_of_security_a) rounds
    out the book with a discussion of strategies for fostering a healthy culture of
    security and reliability.'

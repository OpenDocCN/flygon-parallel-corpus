- en: 'If everyone is responsible for security and reliability, then you might wonder:
    what exactly is the role of a security specialist or reliability expert? According
    to one school of thought, the engineers building a given system should primarily
    focus on its core functionality. For example, developers might focus on building
    a set of critical user journeys for a mobile phone–based app. Complementing the
    work of the developer team, a security-focused engineer will look at the app from
    the perspective of an attacker aiming to undermine its safety. A reliability-focused
    engineer can help understand the dependency chains and, based on these, identify
    what metrics should be measured that will lead to happy customers and an SLA-compliant
    system. This division of labor is common in many development environments, but
    it’s important that these types of roles work together rather than in isolation.'

  zh: 如果每个人都对安全和可靠性负责，那么您可能会想：安全专家或可靠性专家的角色究竟是什么？根据一种观点，构建特定系统的工程师应该主要关注其核心功能。例如，开发人员可能会专注于为基于手机的应用程序构建一组关键用户体验。在开发团队的工作之外，一个以安全为重点的工程师将从攻击者的角度审视该应用程序，以破坏其安全性。一个以可靠性为重点的工程师可以帮助理解依赖链，并根据这些依赖链确定应该测量哪些指标，这些指标将导致客户满意和符合SLA的系统。这种分工在许多开发环境中很常见，但重要的是这些角色应该共同合作，而不是孤立工作。
- en: 'To expand on this idea further, depending on the complexity of a system, an
    organization may need people with specialized experience to make nuanced judgment
    calls. Since it’s not possible to build an absolutely secure system that’s resilient
    against every attack, or a system that is perfectly reliable, advice from experts
    can help steer development teams. Ideally, this guidance should be integrated
    into the development lifecycle. This integration can take multiple forms, and
    security and reliability specialists should work directly with developers or other
    specialists that consult at each stage of the lifecycle to improve systems.^([1](ch20.html#ch20fn1))

    In creating awareness, a specialist can help the organization become more secure

- en: First off, for security to be effective, it must be carefully balanced with
    your organization’s other requirements. To put this guideline in perspective,
    we can make Google nearly 100% safe from malicious actors by turning off our datacenters,
    networks, computing devices, and so on. While doing so would achieve a high level
    of safety, Google would no longer have customers and would disappear into the
    annals of failed companies. Availability is a core tenet of security! In order
    to craft a reasonable security strategy, you need to understand what the business
    requires to operate (and in the case of most companies, what it takes to earn
    a profit). Find the right balance between the requirements of your business and
    adequate security controls.

  zh: 首先，为了使安全有效，必须仔细平衡组织的其他要求。为了让这一准则更具体化，我们可以通过关闭数据中心、网络、计算设备等来使谷歌几乎100%免受恶意行为的影响。虽然这样做可以实现高水平的安全性，但谷歌将不再拥有客户，并将消失在失败公司的历史中。可用性是安全的核心原则！为了制定合理的安全策略，你需要了解业务运营所需的内容（对于大多数公司来说，赚取利润所需的内容）。找到业务需求和充分的安全控制之间的平衡。
- en: Secondly, security is everyone’s responsibility. You can reduce the cost of
    some security processes by distributing it among the teams affected the most.
    For example, consider a company that has six products, each staffed with a product
    team and protected by 20 firewalls. In this scenario, one common approach is to
    have a central security team maintain the configuration of all 120 firewalls.
    This setup requires the security team to have extensive knowledge of six different
    products—a recipe for eventual reliability issues or delays in system changes,
    all of which can increase the cost of your security program. An alternative approach

    and practices. People are the most important drivers of these processes and practices.

    are unpredictable. At the end of the day, ensuring that everyone in your organization
    is responsible for security and reliability is the best defense!

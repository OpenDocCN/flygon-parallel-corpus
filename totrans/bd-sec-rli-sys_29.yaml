  zh: 结论
- en: We wrote this book because we believe there is a significant overlap in the
    technologies and practices that protect systems and keep them reliable, and that
    organizations should integrate the concepts of security and reliability throughout
    the process of designing, implementing, and maintaining systems. Whereas traditionally
    they have been treated as separate disciplines, our view is that security and
    reliability are inherent properties of a system, and they are therefore the responsibility
    of everyone involved in the project lifecycle. Many technology shifts are well
    underway that we believe will inspire organizations to take this view.

  zh: 我们写这本书是因为我们相信在保护系统和保持其可靠性的技术和实践中存在重要的重叠，并且组织应该在设计、实施和维护系统的过程中整合安全和可靠性的概念。传统上，它们被视为独立的学科，但我们认为安全和可靠性是系统的固有属性，因此是项目生命周期中所有参与者的责任。许多技术变革已经在进行中，我们相信这将激励组织采取这种观点。
- en: This technology revolution—what some have deemed the Fourth Industrial Revolution—is
    altering the world as we know it. This shift is being felt not only by consumers,
    in the form of more sophisticated products, but also by the developers who are
    producing these products. Organizations are increasingly reliant on technology,
    even if it’s not the core of their business. For example, we’re seeing systems
    that let surgeons perform surgery on patients located on the opposite side of
    the world. Scientists are using autonomous flying vehicles to survey archaeological
    sites, study the effects of soil erosion, and protect endangered species. Robots
    are being deployed to perform dangerous work in space and at nuclear disaster
    sites.

  zh: 这种技术革命——有些人称之为第四次工业革命——正在改变我们所知道的世界。这种转变不仅被消费者所感受到，以更复杂的产品形式，而且也被生产这些产品的开发人员所感受到。组织越来越依赖技术，即使它不是他们业务的核心。例如，我们看到了让外科医生在世界另一端的患者上进行手术的系统。科学家正在使用自主飞行器勘测考古遗址，研究土壤侵蚀的影响，并保护濒危物种。机器人被部署进行太空和核灾难现场的危险工作。
- en: The expanding connectedness of technology means we are growing more dependent
    on the reliability of those solutions. As we extend our data surfaces to third
    parties, we need confidence that it’s safe to do so. The trust we build with people
    is based on the reliability and security of the technologies on which we choose
    to run our infrastructure. This is true for organizations of any size, from a
    three-person open source project that thousands of other projects rely upon to
    a large multinational corporation selling a product to a global user base.

  zh: 科技的不断连接意味着我们越来越依赖这些解决方案的可靠性。当我们将数据表面扩展到第三方时，我们需要确信这样做是安全的。我们与人们建立的信任是基于我们选择运行基础设施的技术的可靠性和安全性。这对于任何规模的组织都是如此，从一个三人的开源项目，成千上万其他项目依赖它，到一个向全球用户销售产品的大型跨国公司。
- en: The complexity of modern systems, and the velocity at which they are developed,
    means that safety and reliability need to be integrated from a product’s inception
    for maximum effectiveness. Seeing security and reliability as inherent properties
    of a system is not only natural but critical in today’s automated, connected,
    and complex technological landscape.

  zh: 现代系统的复杂性和它们的开发速度意味着安全性和可靠性需要从产品的开始阶段进行整合，以实现最大的效果。将安全性和可靠性视为系统的固有属性不仅是自然的，而且在今天的自动化、连接和复杂的技术环境中至关重要。
- en: It’s no surprise, then, that within the broader community, DevOps and DevSecOps
    are driving the conversations around the sustainability of systems. However, the
    notion of an integrated security and reliability model will take time to evolve
    and become a natural part of the ecosystem. Many development lifecycles and organizations
    are functionally centered around the division of labor between teams responsible
    for the development, testing, security, reliability, and operation of a system.
    This model will need to transform to meet the demands of the technology shifts
    we are seeing.

  zh: 因此，在更广泛的社区中，DevOps和DevSecOps正在推动关于系统可持续性的讨论。然而，一个集成的安全和可靠性模型的概念将需要时间来发展，并成为生态系统的自然组成部分。许多开发生命周期和组织在功能上都围绕着负责系统开发、测试、安全、可靠性和运营的团队之间的分工。这种模式需要转变以满足我们所看到的技术变革的需求。
- en: In writing this book, we brought together teams from across Google—from developers
    to SREs to security engineers. This collaboration reflects the interactive spirit
    Google relies on to secure its systems and make them increasingly reliable. At
    Google, we make security and reliability concerns part of the product development
    process, and encourage people with different experiences and skills to work together
    and listen to the perspective that others bring. Because the people are as important
    as the systems themselves, we recommend investing thoughtfully in how you design
    your teams and structure their responsibilities and incentives. People need to
    agree on common requirements before they debate technical solutions for which
    consensus might be difficult to achieve. Don’t underestimate the investment required
    to build trust and ensure you’re all speaking a common language.

  zh: 在撰写本书时，我们邀请了来自谷歌各个团队的成员——从开发人员到SREs再到安全工程师。这种合作反映了谷歌依赖于保护其系统并使其越来越可靠的互动精神。在谷歌，我们将安全性和可靠性问题纳入产品开发过程，并鼓励具有不同经验和技能的人们共同合作，并倾听其他人带来的观点。因为人与系统本身一样重要，我们建议在设计团队和构建其责任和激励结构时进行深思熟虑的投资。人们需要在讨论技术解决方案之前就共同的要求达成一致意见，而这可能很难实现。不要低估建立信任和确保大家都在说一种共同语言所需的投资。
- en: 'For those who are passionate about security and reliability, we conclude with
    the following advice: your ability to work across knowledge domains and embed
    expertise in the right places is key to your organization’s success. Security
    and reliability need to be an integrated part of the entire computing environment.
    All these pieces must work together in harmony to solve problems. No checklist
    or silver-bullet advice we could give can compensate for your own ability to help
    your organization flex and grow as the nature of the security and reliability
    challenges it faces evolves.'

  zh: 对于那些对安全和可靠性充满热情的人，我们总结如下建议：你跨知识领域工作的能力，并将专业知识嵌入到合适的位置，是你的组织成功的关键。安全和可靠性需要成为整个计算环境的一个整合部分。所有这些要素必须和谐地共同工作来解决问题。我们所能给出的任何清单或灵丹妙药的建议都无法弥补你自己帮助组织在安全和可靠性挑战的性质不断演变时灵活成长的能力。
- en: As we come to the end of this book, we anticipate that it will mark the beginning
    of many important conversations. We hope you will join in this discussion too,
    by participating in communities with other professionals and sharing your stories.
    In this dialogue, we encourage you to honor the many viewpoints that different
    roles bring to the table, support the search for solutions, and share what has
    worked for you. We’re confident that this conversation will help all of us in
    our effort to create secure and reliable systems.

- en: For a thorough disaster risk analysis, we recommend ranking the risks facing
    your organization by using a standardized matrix that accounts for each risk’s
    probability of occurrence and its potential impact to the organization. [Table A-1](#sample_disaster_risk_assessment_matrix)
    is a sample risk assessment matrix that both large and small organizations can
    tailor to the specifics of their systems.

- en: To use the matrix, assess the values appropriate for each of the columns of
    probability and impact. As we emphasize in [Chapter 16](ch16.html#onesix_disaster_planning),
    these values are likely dependent on what your organization does, its infrastructure,
    and where it is located. An organization operating out of Los Angeles, CA, in
    the US may have a higher likelihood of experiencing an earthquake than an organization
    operating out of Hamburg, Germany. If your organization has offices in many locations,
    you may even want to do a risk assessment per location.

- en: Once you’ve calculated the probability and impact values, multiply them to determine
    the rank of each risk. The resulting values can be used to order the risks from
    highest to lowest, which serves as a guide for prioritization and preparation.
    A risk that ranks 0.8 will likely require more immediate attention than risks
    that have a value of 0.5 or 0.3\. Be sure to develop response plans for the most
    critical risks your organization faces.

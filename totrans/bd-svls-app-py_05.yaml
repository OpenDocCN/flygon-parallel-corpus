    the basics and the internals of AWS's serverless service, AWS Lambda. We have
    also created some example serverless projects to understand the concepts better.
    During the course of our learning, we have also learned the basics of several
    other AWS services, such as alarms, SNS, SQS, S3 buckets, and CloudWatch.

    the serverless systems that we are building. Logging and monitoring software code
    and systems are very important, as they helps us with the telemetry and disaster
    recovery. Logging is a process where we store the logs emitted by our code or
    by our architecture as a whole. Monitoring is a process where we closely monitor
    the activities, status, and health of the components and processes in our code
    or architecture.

    AWS Lambda, which is closely integrated with the monitoring service of AWS, the
    CloudWatch Dashboards. We will also learn about the logging service of AWS, the
    CloudWatch Logs service. Finally, we will also learn about and understand the
    distributed tracing and monitoring service of AWS, the CloudTrail service.

    We have already looked at and learned about the CloudWatch Alarms, which are a
    sub-feature of CloudWatch. We will now learn about the graphing suite of the service.
    Almost every service in the AWS environment has a way to send it's logs and metrics
    to CloudWatch for logging and monitoring purposes. Each service might have several
    metrics which can be monitored, depending on the function.

    options for our Lambda functions, it is always preferable to use the first option

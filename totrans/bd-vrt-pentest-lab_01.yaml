    many subareas that also have to be considered when it comes to building a secure

    each of these areas.

    some form of authentication and as such this is usually the first area we secure.
    This could be something as simple as users selecting a complex password or adding
    additional factors to the authentication such as a token, biometric, or certificates.
    No single factor of authentication is considered to be secure in today's networks.

    a component of some security models. This is one approach to take, but it is preferred
    to include it in most testing models. The concept of authorization is essential
    as it is how we assign the rights and permissions to access a resource, and we
    would want to ensure its security. Authorization allows us to have different types
    of users with separate privilege levels to coexist within a system.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of confidentiality is the assurance that something we want to be
    protected on the machine or network is safe and not at the risk of being compromised.
    This is made harder by the fact that the protocol (TCP/IP) running the Internet
    today was developed in the early 1970s. At that time, the Internet was used on
    just a few computers, and now that the Internet has grown to the size it is today
    and as we are still running the same protocol from those early days, it makes
    it more difficult to preserve confidentiality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to note that when the developers created the protocol, the network
    was very small and there was an inherent sense of trust with the person you potentially
    could be communicating. This sense of trust is what we continue to fight from
    a security standpoint today. The concept from that early creation was, and still
    is, that you could trust data when it is received from a reliable source. We know
    that the Internet is now of a huge size. However, this is definitely not the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Integrity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Integrity is similar to confidentiality. Here, we are concerned with the compromise
    of the information and with the accuracy of the data and the fact that it is not
    modified in transit or from its original form. A common way of doing this is to
    use a hashing algorithm to validate that the file is unaltered.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the most difficult things to secure is the availability, that is, the
    right to have a service when required. The irony about "availability" is that
    when a particular resource is available to one user, then it is available to all.
    Everything seems perfect from the perspective of an honest/legitimate user; however,
    not all users are honest/legitimate due to the sheer fact that resources are finite
    and they can be flooded or exhausted. Hence, it is all the more difficult to protect
    this area.

    something; consequently, this is the one I usually have the most trouble with.
    We know that a computer system can be and/or has been compromised many times and
    also the art of spoofing is not a new concept. With these facts in our minds,
    the claim that "we can guarantee the origin of a transmission by a particular
    person from a particular computer" is not entirely accurate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we do not know the state of the machine, whether the machine is secure and
    not compromised, this might be an accurate claim. However, to make this claim
    in the networks that we have today would be a very difficult thing to do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All it takes is one compromised machine and then the theory that "you can guarantee
    the sender" goes out the window. We will not cover each of the components of security
    testing in detail here because this is beyond the scope of what we are trying
    to achieve. The point we want to get across in this section is that security testing
    is the concept of looking at each and every component of security and addressing
    them by determining the amount of risk an organization has from them and then
    mitigating that risk.

    to do once I get to the door to gain access, but if it is open, then I know it
    is possible to get access, and if it is closed, then I know I cannot go through
    that door. This is the same as ports; if they are closed, then we cannot go into
    that machine using that door. We have a number of ways to check whether there
    are any open ports, and we will continue with the same theme and use nmap. We

    it is a very minor part of professional security testing, but it is fun so we
    will briefly look at the process. We also like to say in security testing that
    we have to validate and verify everything a tool reports to you and this is what
    we try to do with exploitation. The point is that you are executing a piece of
    code on a client's machine and this code could cause damage. The most popular
    free tool for exploitation is metasploit, now owned by Rapid7\. There are entire
    books written on this tool, so we will just show the results of running the tools
    and exploiting a machine here.

    is the process that takes the most time to develop. Most testers can run tools,
    perform manual testing and exploitation, but the real challenge is taking all
    of the results and analyzing them. We will look at one example of this in the
    next screenshot. Take a moment and review the protocol analysis capture from the
    Wireskark tool. As an analyst, you need to know what the protocol analyzer is
    showing you. Do you know what exactly is happening? Do not worry, we will tell
    you after the screenshot. Take a minute and see if you can determine what the
    tool is reporting with the packets that are shown in the following screenshot:'

    replies with an **ICMP** packet that is type 3, code 13\. In other words, the
    reason the packet is being rejected is because the communication is administratively
    filtered; furthermore, this tells us that there is a router in place, and it has
    an **Access Control List** (**ACL**) that is blocking the packet. Moreover, it
    tells us that the administrator is not following best practices to absorb packets
    and does not reply with any error messages as that can assist an attacker. This
    is just one small example of the data analysis step; there are many things you
    will encounter and many more that you will have to analyze to determine what is
    taking place in the tested environment. Remember that the smarter the administrator,
    the more challenging pen testing can become. This is actually a good thing for
    security!

    This is unfortunate as it is one of the most important things you need to master.
    You have to be able to present a report of your findings to the client. These
    findings will assist them in improving their security posture and if they like
    the report, it is what they will most often share with partners and other colleagues.
    This is your advertisement for what separates you from the others. It showcases
    that not only do you know how to follow a systematic process and methodology of
    professional testing but also know how to put it into an output form that can
    serve as a reference for the clients.

- en: After more than twenty years of performing professional security testing, I
    find it is amazing to know how many are confused about what a penetration test
    is. I have, on many occasions, been to a meeting and the client is convinced that
    they want a penetration test. However, when I explain exactly what one is, they
    look at me with a shocked look. So, what exactly is a penetration test? Remember
    our abstract methodology had a step for intrusive target search and part of that
    step was another methodology for scanning? Well, the last item in the scanning
    methodology, that being exploitation, is the step that is indicative of a penetration
    test. That one step is the validation of vulnerabilities, and this is what defines
    penetration testing. Again, it is not what most clients think when they bring
    a team in. The majority of them in reality want a vulnerability assessment. When
    you start explaining to them that you are going to run some exploit code and all
    these really cool things on their systems and/or networks, they usually are quite
    surprised. Most often, the client will want you to stop at the validation step.
    On some occasions, they will ask you to prove what you have found and then you
    might get to show the validation. I once was in a meeting with the stock market
    IT department of a foreign country, and when I explained what we were about to
    do with validation of vulnerabilities, the IT Director's reaction was "that is
    my stock broker records, and if we lose them, we lose a lot of money!". Hence,
    we did not perform the validation step in that test.

    and we identified an abstract methodology that consists of the following steps:
    planning, nonintrusive target search, intrusive target search, data analysis,
    and reporting. More importantly, we expanded the abstract model when it came to
    the intrusive target search, and we defined within that a methodology for scanning.
    This consisted of identifying live systems, looking at the open ports, recovering
    the services, enumeration, identifying vulnerabilities, and finally exploitation.'

    of vulnerabilities and that it is identified with one step in our scanning methodology.
    Unfortunately, most clients do not understand that when you validate vulnerabilities,
    it requires you to run code that could potentially damage a machine or even worse,
    damage their data. Due to this, most clients ask that not be a part of the test.
    We have created a baseline for what penetration testing is in this chapter, and
    we will use this definition throughout this book. In the next chapter, we will
    discuss the process of choosing your virtual environment.

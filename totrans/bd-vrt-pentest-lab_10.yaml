    it is flat, that is, there is nothing between us and the target. This makes our
    task much easier; furthermore, the inside of the network is usually the place
    that has the most trusted location, and as such, it offers the least resistance,
    especially when it comes to layer two and the assignment of the physical **Media
    Access Control (MAC)** addresses. In this chapter, we will discuss the following

    or white-box testing, we do not have the same challenges that we have when we
    are trying to conduct an external or black-box test. This does not mean that when
    the network is flat and we are inside it, we do not have challenges; there are
    a number of challenges that we may encounter. Furthermore, we have to be prepared
    for protection such as Host Based Intrusion Prevention, antivirus, host firewalls,
    and **Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit** (**EMET**) that the administrator
    might have deployed.

    of different threat vectors. Moreover, we want to access the network as an unauthenticated

    works well with our tools that we use inside the network.

    in this chapter, we explained that with the firewall on, there was a limitation
    on what we could see when we conducted a vulnerability scan. We will proceed further
    in our testing, so we can see what challenges the host firewall can present and
    then see the methods we can use to get data from the target even when the firewall
    is on.

- en: As you may recall, with our scanning methodology, we look for the live systems,
    followed by the ports, and then the services. From there, we perform enumeration,
    identify vulnerabilities, and then exploitation when it is allowed as per our
    scope of work. Well, what we need to do now is first look at this process with
    the firewall off and then with the firewall on across a sampling of the various
    defined zones. We will use the Kali Linux virtual machine and the Windows 7 machine
    as a target for our testing.

  zh: 正如您可能记得的，根据我们的扫描方法论，我们首先寻找活动系统，然后是端口，接着是服务。从那里，我们进行枚举，识别漏洞，然后根据我们的工作范围进行利用。现在，我们需要做的是首先关闭防火墙，然后在各个定义的区域的样本上打开防火墙。我们将使用Kali
    Linux虚拟机和Windows 7机器作为我们测试的目标。

    on the **Home or work (private) networks** settings. This is probably not what
    we will encounter in an environment; the **Public networks** settings would more
    than likely be in the on state, but for our testing, this will serve the purpose.
    So, the question is what do the different zones mean with respect to the settings
    for the firewall with the most recent versions of Windows not as much as with
    a Windows Server 2003 for instance?

    We saw an example of this earlier, so we will only briefly cover the topic here.
    The important thing to remember is all of these protections usually have something
    that has to be allowed through, and in testing, it is our task to try and discover
    this and reveal the weakness. We looked at the Symantec tool and discovered that
    if we use a standard payload that has a signature on it, then we more than likely
    will get detected. If we do get a shell on a protected machine, then it is just
    a matter of identifying the service and then terminating it. This can all be done
    using the metasploit tool as long as we select Meterpreter as the payload.

    (EMET) tool provided from Microsoft is probably one of the toughest tools you
    might encounter on the machine. The deployment of this protection is still in
    its infancy, but if you do run across it in your testing, it can be quite challenging
    to get around. It is one of the reasons that Microsoft started supporting the
    "Bugs for Bounty" concept where they will pay for the bugs that are discovered
    in their software in their latest operating systems.

    run into an EMET-protected machine, you will have to come up with custom payloads
    as well as other methods to try and bypass it, but good luck! As the iterations
    of EMET continue to mature, it will be more and more difficult to get by it. The
    goal would be to stop the EMET process once the access has been gained and then
    carry out the attack; otherwise, use custom payloads and hope that you can bypass
    the EMET protection.

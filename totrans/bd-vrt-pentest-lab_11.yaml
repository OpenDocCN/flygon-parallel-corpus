- en: 'In this chapter, we will identify the methods we use to attack services and
    servers. The nice thing about this is that we know a server has to have the service
    running and, more importantly, have the socket in a listening state, ready to
    accept connections. Moreover, this means that the server sits there and just waits
    for us to attack it. This is good for us, as we already covered this in [Chapter
    9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Assessment of Web Servers and Web Applications"), *Assessment
    of Web Servers and Web Applications*. The most common attack vector we are going
    to see is the web applications that are running on a web server. It is not our
    intention to cover this again here; instead, we will focus on other things that
    we can attack on the server platforms we encounter. In this chapter, we will be
    discussing the following topics:'

    a flaw. Unfortunately, this is becoming more and more rare. Microsoft and other
    vendors have done their homework, and the vectors of attack against the OS are
    not dead, but they could be considered to be on life support. Therefore, we want

    server. Then, we need a machine that will serve as the external machine, sending
    traffic from the outside. You need to create routes on both sides of the filtering
    device. Additionally, create the rule to allow FTP traffic and the return traffic.
    Remember that the return traffic will have a source port of 20\. Once you have
    built the required architecture, it is just a matter of working through the commands.

    Linux机器发送命令并运行`netcat`；我们将使用受保护机器上的3com FTP服务器。

    connection is in the filtering device; therefore, by sending the data from this
    port, we can penetrate into a weak filter. We use the FTP server on the inside
    to demonstrate the point. We could have chosen any open port on the machine to
    show this. We now need to log in to the server, and it is likely that `anonymous`

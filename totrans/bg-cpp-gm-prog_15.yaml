- en: In this chapter, we will be adding all the sound effects and the HUD. We have
    done this in both of the previous projects, but we will do things a bit differently
    this time. We will explore the concept of sound **spatialization** and how SFML
    makes this otherwise complicated concept nice and easy; in addition, we will build
    a HUD class to encapsulate the code that draws information to the screen.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spatialization is the act of making something relative to the space it is a
    part of, or within. In our daily lives, everything in the natural world, by default,
    is spatialized. If a motorbike whizzes past from left to right we will hear the
    sound grow from faint to loud from one side and as it passes by, it will become
    more prominent in the other ear, before fading into the distance once more. If
    we woke up one morning and the world was no longer spatialized, it would be exceptionally
    weird.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we can make our video games a little bit more like the real world, our players
    can become more immersed. Our zombie game would have been a lot more fun if the
    player could have heard them faintly in the distance and their inhuman wailing
    grew louder as they drew closer, from one direction or another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is probably obvious that the mathematics of spatialization will be complex.
    How do we calculate how loud a given sound will be in a specific speaker, based
    on the direction the sound is coming from, and the distance from the player (the
    hearer of the sound) to the object that is making the sound (the emitter)?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, SFML does all the complicated stuff for us. All we need to do is
    get familiar with a few technical terms and then we can start using SFML to spatialize
    our sound effects.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will need to be aware of a few pieces of information in order to give SFML
    what it needs to do its work. We will need to be aware of where the sound is coming
    from in our game world. This source of the sound is called an **emitter**. In
    a game, the emitter could be a Zombie, a vehicle, or in the case of our current
    project, a fire tile. We already keep track of the position of objects in our
    game, so giving SFML the emitter location will be quite straightforward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next factor we need to be aware of is **attenuation**. Attenuation is the
    rate at which a wave deteriorates. You could simplify that statement and make
    it specific to sound by saying that attenuation is how quickly the sound reduces
    in volume. That isn't technically exact, but it is a good enough description for
    the purposes of this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final factor we need to consider is the **listener**. When SFML spatializes
    the sound, where is it spatializing it relative to? In most games, the logical
    thing to do is use the player character. In our game, we will use Thomas.

    and listeners. Let's take a look at them hypothetically, and then we will write
    some code to add spatialized sound to our project for real.

    attenuation level is usually achieved by experimenting. Generally speaking, the
    higher the level of attenuation, the quicker the sound level reduces to silence.

- en: In the previous code, `m_FramesSinceLastUpdate` is incremented each frame. When
    `m_FramesSinceLastUpdate` exceeds `m_TargetFramesPerHUDUpdate`, execution enters
    the `if` block. Inside the `if` block, we use `stringstream` objects to update
    our `Text`, as we have done in both previous projects. As you probably expected,
    however, in this project we are using the `HUD` class, so we call the `setTime`
    and `setLevel` functions, passing in the current values that the `Text` objects
    need to be set to.

    zero so it can start counting toward the next update.

    Notice that the call to draw the message to that prompts the player to start is
    only used when the game is not currently playing `(!m_Playing)`.

    tick up. When you get back to level one again, notice that you have 10% less time
    than before.

    effects and a simple but informative HUD, but we also have the capability to add
    new levels with ease. At this point, we could call it done.

    look into two gaming concepts. Firstly we will look at particle systems, which
    are how we can handle things such as explosions or other special effects. To achieve
    this, we will need to learn a bit more C++, look at a way we might radically rethink
    how we structure our game code.

    and the programmable graphics pipeline. We will then be in a position to dip our
    toes into the **GLSL** language, which allows us to write code that executes directly
    on the GPU, to create some special effects.

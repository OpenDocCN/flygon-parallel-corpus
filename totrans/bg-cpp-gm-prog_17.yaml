    like a long way off. But it wasn't too tough, I hope!

    to build games in C++.

- en: The point of this chapter is not only to congratulate you on a fine achievement,
    but also to point out that this page probably shouldn't be the end of your journey.
    If, like me, you get a bit of a buzz whenever you make a new game feature come
    to life, then you probably want to learn more.

- en: It might surprise you to hear, that even after all these hundreds of pages,
    we have only dipped our toes into C++. Even the topics we did cover could be covered
    in more depth and there are numerous, some quite significant, topics that we haven't
    even mentioned. With this in mind, let's take a look at what might be next.

    is a formal education. This, of course, is expensive and time consuming, and I
    can't really help any further.

    on a game you will eventually release, then what follows is a discussion of what
    you might like to do next.

- en: Possibly the toughest decision we face with each project is how to structure
    our code. In my opinion, the absolute best source of information on how to structure
    your C++ game code is [http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/).
    Some of the discussion is around concepts not covered in this book, but much of
    it will be completely accessible. If you understand classes, encapsulation, pure
    virtual functions, and singletons, dive in to this website.

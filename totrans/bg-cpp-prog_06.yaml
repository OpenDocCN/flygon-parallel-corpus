- en: C++ allows you to create your own types. These custom types can have operators
    and can be converted to other types; indeed, they can be used like built-in types
    with the behavior that you define. This facility uses a language feature called
    classes. The advantage of being able to define your own types is that you can
    encapsulate data in objects of your chosen type, and use the type to manage the
    lifetime of that data. You can also define the actions that can be performed on
    that data. In other words, you are able to define custom types that have state
    and behavior, which is the basis of object-orientated programming.

- en: When you use built-in types, the data is directly available to whatever code
    has access to that data. C++ provides a mechanism (`const`) to prevent write access,
    but any code can use `const_cast` to cast away `const`-ness. Your data could be
    complex, such as a pointer to a file mapped into memory with the intention that
    your code will change a few bytes and then write the file back to disk. Such raw
    pointers are dangerous because other code with access to the pointer could change
    part of the buffer that should not be changed. What is needed is a mechanism to
    encapsulate the data into a type that knows what bytes to change, and only allow
    that type to access the data. This is the basic idea behind classes.

- en: 'We have already seen one mechanism in C++ to encapsulate data: `struct`. A
    structure allows you to declare data members that are built-in types, pointers,
    or references. When you create a variable from that `struct`, you are creating
    an **instance** of the structure, also known as an **object**. You can create
    variables that are references to this object or pointers that point to the object.
    You can even pass the object by value to a function where the compiler will make
    a copy of the object (it will call the *copy constructor* for the `struct`). We
    have seen that with a `struct` any code that has access to an instance (even through
    a pointer or reference) can access the members of the object (although this can
    be changed). Used like this, a `struct` can be thought of as **aggregate** types
    containing the state.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The members of an instance of a `struct` can be initialized by accessing them
    directly with the dot operator or using the `->` operator through a pointer to
    the object. We have also seen that you can initialize an instance of a `struct`
    with an initializer list (in braces). This is quite restrictive because the initializer
    list has to match the data members in the `struct`. In [Chapter 4](63ba5350-63d3-4dff-9ba2-b330f041d670.xhtml),
    *Working with Memory, Arrays, and Pointers*, you saw that you can have a pointer
    as a member of a `struct`, but you have to explicitly take appropriate action
    to release the memory pointed to by the pointer; if you don't, then this could
    result in a memory leak.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A `struct` is one of the class types that you can use in C++; the other two
    are `union` and `class`. Custom types defined as `struct` or `class` can have
    behaviors as well as state, and C++ allows you to define some special functions
    to control how instances are created and destroyed, copied, and converted. Furthermore,
    you can define operators on a `struct` or `class` type so that you can use the
    operators on instances in a similar way to using the operators on built-in types.
    There is a difference between `struct` and `class` which we will address later,
    but in general the rest of the chapter will be about classes and when a `class`
    is mentioned you can usually assume the same applies to a `struct` as well.

    with multiple statements enclosed by braces `{}`. As it's a statement, you have
    to place a semicolon after the last brace. A class can be defined in a header
    file (as are many of the **C++ Standard Library** classes), but you have to take
    steps to ensure that such files are included only once in a source file. [Chapter
    1](318b7b93-7e5a-437b-95b3-9b6178ece82c.xhtml), *Starting with C++*, describes
    how to do this with `#pragma once`, conditional compilation, and precompiled header
    files. There are, however, some rules about specific items in a class that must
    be defined in a source file, which will be covered later.

    functions and, in an attempt to put all the code for a class into a single header
    file, this makes the code difficult to read and difficult to understand. This
    may be justifiable for a library file maintained by a legion of expert C++ programmers,
    but for your own projects readability should be a key design goal. For this reason,
    a C++ class can be declared in a C++ header file, including its member functions,
    and the actual implementation of the functions can be placed in a source file.
    This makes the header files easier to maintain and more reusable.

    for the assignment to fail halfway through, resulting in an object that is a bit
    of both objects. Furthermore, in construction, an object only exists after the
    construction is successful, so a copy construction cannot happen on an object
    itself, but it is perfectly legal (if pointless) for code to assign an object
    to itself. The copy assignment needs to check for this situation and take appropriate

    it to see if it is `nullptr`. This is so that you do not call a pointer to memory
    for an object that has been deleted: a dangling pointer.'

- en: There are situations when a dangling pointer can occur by design. For example,
    a *parent* object may create *child* objects that have a **back pointer** to the
    parent so that the child has access to the parent. (An example of this is a window
    that creates child controls; it is often useful for the child controls to have
    access to the parent window.) The problem with using a shared pointer in this
    situation is that the parent will have a reference count on each child control
    and each child control has a reference count on the parent, and this creates a
    circular dependency.

- en: Another example is if you have a container of observer objects with the intention
    of being able to inform each of these observer objects when an event occurs by
    calling a method on each one. Maintaining this list can be complicated, particularly
    if an observer object can be deleted, and hence you have to provide a means to
    remove the object from the container (where there will be a `shared_ptr` reference
    count) before you can completely delete the object. It becomes easier if your
    code can simply add a pointer to the object to the container in a way that does
    not maintain a reference count, but allows you to check when the pointer is used
    if the pointer is dangling or points to an existing object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Such a pointer is called a **weak pointer** and the C++11 Standard Library provides
    a class called `weak_ptr`. You cannot use a `weak_ptr` object directly and there
    is no dereference operator. Instead, you create a `weak_ptr` object from a `shared_ptr`
    object and, when you want to access the resource, you create a `shared_ptr` object
    from the `weak_ptr` object. This means that a `weak_ptr` object has the same raw
    pointer, and access to the same control block as the `shared_ptr` object, but
    it does not take part in reference counting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once created, the `weak_ptr` object will enable you to test whether the wrapper
    pointer is to an existing resource or to a resource that has been destroyed. There
    are two ways to do this: either call the member function `expired` or attempt
    to create a `shared_ptr` from the `weak_ptr`. If you are maintaining a collection
    of `weak_ptr` objects, you may decide to periodically iterate through the collection,
    call `expired` on each one, and if the method returns `true`, remove that object
    from the collection. Since the `weak_ptr` object has access to the control block
    created by the original `shared_ptr` object, it can test to see if the reference
    count is zero.'

- en: 'The second way to test to see if a `weak_ptr` object is dangling is to create
    a `shared_ptr` object from it. There are two options. You can create the `shared_ptr`
    object by passing the weak pointer to its constructor and if the pointer has expired,
    the constructor will throw a `bad_weak_ptr` exception. The other way is to call
    the `lock` method on the weak pointer and if the weak pointer has expired, then
    the `shared_ptr` object will be assigned to `nullptr` and you can test for this.
    These three ways are shown here:'

    resources provided by other libraries, such as the C Runtime Library or the Windows
    SDK. It simplifies your code because you do not have to think about where a resource
    handle will go out of scope and provide clean-up code at every point. If the clean-up
    code is complicated, it is typical in C code to see it put at the end of a function
    and every exit point in the function will have a `goto` jump to that code. This
    results in messy code. In this example, we will wrap the C files functions with

    code so that you can write generic code and get the compiler to generate code
    for the types that you require. In the example, you have seen how classes are
    the basis of object orientation. A class encapsulates data, so that the caller
    only needs to know about the expected behavior (in this example, getting the next
    result in a search), without needing to know the details of how the class does
    this. In the next chapter, we will investigate further features of classes; in

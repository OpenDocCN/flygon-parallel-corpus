    with code in a class. You have also seen how to write generic code with templates.
    Classes and encapsulation allow you to combine together code and data as an object.
    In this chapter, you'll learn how to *reuse* code through inheritance and composition
    and how to use class inheritance to write object-orientated code.

    a new class, you have a few choices. The first is called **composition**. With
    composition you add an instance of your utility class as a data member of the
    classes that will use the routine. A simple example is the `string` class--this
    provides all the functionality that you want from a string. It will allocate memory
    according to how many characters have to be stored and deallocate the memory it
    uses when the string object is destroyed. Your class uses the functionality of
    a string, but it is not a string itself, hence it has the string as a data member.

    and this chapter will mention some of them. In basic terms, inheritance is when
    one class *extends* another class the class being extended is called the **base
    class**, **parent class**, or **superclass**, and the class doing the extending
    is called a **derived class**, **child class**, or **subclass**. However, there
    is an important concept to understand with inheritance: the relationship of the
    derived class to the base class. It is commonly given in terms of **is-a**. If
    the derived class is a type of base class, then the relationship is inheritance.
    An mp3 file is an operating system file, so if you have a `os_file` class, then
    you could legitimately derive from it to create an `mp3_file` class.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The derived class has the functionality and state of the base class (although
    it may not have complete access to them, as will be explained later), so it can
    use the functionality of the base class. In this case, it is similar to composition.
    However, there are significant differences. In general, in composition, the composed
    object is used by the class and not exposed directly to the client of the class.
    With inheritance, an object of the derived class is an object of the base class,
    so usually the client code will see the base class functionality. However, a derived
    class can hide the functionality of the base class, so client code will not see
    the hidden base class member, and the derived class can override the base class
    methods and provide its own version.

    type) resides in memory using the `&` operator. The pointer is typed, so the code
    using the pointer assumes that the pointer points to the memory layout of the
    object of the type. Similarly, you can obtain a reference to an object, and the
    reference is an *alias* for the object, that is, operations on the reference occur
    on the object. A pointer (or a reference) to an instance of a derived class can
    be implicitly converted to a pointer (or a reference) to a base class object.
    This means that you can write a function that acts upon base class objects, using
    the behavior of the base class objects, and as long as the parameter is a pointer
    or reference to a base class, you can pass any derived class object to the function.

    inheritance, the derived class still cannot access the `private` members; it only
    has access to `public` and `protected` members and objects of the derived class

    Even if the classes have the same members, they are still different types and
    their pointers are different. However, all derived classes have something in common,
    which is the base class. A derived class pointer can be implicitly converted to
    a base class pointer, so a `base*` pointer can point to an instance of `base`,
    `derived1`, `derived2`, or `derived3`. This means that a generic function taking

    at runtime, and the memory overhead of an extra data member, the `vptr`, for every
    object created from the class. Normally, when client code calls a (non-inline)
    method, the compiler will place a jump to the function in the client code to the
    method. When the client code calls a `virtual` method, the compiler has to dereference

    casts, then you are making the types do something they shouldn't and hence you

    powerful way of writing object-orientated code, which is called **interfaces**.
    An interface is a class that has no functionality; it only has pure virtual functions.
    The purpose of an interface is to define a behavior. A concrete class that derives
    from an interface *must* provide an implementation of all of the methods on the
    interface, and hence this makes the interface a kind of contract. Users of objects
    that implement an interface have a guarantee that the object that has the interface
    will implement *all* the methods of the interface. Interface programming decouples
    behavior from the implementation. Client code is only interested in behavior and
    they are not interested in the actual class that provides the interface.

    a document (setting page size, orientation, number of copies, and telling the
    printer to print the document). The `IScan` interface can give access to the behavior
    of scanning a sheet of paper (resolution, grayscale or color, and adjustments
    like rotation and cropping). These two interfaces are two different behaviors.
    Client code will use an `IPrint` if it wants to print a document or an `IScan`
    interface pointer if it wants to scan a document. Such client code does not care
    whether it is a `printer` object that implements the `IPrint` interface or a `printer_scanner`
    object that implements both the `IPrint` and `IScan` interfaces. Client code that

    The idea here is that you have a library with specific functionality that can

    `public` methods, and so if the derived class publicly derives from that class,
    it will also have those methods as `public` methods. This works fine unless the
    functionality requires that the derived class performs some functionality too
    in those methods, in which case the documentation of the library will require
    that the derived class overrides the method, calls the base class implementation,
    and adds their own code to the method to complete the implementation (the base
    class method could be called before, or after the extra derived class code, and
    the documentation would have to specify this). We have seen this used several

    from a base class provided by the library and extending the functionality provided,
    the mixin class provided by the library *is derived from a class provided by the
    developer*. This solves several problems. First, the developer will have to provide
    specific methods as required by the documentation, otherwise the mixin class (which
    will use those methods) will not compile. The compiler is enforcing the rules
    of the class library author to require that the developer using the library provides
    specific code. Second, the methods on the mixin class can call the base class
    methods (provided by the developer) exactly where it needs them. The developer
    using the class library is no longer provided with detailed instructions about
    how their code is developed, other than that, they have to implement certain methods.

    the class is instantiated using this type at compile time. With mixin classes,
    the type passed through a template parameter is the name of a type that will be

    the `IWork` interface an `ISerializable` interface. If the worker object implements

    passing the `ISerializer` interface pointer to the `serialize` method on the worker
    object. It is up to the worker object to determine the information that must be
    serialized. The worker object knows nothing about the `file_writer` class other

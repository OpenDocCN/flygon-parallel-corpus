    you enclose `StreamWriter` and `StreamReader` within `using`, so that you can
    get them, use them, and dispose off them properly. Lastly, because it's common
    to generate an exception, for example when the path cannot be found or similar,
    also, use `try` and `catch` with a message shown to the user to make the application
    look professional. Remember, this will run because we're running the page from

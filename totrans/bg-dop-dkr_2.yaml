- en: In this lesson, we will scale one of the containers we built into a multi-tier
    setup. This will involve splitting the application into different logical sections.
    For example, we could have an application running on a Docker container and the
    application's data in a separate database container; however, both should work
    as a single entity. For this, we will use Docker's tool for running multi-container
    applications. The tool goes by the name `docker-compose`. In summary, `docker-compose`
    is the tool used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

- en: In a Dockerfile, every line describes a layer. The union filesystem used in
    Docker allows different directories to transparently overlay, forming a single,
    coherent filesystem. The foundational layer is always an image which you build
    upon. Each additional line with a command, say, RUN, CMD, and so on, adds a layer
    to it. The advantage of layers is that as long as the layer has not been modified,
    it will not bother building that part of the image. Secondly, as an image is pulled
    from a Docker image registry, it is pulled in layers, therefore mitigating issues
    such as connection cuts during pulling and pushing of images.

    Sometimes, the frontend has the controller (the logical end) and the view layer
    (the dumb end). The styling of the layout and content (Read, HTML, and CSS) is
    the view layer. The content here is managed by the controller.
  prefs: []

    user''s action and/or database changes. Take, for example, an application like
    Twitter: if someone follows you, your data has changed. The controller will pick

    with the application's logic. This includes the code that is manipulating the
    database; that means all queries come from the backend. However, requests come
    from the **frontend**. This happens when a user clicks a button, for example.

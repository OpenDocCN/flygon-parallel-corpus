- en: The main motivation behind creating a cluster of Docker hosts is designing for
    high availability. Most, if not all, clustering and orchestration tools, such
    as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, take advantage of clustering by creating a master-slave
    kind of relationship. This ensures that there is always a node to fall back to
    in case any one node goes down in the environment. While deploying a cluster to
    a cloud provider, there are a couple of technologies you can leverage to ensure
    that your environment is highly available, for example Consul, and also take advantage
    of the native fault-tolerant design of the cloud by deploying masters and nodes
    in separate availability zones.

    In a real-world scenario, cloud services such as Google Cloud Platform and Amazon
    Web Services may have automatic scaling services defined, where a number of replicas
    are created and traffic is distributed across the replicas through a service known
    as **load balancing**. We will dig deeper into that in the next activity. First,
    we understand how scaling works from the basics. The command for scaling the database
    is in the following format:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A load balancer helps in handling and managing requests in an application. In
    cases where an application handles a lot of requests, which could be 1,000 in
    less than 5 minutes, we would need to have multiple replicas and a load balancer
    on our application, specifically the logical (backend) section. The load balancer
    helps distribute requests and prevent overloading of an instance, eventually leading
    to downtime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When deploying to production on a cloud platform such as **Google Cloud Platform**
    or **Amazon Web Services**, you can make use of an external load balancer to route
    requests to your swarm hosts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker Swarm includes a built-in routing service that enables each node in the
    swarm to accept incoming connections to a published port, even if there is no
    service running on the node. `postgres` service uses port `5432` by default.

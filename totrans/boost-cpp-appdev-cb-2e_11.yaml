- en: The main idea of this recipe is to get a segment of memory that is visible to
    all processes and place some data in it. Let's take a look at *step 3*, where
    we retrieve such a segment of memory. Here, `shm1- cache` is the name of the segment
    (different segments differ in names). You may give any names to the segments.
    The first parameter is `boost::interprocess::open_or_create`, which tells that
    `boost::interprocess::managed_shared_memory` must open an existing segment with
    the name `shm1- cache` or construct it. The last parameter is the size of the
    segment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The size of the segment must be big enough to fit the `Boost.Interprocess` library-specific
    data in it. That's why we used `1024` and not `sizeof(atomic_t)`. But actually,
    the operating system rounds this value to the nearest bigger supported value,
    which is usually equal to or bigger than 4 kilobytes.

- en: '*Step 4* is a tricky one, as we are performing multiple tasks at the same time
    here. In part `2` of this step, we find or construct a variable with the name
    `shm1-counter` in the segment. In part `3` of *step 4*, we provide a parameter,
    which is used for the initialization of a variable, if it has not been found in
    *step 2*. This parameter is used only if the variable is not found and must be
    constructed, otherwise it is ignored. Take a closer look at the second line (part
    `1`). See the call to the dereference operator `*`. We are doing it because `segment.find_or_construct<atomic_t>`
    returns a pointer to `atomic_t`, and working with bare pointers in C++ is a bad
    style.'

- en: While switching threads, the OS does a lot of work, so it is not a very fast
    operation. However, with coroutines, you have full control over switching tasks;
    moreover, you do not need to do some OS-specific internal kernel work. Switching
    coroutines is much faster than switching threads, although, not as fast as calling
    `boost::function`.

    in a coroutine task, so there's no need to worry about leaks.

    free resources that are not derived from `std::exception`. You must take care
    to not catch that exception in coroutine tasks.

- en: There is a `Boost.Coroutine` library (without `2` at the end!), that does not
    require a C++11 compatible compiler. But that library is deprecated and has some
    differences (for example it does not propagate exceptions from coroutines). Beware
    of the differences! `Boost.Coroutine` also changed its interface significantly
    in Boost 1.56.

    are high that next C++ standard will have them out of the box.

- en: Coroutines TS differs from `Boost.Coroutine2`! Boost provides **stackful** coroutines,
    which means that you do not need to specially decorate your code with macro/keywords
    to use them. But it also means that Boost coroutines are harder to optimize by
    the compiler and that they may allocate more memory. Coroutines TS provides **stackless**
    coroutines, which means that compiler could precisely compute the required memory
    for a coroutine and even optimize out the whole coroutine. However, this approach
    requires code changes and may be slightly harder to adopt.

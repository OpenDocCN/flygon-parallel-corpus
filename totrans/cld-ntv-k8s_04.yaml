    Kubernetes provides – the Pod. Included is an explanation of the PodSpec YAML
    format and possible configurations, and a quick discussion of how Kubernetes handles
    and schedules Pods. The Pod is the most basic way to run applications on Kubernetes
    and is used in all higher-order application controllers.

    more containers to be started and run by the Kubernetes scheduler on a node. Pods
    have many potential configurations and extensions but remain the most basic way
    to run applications on Kubernetes.

- en: A Pod by itself is not a very good way to run applications on Kubernetes. Pods
    should be treated like fdisposable things in order to take advantage of the true
    capabilities of a container orchestrator like Kubernetes. This means treating
    containers (and therefore Pods) like cattle, not pets. To really make use of containers
    and Kubernetes, applications should be run in self-healing, scalable groups. The
    Pod is the building block of these groups, and we'll get into how to configure
    applications this way in later chapters.

- en: Pods are implemented using Linux isolation tenets such as groups and namespaces,
    and generally can be thought of as a logical host machine. Pods run one or more
    containers (which can be based on Docker, CRI-O, or other runtimes) and these
    containers can communicate with each other in the same ways that different processes
    on a VM can communicate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order for containers within two different Pods to communicate, they need
    to access the other Pod (and container) via its IP. By default, only containers
    running on the same Pod can use lower-level methods of communication, though it
    is possible to configure different Pods with the availability to talk to each
    other via host IPC.

- en: Startup probes provide a benefit greater than simply extending the time between
    liveness or readiness probes – they allow Kubernetes to maintain a quick reaction
    time when addressing problems that happen after startup and (more importantly)
    to prevent slow-starting applications from restarting constantly. If your application
    takes many seconds or even a minute or two to start up, you will have a much easier
    time implementing a startup probe.

- en: '`successThreshold` is just what it seems, the opposite side of the coin to
    `failureThreshold`. It specifies how many successes in a row are required before
    a container is marked `Ready`. For applications that can go up and down on startup
    before stabilizing (like some self-clustering applications), changing this value
    can be useful. The default is `1`, and for liveness probes the only possible value
    is `1`, but we can change the value for readiness and startup probes.'

    container. A successfully executed command will result in a passed probe, while
    a command that fails will result in a fail on the probe. All the probes we've
    configured so far have used the `exec` method, so configuration should be self-evident.
    If the chosen command (with any arguments specified in comma-separated list form)
    fails, the probe will fail.

    that will be hit with an HTTP `GET` request. If the HTTP request returns a code
    anywhere between `200` to `400`, it will result in a success on the probe. Any
    other HTTP code will result in a failure.

- en: A common flow is to run `kubectl get pods -w` (the `-w` flag adds a watch to
    the command) and see offending Pods transitioning between `Pending` and `Failed`.
    Typically, what is occurring is that the Pods (and their containers) are spinning
    up and pulling images – which is the `Pending` state since the health checks have
    not yet started.

- en: Once the initial probe timeout (which as we saw in the previous section is configurable)
    elapses, the first probe fails. This can continue for seconds or even minutes
    depending on how high the failure threshold is, with the status still pinned at
    `Pending`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, our failure threshold is reached, and our Pod status transitions to
    `Failed`. At this point, one of two things can happen, and the decision is based
    purely on the `RestartPolicy` on the PodSpec, which can either be `Always`, `Never`,
    or `OnFailure`. If a Pod fails and the `restartPolicy` is `Never`, the Pod will
    stay in the failed status. If it is one of the other two options, the Pod will
    restart automatically, and go back to `Pending`, which is the root cause of our
    never-ending transition cycle.

- en: For a different example, you may see Pods stuck forever in the `Pending` status.
    This can be due to the Pod failing to be scheduled on any node. This could be
    due to resource request constraints (which we will cover in depth later in this
    book, in [*Chapter 8*](B14790_08_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor186), *Pod Placement
    Controls*), or other issues such as nodes being unreachable.

    but the most important to consider (when not delving into the more complex controls
    that Kubernetes lets us use) are Pod priority, node availability, and resource
    availability.

- en: The Kubernetes scheduler operates a constant control loop that monitors the
    cluster for unbound (unscheduled) Pods. If one or more unbound Pods is found,
    the scheduler will use the Pod priority to decide which one to schedule first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the scheduler has decided on a Pod to schedule, it will perform several
    rounds and types of checks in order to find the local optima of a node for where
    to schedule the Pod. The latter rounds of checks are dictated by granular scheduling
    controls, which we'll get into in the [*Chapter 8*](B14790_08_Final_PG_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor186),
    *Pod Placement Controls*. We'll worry about the first couple of checks for now.
  prefs: []

- en: First, Kubernetes checks to see which nodes are even schedulable at the current
    moment. Nodes may be non-functioning or otherwise encountering issues that would
    prevent new Pods from being scheduled.

    nodes match the minimum resource requirement stated in the PodSpec.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point, in the absence of any other placement controls, the scheduler
    will make its decision and assign our new Pod to a node. When the `kubelet` on
    that node sees that it has a new Pod assigned to it, the Pod will be spun up.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we learned that Pods are the most basic building block we have
    to work with in Kubernetes. It's important to have a strong understanding of Pods
    and all their subtleties because all compute on Kubernetes uses Pods as a building
    block. It's probably pretty obvious by now, but Pods are very small, individual
    things that are not very sturdy. Running an application as a single Pod on Kubernetes
    with no controller is a bad decision, and any issue with your Pod will result
    in downtime.

    to run multiple replicas of an application at once.

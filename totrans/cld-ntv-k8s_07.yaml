    provides to allow applications to communicate with each other, and with resources
    outside the cluster. You'll learn about the Kubernetes Service resource and all
    its possible types – ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName – as
    well as how to implement them. Finally, you'll learn how to use Kubernetes Ingress.

    on Kubernetes using resources including Pods, Deployments, and StatefulSets. However,
    many applications, such as web servers, need to be able to accept network requests

    can access a Service or Pod via just its Service (or Pod) name, and the subdomain.

    namespace, the Service can be accessed simply by the DNS name `my-svc`. From outside

    you can access your Service from elsewhere in the cluster. For this reason, ClusterIP
    is a great option for Services that only need to be accessed by other Pods within
    a cluster.

    be accessed from outside the Cluster. When creating a NodePort Service, a ClusterIP
    Service of the same name will automatically be created and routed to by the NodePort,
    so you will still be able to access the Service from inside the cluster. This
    makes NodePort a good option for external access to applications when a LoadBalancer
    Service is not feasible or possible.
  prefs: []

    Node in the cluster on which the Service can be accessed. This port will be in

    port link is to access the Service on our Node IP.

    This is an effective way to ensure that the application can be accessed from any
    Node. When using cloud services, however, you already have a range of tools to

    routed directly to the proper Pods. This is because `nginx-ingress` uses the Service
    selector to get a list of Pod IPs, but does not directly use the Service to communicate
    with the Pods. Rather, the Nginx (in this case) config is automatically updated
    as new Pod IPs come online.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we reviewed the various methods that Kubernetes provides in
    order to expose applications running on the cluster to the outside world. The
    major methods are Services and Ingress. Within Services, you can use ClusterIP
    Services for in-cluster routing and NodePort for access to a Service directly
    via ports on Nodes. LoadBalancer Services let you use existing cloud load-balancing
    systems, and ExternalName Services let you route requests out of the cluster to
    external resources.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, Ingress provides a powerful tool to route requests in the cluster by
    path. To implement Ingress you need to install a third-party or open source Ingress
    controller on your cluster.

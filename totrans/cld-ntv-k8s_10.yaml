- en: This chapter describes the various ways of controlling Pod placement in Kubernetes,
    as well as explaining why it may be a good idea to implement these controls in
    the first place. Pod placement means controlling which node a Pod is scheduled
    to in Kubernetes. We start with simple controls like node selectors, and then
    move on to more complex tools like taints and tolerations, and finish with two
    beta features, node affinity and inter-Pod affinity/anti-affinity.

    – from coordinating and scaling them using deployments, injecting configuration
    with ConfigMaps and Secrets, to adding storage with persistent volumes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout all of this, however, we have always relied on the Kubernetes scheduler
    to put Pods on the optimal node without giving the scheduler much information
    about the Pods in question. So far, we've added resource limits and requests to
    our Pods (`resource.requests` and `resource.limits` in the Pod spec). Resource
    requests specify a minimum level of free resources on a node that the Pod needs
    in order to be scheduled, while resource limits specify the maximum amount of
    resources a Pod is allowed to use. However, we have not put any specific requirements
    on which nodes or set of nodes a Pod must be run.

    to schedule a Pod on, or when to completely prevent Pod scheduling due to a lack
    of the nodes we want. This can be used in several different patterns, but we'll

    We can create our own Pod scheduling strategies that account for failure domains

    fail, all the machines on the rack fail. Thus, we may want to encourage Kubernetes

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Taints and tolerations in Kubernetes work like reverse node selectors. Rather
    than nodes attracting Pods due to having the proper labels, which are then consumed
    by a selector, we taint nodes, which repels all Pods from being scheduled on the
    node, and then mark our Pods with tolerations, which allow them to be scheduled
    on the tainted nodes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, Kubernetes uses system-created
    taints to mark nodes as unhealthy and prevent new workloads from being scheduled
    on them. For instance, the `out-of-disk` taint will prevent any new pods from
    being scheduled to a node with that taint.

- en: When we're dealing with multiple node affinities, there are a few key pieces
    of logic to keep in mind. First off, even with a single node affinity, if it is
    combined with a node selector on the same Pod spec (which is indeed possible),
    the node selector must be satisfied before any of the node affinity logic will
    come into play. This is because node selectors only implement hard requirements,
    and there is no `OR` logical operator between the two. An `OR` logical operator
    would check both requirements and ensure that at least one of them is true – but
    node selectors do not let us do this.

- en: Secondly, for a `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` node affinity,
    multiple entries under `nodeSelectorTerms` are handled in an `OR` logical operator.
    If one, but not all, is satisfied – the Pod will still be scheduled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, for any `nodeSelectorTerm` with multiple entries under `matchExpressions`,
    all must be satisfied – this is an `AND` logical operator. Let''s look at an example
    YAML of this:'

- en: One final thing to note about node affinity is that, as you've probably already
    noticed, neither of the two affinity types allows the same `NoExecute` functionality
    that was available to us in our taints and tolerations settings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    execution` – will add this functionality in a future version. As of Kubernetes
    1.19, this does not yet exist.

    definitions between Pods, rather than defining rules for nodes.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inter-Pod affinity and anti-affinity let you dictate how Pods should run based
    on which other Pods already exist on a node. Since the number of Pods in a cluster
    is typically much larger than the number of nodes, and some Pod affinity and anti-affinity
    rules can be somewhat complex, this feature can put quite a load on your cluster
    control plane if you are running many pods on many nodes. For this reason, the
    Kubernetes documentation does not recommend using these features with a large
    number of nodes in your cluster.

    called `labelSelector` since we are selecting Pods, not nodes. The `matchExpressions`
    functionality is the same as with node affinity, but Pod affinity adds a brand-new
    key called `topologyKey`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`topologyKey` is in essence a selector that limits the scope of where the scheduler
    should look to see whether other Pods of the same selector are running. That means
    that Pod affinity doesn''t only need to mean other Pods of the same type (selector)
    on the same node; it can mean groups of multiple nodes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's go back to our failure domain example at the beginning of the chapter.
    In that example, each rack was its own failure domain with multiple nodes per
    rack. To extend this concept to `topologyKey`, we could label each node on a rack
    with `rack=1` or `rack=2`. Then we can use the `topologyKey` rack, as we have
    in our YAML, to designate that the scheduler should check all of the Pods running
    on nodes with the same `topologyKey` (which in this case means all of the Pods
    on `Node 1` and `Node 2` in the same rack) in order to apply Pod affinity or anti-affinity
    rules.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the label `rack` separates nodes into groups.
  prefs:

    with the label `hunger` and a value of 1 or 2.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Essentially, we are splitting our cluster into topology domains – in this case,
    racks – and prescribing to the scheduler to only schedule similar pods together
    on nodes that share the same topology domain. This is the opposite of our first
    failure domain example, where we wouldn't want pods to share the same domain if
    possible – but there are also reasons that you may want to keep like pods on the
    same domain. For example, in a multitenant setting where tenants want dedicated
    hardware tenancy over a domain, you could ensure that every Pod that belongs to
    a certain tenant is scheduled to the exact same topology domain.

    will induce the scheduler to try its best to schedule the Pod on a node where
    it is or with another node on the same rack that has a Pod running with a `hunger`
    of less than 3\. The `weight` is used by the scheduler to compare nodes – as discussed
    in the section on node affinities – *Controlling Pods with Node Affinity* (see
    `pod-with-node-affinity4.yaml`). In this scenario specifically, the weight of
    `50` doesn't make any difference because there is only one entry in the affinity
    list.

    `requireDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`. We even use all the same syntax

    (a `soft` requirement) that it should attempt to schedule this Pod on a node where
    it or any other node with the same value for the `rack` label does not have any
    Pods running with `hunger` label values of 4 or 5\. We're telling the scheduler
    *try not to colocate this Pod in a domain with any extra hungry Pods*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This feature gives us a great way to separate pods by failure domain – we can
    specify each rack as a domain and give it an anti-affinity with a selector of
    its own kind. This will make the scheduler schedule clones of the Pod (or try
    to, in a preferred affinity) to nodes that are not in the same failure domain,
    giving the application greater availability in case of a domain failure.

    a single topology type, some very unintended behavior can happen.

    of anti-affinity – `requiredOnSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, you cannot just

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kubernetes will only let you use the `kubernetes.io/hostname` label, which essentially
    means that you can only have one topology per node if you're using `required`
    anti-affinity. This limitation does not exist for either the `prefer` anti-affinity
    or either of the affinities, even the `required` one. It is possible to change
    this functionality, but it requires writing a custom admission controller – which

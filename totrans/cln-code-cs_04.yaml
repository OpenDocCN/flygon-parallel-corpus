    and avoid duplication. The ideal method has no parameters and does not modify
    the program's state. Small methods are less prone to exceptions, so you will be
    writing much more robust code that benefits you in the long run as you will have
    fewer bugs to fix.

    as well as how to avoid using more than two parameters. The main reason for reducing
    the number of parameters we have is that they can become hard to read, be a source
    of irritation to fellow programmers, and cause visual stress if there are enough
    of them. They can also be a sign that the method is trying to do too much, or
    that you need to consider refactoring your code.

    by looking at pure functions and immutable data.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A pure function is restricted to only operating on the data that is passed into
    it. As a result, the method is predictable and avoids producing side effects.
    This benefits programmers because such methods are easier to reason about and
    test.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once an immutable data object or data structure has been initialized, the contained
    data values will not be modified. Because the data is only set and not modified,
    you can easily reason about what the data is, how it is set, and what the outcome
    of any operation will be, given the inputs. Immutable data is also easier to test
    as you know what your inputs are and what outputs are expected. This makes writing
    test cases much easier as you don't have so many things to consider, such as object
    state. The benefit of immutable objects and structures is that they are thread-safe.
    Thread-safe objects and structures make for good **data transfer objects** (**DTOs**)
    that can be passed between threads.

    your experience, character, and personality, and your ability to fit in with other
    employees and teams. **Being a good fit in the existing team(s) is a must**. These
    questions are also useful for creating a human connection between you and the
    company and seeing whether there is any compatibility or chemistry between their
    ideal candidate and your education, beliefs, ideas, expectations, culture, and
    so on. Moreover, non-technical questions cover the practical and pragmatic aspects
    of the job as well, such as salary, relocation, medical insurance, work schedule,
    willingness to do overtime, and so on.

- en: '**Don''t detail your experience as a boring list of chronological facts**:
    Choose the most representative projects and achievements and talk about them with
    enthusiasm. Talk about your work with enthusiasm (but don''t look desperate and
    don''t exaggerate), and place your achievements in the context of the team/project.
    For example, avoid saying,... *and I did this and that on my own!* It is better
    to say,*... and I helped my team by doing this and that.* Don''t say,*...I was
    the only one capable of doing that.* Prefer saying*...I was nominated by the team
    to accomplish this delicate task*. If you are in your first job, then talk about
    your school projects (think of your colleagues as your team) and about your independent
    projects. If you have participated in programming contests, then talk about your
    results and experience.'

    *我独自完成了这个和那个！* 最好说，*...我通过做这个和那个来帮助我的团队。* 不要说，*...我是唯一一个能够做到那个的人。* 更好的说法是*...我被团队提名来完成这个棘手的任务*。如果你是第一份工作，那么谈谈你的学校项目（把你的同事看作你的团队）和你的独立项目。如果你参加过编程比赛，那么谈谈你的成绩和经验。'
- en: '**Don''t highlight only the positive things**: Experiences can be positive
    and negative. Talk about what went right, but also about what went wrong. Most
    of the time, the truly valuable lessons come from negative experiences. These
    kinds of experiences force us to go beyond our limits to find solutions. Moreover,
    such experiences are proof of resistance to stress, tenacity, and power of concentration.
    Of course, balance positive and negative experiences and highlight what you''ve
    learned from both sides.'

- en: Since we are talking about a Java position, it's obvious that your favorite
    language is Java. But if such a question arises, then it is meant to reveal whether
    you are Java-addicted or an open-minded person. In other words, the interviewer
    considers that it's hard to work with rigid people who are addicted to one programming
    language and want to use it exclusively in all situations. Being a Java developer
    doesn't mean that you should consider Java for all your tasks and ignore everything
    else. So, a good answer might be, *Obviously, I am a big fan of Java, but I also
    consider it important to pick the best tool for the job. It is absurd to believe
    that Java is the answer to all problems.*

    description; therefore, you know that you want this job. Explain to the interviewer
    the main reasons behind your decision. For example, you could say, *I want to
    become an excellent Java backend developer and your projects are quite challenging
    in this area. I want to be part of the team that works on these projects.* Or,
    you could say, *I want to be part of a major start-up in an important company
    and this looks like a great opportunity for me. I heard that a new team is being
    formed and I would be very excited to be part of it.* Don't omit saying something
    about working in a great team! Most probably, you won't be working alone, and
    being a team player is a major aspect of working in almost any company.

    the interviewer is trying to see whether this position fits with your career goals.
    They seek to understand if you see this position as part of your career path,
    or if you have other reasons (apart from the money) for doing it. It is hard to
    describe a detailed career path, but you could give an answer that shows your
    commitment and motivation to do your job right. For example, you could say, *My
    current goal is to work as a Java backend developer on challenging projects that
    will help me to accumulate more experience. In several years, I see myself involved
    in architecting complex Java applications. Beyond that is too far away to think

    have metrics or deadlines that are hard to achieve. Or, they put a lot of pressure
    and responsibilities on this position. Explain to the interviewer your working
    style and underline indirectly the things that you do not agree with. For example,
    you could point out that you are not open to doing night shifts by saying, *I
    like to start working in the morning with the most difficult tasks, and in the
    second part of the day, I will deal with the planning of the next day.* Or, you
    could point out that you are not open to working on weekends by saying, *I like

- en: '**Don''t cite money as the first argument**: Money is often a good reason to
    change jobs but citing it as the first argument is a dangerous route to take.
    The interviewer may think that all you care about is money. Or, they may think
    that your current employer didn''t raise your salary because you were not valuable
    enough. Sooner or later, they might think, you will want more money and you''ll
    proceed with the approach of looking elsewhere if they cannot offer you the desired
    raise.'

- en: '**Invoke a factor out of your control**: Invoking a factor out of your control
    keeps you in the secure zone. For example, you could say, *My team was assigned
    to a project that required relocation*. Or, you could say, *I was moved... to
    the night shift and I couldn''t adapt my life to this schedule*.'

    to hear a strong argument based on your resume or experience. In this case, stay
    calm and positive and mention why you like this company, why you want to work
    in this company, and what you know about it. Showing your interest (for example,

    as well. Let's see first if my value meets your expectations, and we can negotiate
    after that.* Or, if you must give an answer, then it's better to give a range

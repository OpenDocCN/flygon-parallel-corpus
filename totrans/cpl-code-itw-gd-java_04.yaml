  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The non-technical interview questions are meant to measure the match between
    your experience, character, and personality, and your ability to fit in with other
    employees and teams. **Being a good fit in the existing team(s) is a must**. These
    questions are also useful for creating a human connection between you and the
    company and seeing whether there is any compatibility or chemistry between their
    ideal candidate and your education, beliefs, ideas, expectations, culture, and
    so on. Moreover, non-technical questions cover the practical and pragmatic aspects
    of the job as well, such as salary, relocation, medical insurance, work schedule,
    willingness to do overtime, and so on.

    even if they were initially minded to make an offer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    try to determine right from the start whether your experience and goals make you
    a good candidate for the job in question. It is like saying that the human part
    has priority over the technical part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    try to determine what is the best offer for you. This is like saying that the
    technical part has priority over the human part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Non-technical questions don''t have right or wrong answers**! In these situations,
    the best answers are sincere answers. As a rule of thumb, answer as you feel;
    don''t try to say what the interviewer wants to hear. It''s like a negotiation
    – there will be trade-offs. Don''t forget to be polite and respectful.'

    Don't learn/copy these answers! Try to come up with your own answers and focus
    on what you want to highlight. Shape and repeat the answers at home and be prepared
    when you come in front of the interviewer. Don't rely on your spontaneity; rely
    on sincerity and balance the trade-offs.

    If you don''t have an answer prepared for this question, then you are in trouble.
    Let''s highlight several important aspects meant to help you to prepare an appropriate
    answer:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Don''t detail your experience as a boring list of chronological facts**:
    Choose the most representative projects and achievements and talk about them with
    enthusiasm. Talk about your work with enthusiasm (but don''t look desperate and
    don''t exaggerate), and place your achievements in the context of the team/project.
    For example, avoid saying,... *and I did this and that on my own!* It is better
    to say,*... and I helped my team by doing this and that.* Don''t say,*...I was
    the only one capable of doing that.* Prefer saying*...I was nominated by the team
    to accomplish this delicate task*. If you are in your first job, then talk about
    your school projects (think of your colleagues as your team) and about your independent
    projects. If you have participated in programming contests, then talk about your
    results and experience.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Don''t highlight only the positive things**: Experiences can be positive
    and negative. Talk about what went right, but also about what went wrong. Most
    of the time, the truly valuable lessons come from negative experiences. These
    kinds of experiences force us to go beyond our limits to find solutions. Moreover,
    such experiences are proof of resistance to stress, tenacity, and power of concentration.
    Of course, balance positive and negative experiences and highlight what you''ve
    learned from both sides.'

- en: What is your favorite programming language?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since we are talking about a Java position, it's obvious that your favorite
    language is Java. But if such a question arises, then it is meant to reveal whether
    you are Java-addicted or an open-minded person. In other words, the interviewer
    considers that it's hard to work with rigid people who are addicted to one programming
    language and want to use it exclusively in all situations. Being a Java developer
    doesn't mean that you should consider Java for all your tasks and ignore everything
    else. So, a good answer might be, *Obviously, I am a big fan of Java, but I also
    consider it important to pick the best tool for the job. It is absurd to believe
    that Java is the answer to all problems.*

- en: What do you want to do?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a hard question and your answer can have a lot of interpretations. Be
    sincere and tell the interviewer exactly what you want to do. You read the job
    description; therefore, you know that you want this job. Explain to the interviewer
    the main reasons behind your decision. For example, you could say, *I want to
    become an excellent Java backend developer and your projects are quite challenging
    in this area. I want to be part of the team that works on these projects.* Or,
    you could say, *I want to be part of a major start-up in an important company
    and this looks like a great opportunity for me. I heard that a new team is being
    formed and I would be very excited to be part of it.* Don't omit saying something
    about working in a great team! Most probably, you won't be working alone, and
    being a team player is a major aspect of working in almost any company.

- en: What are your career goals?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Via this question (or its sister, *Where do you see yourself in five years?*),
    the interviewer is trying to see whether this position fits with your career goals.
    They seek to understand if you see this position as part of your career path,
    or if you have other reasons (apart from the money) for doing it. It is hard to
    describe a detailed career path, but you could give an answer that shows your
    commitment and motivation to do your job right. For example, you could say, *My
    current goal is to work as a Java backend developer on challenging projects that
    will help me to accumulate more experience. In several years, I see myself involved
    in architecting complex Java applications. Beyond that is too far away to think
    of right now.*

- en: What's your working style?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This kind of question should ring a bell to you. Most of the time, this question
    is specific to companies that have an uncommon working style. For example, they
    often work overtime or they work on weekends. Maybe they work long shifts or they
    have metrics or deadlines that are hard to achieve. Or, they put a lot of pressure
    and responsibilities on this position. Explain to the interviewer your working
    style and underline indirectly the things that you do not agree with. For example,
    you could point out that you are not open to doing night shifts by saying, *I
    like to start working in the morning with the most difficult tasks, and in the
    second part of the day, I will deal with the planning of the next day.* Or, you
    could point out that you are not open to working on weekends by saying, *I like
    to work hard for 40 hours/week from Monday to Friday. I like to spend weekends
    with my friends.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are asked directly about a specific aspect, then provide a clear answer.
    For example, the interviewer may say, *You know, if you work on weekends, then
    you'll be paid double. What do you say about this?*. Well, think twice, and answer
    as you feel but without leaving room for interpretation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, if you are at your first job then you will not get such a question
    (or its sister,*How and why did you leave your last job?*). But if you had a previous
    role (or you plan the change your current role), then the interviewer will want
    to know why you took this decision. The key here is to detail clear and solid
    arguments without saying anything bad or offensive about your previous company,
    bosses, coworkers, and so on – follow the principle that *if you can't say anything
    nice about someone, don't say anything at all*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Here are some tips that will help you with this question (pay attention to
    how this question is interleaved with the previous one – if the working style
    of this company relates nicely to the style of your current or ex-company, then
    most likely, the same reasons for leaving that job will apply to avoiding this
    job as well):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Don''t cite money as the first argument**: Money is often a good reason to
    change jobs but citing it as the first argument is a dangerous route to take.
    The interviewer may think that all you care about is money. Or, they may think
    that your current employer didn''t raise your salary because you were not valuable
    enough. Sooner or later, they might think, you will want more money and you''ll
    proceed with the approach of looking elsewhere if they cannot offer you the desired
    raise.'

    keeps you in the secure zone. For example, you could say, *My team was assigned
    to a project that required relocation*. Or, you could say, *I was moved... to
    the night shift and I couldn''t adapt my life to this schedule*.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    company does mass layoffs and I don''t want this risk*. Or, you could say, *I
    worked for 5 years in a small company, and now I want to put my experience to
    use in a big company*.'

    in backend technologies.*'

- en: What is your salary history?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, this question is meant to determine a landmark for the new offer.
    If you are satisfied by your current salary, then you can give a number. Otherwise,
    is better to be polite and say that *I don't want to mess things up, and I am
    expecting compensation that is proper for the new position and its requirements.*

- en: Why should we hire you?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a pertinent and slightly offensive question. In most cases, this is
    a trap question meant to reveal your reaction to criticism. If it comes at the
    beginning of the interview, then you should consider it as a misleading formulation
    of the question,*What's your experience?.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If it comes at the end of the interview, then it is quite obvious that the interviewer
    knows very well why the company should hire you, therefore, he doesn't expect
    to hear a strong argument based on your resume or experience. In this case, stay
    calm and positive and mention why you like this company, why you want to work
    in this company, and what you know about it. Showing your interest (for example,
    showing that you've researched the company and visited their website) should be
    flattering for the interviewer, who can then quickly pass to the next question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much money do you want to make?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This question occurs right at the start (for example, in the non-technical phone
    screen) or at the end, when the company is ready to prepare an offer for you.
    When it occurs at the start, it means that whether the interview will continue
    will be based on your answer. If your expectations are beyond the potential offer,
    then most probably the interview will stop here. It is wise to postpone a clear
    answer as much as possible by saying something like, *I don't have a clear number
    in my head. Of course, money is important, but there are other important things
    as well. Let's see first if my value meets your expectations, and we can negotiate
    after that.* Or, if you must give an answer, then it's better to give a range
    of salaries. You should know the common salary range for this position (because
    you've done your homework and you've researched on the internet before the interview),
    therefore, provide a range that fits your expectations and respects your research.

    of how you did in the interview and how badly you want this job. Start by asking
    the interviewer about the range of the offer, what other bonuses are available,
    and what is included in the total compensation package. There are several scenarios
    you have to consider further:'

    Accept it!'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bit more. For example, if you got a range between $60,000 - $65,000, then say
    something like, *I had in mind something pretty similar – more precisely, I will
    be very satisfied if we can go for $65,000 - $70,000.* This will probably help
    you to obtain around $63,000 - $68,000.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Getting an evasive answer**: Instead of getting a range, you can receive
    an evasive answer such as, *We customize the salary depending on the applicant,
    therefore, I need to know your expectations.* In such a scenario, say the higher
    number you have in mind. Most probably, you will not get this offer, but it gives
    you room to negotiate. Be short and direct; for example, say, *I''m expecting
    to $65,000 a year.* You should get around $60,000 or an answer that will disappoint
    you like, *Sorry, but we had a much lower number in mind.* This leads to the next
    section.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Getting a disappointing offer**: In this scenario, try to be very prompt
    and start by expressing your disappointment like, *I have to say that I am very
    disappointed with this offer.* Continue by reiterating your strong skills and
    experience. Try to make clear arguments that support the requested number and
    underline that you do not want anything outlandish. If you are not open to accepting
    this job with these conditions, then finish your response with an ultimatum like,
    *If this is your final word, I cannot accept such an offer.* If the company was
    impressed by you, it''s possible they''d require more time and get back to you
    with another offer. If you''re thinking about accepting the offer, then ask for
    a written agreement for renegotiation in six months for now. Moreover, try to
    squeeze other benefits out of the negotations, such as flexible hours, bonuses,
    and so on.'

    and sell yourself short.- Don't lose time trying to negotiate non-negotiable things.

    any remaining doubts that you may have. You can ask whatever you want, but pay
    attention not to ask something stupid or something that requires a long answer.
    You can ask details about something that the interviewer said but that was not
    very clear, or you can ask for their personal opinion about you. Or, you could
    ask something like, *How did you come to this company? What has been most challenging
    for you?* If you have nothing to ask, then don't ask. Simply say something like,
    *Well, I have to say that you've answered all my important questions. Thank you

    can face in an interview. These questions should be seriously trained for before
    the interview because they represent an important part of a successful interview.
    It's true that great answers to these questions will not bring you an offer alone,
    without a solid demonstration of the required technical knowledge, but they can
    impact your salary offer, your daily job expectations, your working style, and
    career goals. Therefore, don't go unprepared to such an interview.

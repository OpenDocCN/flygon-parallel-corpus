    of false positives. What do you recommend for us?* Most probably, the expected
    answer is something like, *I will consider algorithms from the Bloom filters family*.

    but comprehensive way, and communicated with confidence in yourself. A common
    mistake of shy people is to provide an answer that sounds like a question. Their
    tone is like they’re asking for confirmation for every word. When your answer

    don’t know. Try to ask the interviewer for more details and/or a 20-second thinking
    time period. Sometimes, this will help you provide an incomplete but decent answer.
    For example, the interviewer may ask you, *What is the main difference between
    checked and unchecked exceptions in Java*? If you don’t know the difference, then
    you can give an answer such as, *The checked exceptions are subclasses of Exception,
    while the unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException*. You didn’t
    actually answer the question, but it is better than saying, *I don’t know*! Alternatively,
    you could formulate a question such as, *Are you referring to the exceptions that
    we are forced to catch?* By doing this, you may get more details from the interviewer.
    Pay attention and don’t ask it like, *Are you referring to the exceptions that
    we are forced to catch and to the exceptions that we are not forced to catch?*
    You will probably receive a short answer, such as *Yes*. This doesn’t help you!On
    the other hand, if you really have no clue about the answer/solution, then it
    is better to say, *I don’t know*. This is not necessarily a strike against you,
    while trying to baffle the interviewer with too much gobbledygook will definitely
    be against you.

    questions as possible. If you don’t know a question, then move on to the next

    and forward between the questions. In such a case, when you don’t know the answer
    to a question, you are forced to risk it and try to guess an answer. Spending
    a lot of time answering a single question will result in a poor score at the end.
    Ideally, you should try to spend the same amount of time on each question. For
    example, if you have 20 questions to answer in 30 minutes, then you can allocate
    30/20 = 1.5 minutes to each question.

    are not easy! Most probably, you’ll be asked to code a method or a class, but
    this doesn’t mean that it will be easy. Commonly, they require all kinds of tricks,
    they are brain-teasing, and/or they exploit less well-known features of the programming

    clear clauses that prohibit the usage of common solving paths. For example, you
    may receive a problem that sounds like this: *Write a method that extracts a substring
    of a string between the given positions without using a built-in method such as
    String#substring().* There are countless examples like this one. Simply choose
    one or more built-in Java methods (for example, utility methods) that can be implemented
    in a relatively short amount of time and formulate it; for example, *Write a method
    that does X without using a built-in solution such as Y*. Exploring API source

    useful for solving such problems.'

    coding challenge is not a programming contest. The interviewer wants to see you
    during the entire process in order to analyze your behavior and communication
    skills. They want to see whether you have a plan to solve the problem, whether
    you act in an organized or chaotic way, whether you write ugly code, whether you
    are willing to communicate your actions, or whether you are introverted. Moreover,
    they want to assist and guide you. Of course, you need to strive for no guidance

    your command and control sessions. However, most law enforcement agencies use
    VPS servers for their command and control software, which is good since they introduce
    proxy tunnels within their endpoints. It is also another reason that law enforcement
    agents may not use Metasploit since it is trivial to add proxies between you and
    your targets.

    attacker to hijack the search order of DLLs loaded by a program and will enable
    them to insert a malicious DLL instead of a legit one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Mostly, software, once executed, will look for DLL files in its current folder
    and `System32` folder. However, sometimes the DLLs, which are not found in its
    current directory, are then searched in the `System32` folder instead of directly
    loading them from `System32` first-hand. This situation can be exploited by an
    attacker where they can put a malicious DLL file in the current folder and hijack
    the flow which would have otherwise loaded the DLL from the `System32` folder.
    Let''s understand this with the help of the following diagram:'

    three DLL files which are xx1, xx2, and xx3\. However, it also searches for a
    `yy1.dll` file which is not present in the directory. Failure to find `yy1.dll`
    in the current folder means the program will jump to `yy1.dll` from the `System32`
    folder. Now, consider that an attacker has placed a malicious DLL file named `yy1.dll`
    into the application''s current folder. The execution will never jump to the `System32`
    folder and will load the maliciously planted DLL file thinking that it''s the
    legit one. These situations will eventually present the attacker with a beautiful-looking
    Meterpreter shell. So, let''s try this on a standard application such as a VLC

    DLL file. To overcome this problem, we will use the backdoor factory tool to backdoor
    an original DLL file and use it instead of a plain Meterpreter DLL. This means

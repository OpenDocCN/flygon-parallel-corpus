- en: C# is a powerful and versatile Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language that
    can unlock a variety of career paths. But, as with any programming language, learning
    C# can be challenging. With a wide range of different resources available, it's
    difficult to know where to start.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's where *The C# Workshop* comes in. Written and reviewed by industry experts,
    it provides a fast-paced, supportive learning experience that will quickly get
    you writing C# code and building applications. Unlike other software development
    books that focus on dry, technical explanations of the underlying theory, this
    workshop cuts through the noise and uses engaging examples to help you learn how
    each concept is applied in the real world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you work through the book, you'll tackle realistic exercises that simulate
    the types of problems software developers work on every day. These mini-projects
    include building a random-number guessing game, using the publisher-subscriber
    model to design a web file downloader, creating a to-do list using Razor Pages,
    generating images from the Fibonacci sequence using async/await tasks, and developing
    a temperature unit conversion app that you will then deploy to a production server.

    to advance your career and tackle your ambitious projects with C#.

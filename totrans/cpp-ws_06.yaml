    using SQL and C#. You will learn about the Entity Framework (EF), and Object-Relational
    Mapper (ORM) and use them to convert database results into C# objects. You will
    then learn about the main performance pitfalls of SQL and EF and how to find and
    fix them.

    by looking at Repository and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) patterns
    and also by setting up a local database for development and testing. By the end
    of this chapter, you will be able to create and design your own database using
    PostgreSQL Server and use EF to hook a C# backend to it.

    and the language for managing relational databases is SQL. SQL is optimized for
    data persistence. However, executing business rules in it is inefficient. Therefore,
    before consumption, data is often fetched in application memory and transformed
    into objects. This transformation is called object-relational mapping.

- en: Working with a database from any other language comes with an interesting problem
    and that is, how do you convert table rows into C# objects? In C#, communicating
    with a database requires a database connection and SQL statements. Executing the
    statements will bring up a results reader, which is very similar to a table. Using
    the results reader dictionary, you can go through the results and map them into
    a new object.

    For now, it is enough to know that the preceding snippet returns all rows from
    the `factory.product` table and maps the results to a list named `products`. Using
    this approach may be okay when working with a single table, but when joins are
    involved, it becomes tricky. Mapping from one type to another, as has been done
    here, is very granular and can become tedious. In order to run this example, go

- en: A simple yet effective way to solve the problem of accepting any kind of user
    input is to use an ORM as it allows you to convert database tables into C# objects
    and vice versa. In the .NET ecosystem, the three ORMs most commonly used are EF,
    Dapper, and NHibernate. Dapper is effective when top performance is needed because
    working with it involves executing raw SQL statements. Such ORMs are called micro-ORMs
    because they just do the mapping and nothing else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NHibernate originated with the Java ecosystem and was one of the first ORMs
    in .NET. NHibernate, just like EF, solves a bigger problem than micro-ORMs by
    trying to abstract away SQL and database-related low-level details. Using a full-fledged
    ORM, such as EF or Nhibernate, often means that you don't need to write SQL to
    communicate with a database. In fact, the two ORMs allow you to generate complex
    databases out of the objects you have. The opposite is also possible (that is,
    you can generate objects out of databases you already have).

    requires knowledge of SQL and you want to make use of a simplified syntax. Why
    not NHibernate? Because NHibernate is old, it has too many configuration options,
    none of which are useful for getting started with ORMs.

    requirements the best. EF was first released in 2008\. At that time, there was
    no .NET Core and C# was for **Windows only** and strictly required .NET Framework.
    Currently, the latest major version of EF is 6 and it's likely that there won't

    Core 1 (a rework of EF 6).

    EF 6 has a richer set of features. However, EF Core is quickly catching up and
    is likely to soon be ahead. If your project's specifications do not require working

    worth mentioning what you selected. The `select new {...}` means that you create

    to later use this to return a strongly typed object that you need. Therefore,
    after a `ToList` method, you are likely to perform another `select` operation
    to map the results for the final return. You cannot do the mapping right away
    because before you do `ToList`, you are still working with an expression that

    talk with them. On top of that, another language (C#, in this case) is most often
    used to connect to a database to execute SQL queries. If not controlled, C# gets
    mixed with SQL, and it causes a mess of your code. Over the years, there have
    been a few patterns refined to implement the communication with a database in
    a clean way. Two such patterns, namely, Repository and CQRS, are commonly used

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that a `Create` method in this case returns an integer. Usually, when writing
    code, you would segregate methods that change a state from those that query something.
    In other words, do not try to both get something and change something. However,
    in this case, it is difficult to achieve because the ID of an entity will be generated
    by the database. Therefore, if you want to do something with the entity, you will
    need to get that ID. You could instead return the whole entity, but that is like
    getting a house when all you need is an address.

    flawed. So, should you be able to persist any class? In that case, it would be
    nice to mark the classes that you could persist in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, you can do that. When talking about a repository, you should realize that
    even if something is supposed to be saved in a database, that does not mean that
    it will be saved separately. For example, contact information will always be saved
    with a person. A person can exist without contact information but contact information
    cannot exist without a person. Both person and contact information are entities.
    However, a person is also an aggregate (that is the entity that you will be targeting
    when adding data to a database), and it can exist by itself. This means that it
    makes no sense to have a repository for contact information if storing it would
    violate data integrity. Therefore, you should create a repository not per entity,
    but per aggregate.

    because it is just a simple example and there will not be much data; but in real
    applications, it is usually either an integer or a GUID. Sometimes, an ID could
    even be both. In those cases, a consideration to make an entity interface generic
    (that is, taking generic `TId`) could be made.

    unique database name, thus ensuring isolation between the new test databases.
    If you don't use this argument, you risk affecting a context under the test state.
    You want to avoid that for testing scenarios. When it comes to testing, starting
    with a fresh state is the right way to go.

    simple enough to interact with a database and another layer of abstraction is
    not always justified. After all, one of the key reasons why the Repository pattern
    caught so much attention is that it allows you to escape database interactions.
    However, the EF in-memory provider allows that too, so there is even less of a
    reason to use a repository.
  prefs: []

- en: The generic repository pattern is a useful abstraction. It abstracts away database
    interaction under a simple interface. However, for non-trivial scenarios, you
    are likely to need your custom CRUD operations and then you would create a non-generic
    repository. In fact, non-generic repositories are the recommended approach (given
    you want to implement the pattern) because you rarely want all the CRUD methods
    for all the entities. It is not rare to end up with as little as a single method
    on a repository. If you use a generic repository, you could still make all methods
    virtual and override them, but then you will end up overriding all the time or
    having methods that you don't use. It is less than ideal.

    Should the fact that a column type changed, or another column was added affect
    the business logic? There is no straight answer to that. It all depends on the
    project scope, the resources, and the team's maturity. However, if you are working
    on a medium or a big project, you should consider segregating the database and
    domain completely. This does not only mean that different logic should be placed

- en: It is okay for a database layer to consume a domain layer, but it is not okay
    for the domain layer to do the same. If you want a complete separation between
    the two, you will have to introduce an anti-corruption layer. It is a concept
    that says not to consume foreign models and instead map them as soon as they hit
    the public component of that layer. The idea is that all interfaces should be
    domain-specific (that is, work with domain models). However, for a database communication
    implementation, internally, you will be working with database entities instead
    of domain models. This requires mapping one to another (when taking input or returning
    output).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    scope is not worth the effort and you might not see any benefit.

    they take security into consideration and protect you from SQL injection. However,
    the way you connect to a database (that is, the connection string) has to be secured,

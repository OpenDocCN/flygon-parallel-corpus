    to Web APIs. You will interact with Web APIs in a variety of ways using a web
    browser, your own HTTP client, and NuGet packages. You will learn the basics of
    security involved in Web APIs, use PayPal to make sandbox payments, and explore
    cloud services such as Azure Text Analytics and Azure Blob storage.

    messages, make calls to any Web API, and create your own HTTP client to simplify
    your work with complex APIs. You will also be able to dissect and learn both incoming
    HTTP requests and outgoing HTTP responses in any form and use development tools
    in the Chrome browser to inspect traffic moving back and forth when browsing your

    (XML, JSON, HTML, MP3, JPG, etc.) accessible through Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs). A document in the context of the web is often called a resource. Some
    resources do not change. They are stored somewhere, and with every request, the
    same resource will be returned. Such resources are called static. Other resources
    are dynamic, which means they will be generated on demand.

    documents, you use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Hypertext is a special
    text that holds a link to a resource on the web. Clicking on it opens the resource
    it points to. HTTP is based on a client-server architecture. In simple terms,
    a client sends requests, and the server responds. An example of this in practice
    is the communication between a browser (client) and a website (hosted on a server).
    Usually, a single server serves many clients:'

    can call some functionality using code. It could be a class or an interface in
    C#, or a browser (you can interact with it through code provided by its own interface),
    but in the context of HTTP, it is a web service. A web service is an API hosted
    on a remote machine that is accessible through HTTP. An access point used to invoke
    a single piece of functionality on a Web API is called an endpoint. The most commonly

    it. A typical example of this is a three-tier architecture, where you separate
    presentation, business logic, and the data store. From a practical point of view,
    this means that a RESTful API (business logic layer) should not send HTML as a
    response because the responsibility for rendering output lies with the client
    (the presentation layer).

    The two might be confused because HTTP constraints heavily overlap with REST constraints
    (methods, headers, etc.). However, a RESTful API does not have to use HTTP to
    be RESTful, and at the same time HTTP can violate REST constraints by using a
    session or query parameters to provide actions to perform. A RESTful API can work
    with both XML and JSON data formats. However, almost all scenarios involve JSON.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`HttpClient` implements the `IDisposable` pattern. In general, right after
    you are done using an object that implements `IDisposable`, you should clean up
    and call the `Dispose` method or wrap the calls within a `using` block. However,
    `HttpClient` is special in that you should not frequently create and dispose of
    it all over again. The problem with disposing and re-initializing `HttpClient`
    is that `HttpClient` manages connections it makes to other APIs and disposing
    of `HttpClient` does not properly close those connections (or sockets).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most dangerous part about that is that you will not notice any difference
    in developing your application locally, due to the massive number of connections
    available. However, when deploying an application to a live environment, you risk
    running out of free socket connections. Once again, avoid calling a `Dispose`
    method and reinitializing `HttpClient`. If you must, use `HttpClientFactory`.
    Not only does `HttpClientFactory` manage the lifetime of socket connections by
    managing `HttpClientMessageHandler` (the component responsible for sending the
    HTTP request and receiving the response) but it also provides logging capability,
    allows centralized management of clients' configuration, supports injecting middleware
    to clients, etc. The mentioned benefits are important if you use `HttpClient`
    in an enterprise setting. You can learn more about `HttpClientFactory` in *Chapter
    9*, *Creating API Services*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, you should have one static `HttpClient`, which you can reuse for calls
    to Web APIs throughout your application. However, you should not have a single
    `HttpClient` for everything. The point about not disposing of `HttpClient` and
    having a static one is not a hard rule. If you call many different APIs, they
    will have their own base addresses, mandatory headers, and so on. Having a single
    object for all is not a viable scenario.

    only worked with text so far. So, will calling an API with an image be any different?
    Find that out in the next activity.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Azure Blob Storage is a cloud service on Azure for storing different files (logs,
    images, music, and whole drives). Before you can use any Azure Storage services,
    you will need a storage account. Blobs are just files, but they cannot be directly
    stored within an account; instead, they need a container.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Azure Storage Container is like a directory where other files are stored.
    However, unlike a directory, a container cannot contain other containers. Use
    an Azure Storage Account to create two containers, upload an image and a text
    file, and then download the uploaded files locally. All this will be done in your
    own client, which wraps around the Azure Blob storage client.

    Therefore, even when there is a solution for some problem given to you, you will
    often still need to further abstract it away, adapting it to solve exactly the
    problem you have. The problem you had was in uploading and downloading a file
    from and to a specific folder. To solve the problem, you abstracted away layers
    of clients exposing just two functions—one for uploading a file and another for
    downloading a file.

- en: No matter the kind of programmer you are, there will be many scenarios in which
    you will have to consume a web service. There are different kinds of services
    online, but the most common type is RESTful. REST is just a set of guidelines
    and should therefore not be mixed up with HTTP. REST APIs are simple, self-documented,
    well-structured, and are currently a golden standard of Web APIs. However, in
    most cases in the context of RESTful APIs, a request is sent over HTTP and your
    message contains JSON.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main tool for making HTTP calls using C# is `HttpClient`, however, before
    you try to implement HTTP calls yourself, you should look for a NuGet package
    of the Web API you're trying to consume. Azure Blob storage, Azure Text Analytics,
    PayPal, and GitHub are just a few examples of Web APIs.

    done for you. It's not hard to consume; all you need to know now is how to communicate
    with the third-party RESTful Web APIs. In the next chapter, you will learn how
    to create your own RESTful web services using the ASP.NET Core Web API template
    as well as being introduced to Azure Functions and the special tools Swagger and
    NuGet.

    many configuration variants. Thus, choosing a proper data structure is not an
    easy task, which could have a significant impact on the performance of the developed
    solution. Even the topics mentioned in this book form quite a long list of described
    data structures. For this reason, it is a good idea to classify them in some way.

- en: Within this chapter, the described data structures are grouped into linear and
    non-linear categories. Each element in a linear data structure can be logically
    adjacent to the following or the previous element. In the case of a nonlinear
    data structure, a single element can be logically adjacent to numerous others,
    not necessarily only one or two. They can be freely distributed throughout the
    memory.

    You can use this data structure to store many variables of the same type, such
    as `int`, `string`, or a user-defined class. The important assumption is that
    the number of elements in an array cannot be changed after initialization. Moreover,
    arrays belong to random access data structures, which means that you can use indices
    to get access to the first, the middle, the *n*-th, or the last element from the
    array. You can benefit from a few variants of arrays, namely single-dimensional,
    multi-dimensional, and jagged arrays, also referred to as an array of arrays.

    used this data structure many times. In this book, you have seen how you can use
    it to store various data, such as the names of months, the multiplication table,
    or even a map of a game. In the last case, you created a two-dimensional array

    list. The first data structure makes it possible to easily navigate from one element
    to the next using the `Next` property. However, it can be further expanded by
    adding the `Previous` property to allow navigating in forward and backward directions,
    forming the double-linked list. In the circular-linked list, the `Previous` property
    of the first node navigates to the last one, while the `Next` property links the
    last node to the first. It is worth noting that there is a built-in implementation
    of the double-linked list (`LinkedList`), and you can quite easily extend the
    double-linked list to behave as the circular-linked list.

    you can only add a new element at the top (the push operation) and get an element
    by removing it from the top (the pop operation). For this reason, a stack is consistent

  zh: 最后的话
- en: You have just reached the end of the last chapter of the book. First, the classification
    of data structures has been presented, taking into account linear and non-linear
    data structures. In the first group, you can find arrays, lists, stacks, and queues,
    while the second group involves graphs, trees, heaps, as well as their variants.
    In the following part of this chapter, the diversity of applications of various
    data structures has been taken into account. You have seen a short summary of
    each described data structure, as well as information about some problems which
    can be solved with the use of a particular data structure, such as a queue or
    a graph. To make the content easier to understand, as well as to remind you of
    the various topics from the previous chapters, the summary has been equipped with
    illustrations of data structures.

  zh: 你刚刚到达了这本书的最后一章的结尾。首先，介绍了数据结构的分类，考虑了线性和非线性数据结构。在第一组中，你可以找到数组、列表、栈和队列，而第二组涉及到图、树、堆，以及它们的变体。在本章的后续部分中，考虑了各种数据结构的多样化应用。你已经看到了对每种描述的数据结构的简要总结，以及关于可以用特定数据结构解决的一些问题的信息，比如队列或图。为了使内容更容易理解，并提醒你之前章节中的各种主题，总结中配有数据结构的插图。
- en: In the introduction to this book, I invited you to start your adventure with
    data structures and algorithms. While reading the following chapters, writing
    hundreds of lines of code and debugging, you had a chance to familiarize yourself
    with various data structures, starting with arrays and lists, through stacks,
    queues, dictionaries, and hash sets, ending with trees, heaps, and graphs. I hope
    that this book is only the first step into your long, challenging, and successful
    adventure with data structures and algorithms.

    course of this chapter, you'll learn how to write statements using the grammar
    of C#, as well as being introduced to some of the common vocabulary that you will
    use every day. In addition to this, by the end of the chapter, you'll feel confident
    in knowing how to temporarily store and work with information in your computer's
    memory.

    such as `string` and `int` , and strictly speaking, C# doesn't define any types.

    the platform for C# is .NET, which provides tens of thousands of types to C#,
    including `System.Int32` , which is the C# keyword alias `int` maps to, as well
    as many more complex types, such as `System.Xml.Linq.XDocument` .

    vegetable, or mineral. In C#, every **type** can be categorized as a `class` ,
    `struct` , `enum` , `interface` , or `delegate` . You will learn what these mean
    in *Chapter 6* , *Implementing Interfaces and Inheriting Classes* . As examples,
    the C# keyword `string` is a `class` , but `int` is a `struct` . So, it is best
    to use the term **type** to refer to both.

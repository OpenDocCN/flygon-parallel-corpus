    server side using Microsoft ASP.NET Core. You will learn about building simple
    websites using the ASP.NET Core Razor Pages feature introduced with ASP.NET Core
    2.0 and the Razor class library feature introduced with ASP.NET Core 2.1.

    , makes calls over the network using HTTP. As such, HTTP is the technical underpinning
    of the web. So, when we talk about websites and web services, we mean that they
    use HTTP to communicate between a client (often a web browser) and a server.

    first choice of browser for testing your websites. Always test your web application
    with Chrome and at least two other browsers, for example, Firefox and Safari for
    macOS and iPhone. Microsoft Edge switched from using Microsoft''s own rendering
    engine to using Chromium in 2019, so it is less important to test with it. If
    Microsoft''s Internet Explorer is used at all, it tends to mostly be inside organizations

    in all areas of .NET development. Those recommendations are still very much applicable

    in September 2021 that they would not be able to meet that target. They need another
    six months to make sure it meets quality and performance expectations. You can

    conference in May 2022\. Before then, the team will release monthly previews.
    Although I cannot make promises, I hope to post updates to the .NET MAUI chapter
    using those previews on the GitHub repository for this book, or at least an update
    using the final GA release.

    with the release of .NET 7.0 in November 2022\. While I do not expect major new
    features at the level of Blazor or .NET MAUI, I do expect .NET 7.0 to make worthwhile
    improvements to all aspects of .NET.

- en: It has become almost a habit for many developers to use `System.String` to store
    sensitive information such as passwords. The problem with this approach is that
    `System.String` is immutable. This means that the object created in memory by
    `System.String` can't be changed. If you modify the variable, a new object is
    created in memory. You also cannot determine when the object created by `System.String`
    will be removed from memory during garbage collection. Conversely, using the `SecureString`
    object, you will encrypt sensitive information and, when that object is no longer
    needed, it is deleted from memory. `SecureString` encrypts and decrypts your sensitive
    data in unmanaged memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, I need to be clear regarding one thing here. `SecureString` is by no means
    foolproof. If your system contains a virus with the sole purpose of compromising
    the `SecureString` operations, using it doesn't help much (be sure to use proper
    anti-virus software anyway). At some point during the code execution, the string
    representation of your password (or sensitive information) is visible. Secondly,
    if a hacker somehow found a way to inspect your heap or log your key strokes,
    the password might be visible. The use of `SecureString`, however, makes this
    window of opportunity for a hacker much smaller. The window of opportunity reduces
    because there are less attack vectors (points of entry for a hacker) thereby reducing
    your attack surface (sum of all points of attack by a hacker).

    Vulnerable in-line SQL exposes the database to a SQL injection attack. A SQL injection
    attack is where an attacker modifies SQL statements via a web form input box to
    produce a different result than originally intended. This is usually attempted
    on a form where the web application is supposed to access the database to authenticate
    the user login. By not sanitizing the user input, you are exposing your data to
    exploits such as this.

    Having said that, I generally avoid using `sp_` as a prefix to my stored procedures.
    There are a lot of opinions on the Internet as to why this is a bad idea. It is
    generally believed that using `sp_` as a stored procedure prefix impacts on performance

    all the column values, then it is better to explicitly list the columns by name
    instead of just getting all. Using `SELECT *` returns unnecessary columns and
    increases the overhead on the server. This does make a difference in the bigger
    scheme of things, especially when the database starts getting a lot of traffic.
    The thought of having to type out the column names for a large table is definitely
    not something I would look forward to. You can, however, use the following tricks
    to make it easy for you to add the column names to your SQL `SELECT` statement.
    You can right-click on the database table and select Script Table As to create
    one of several SQL statements. Secondly, you can expand the `Table` node and expand
    the table you wish to write the statement for. You will then see a node called
    `Columns`. Drag the `Columns` node onto the query editor. That will insert all
    the column names into the query editor for you.

- en: There are many tools on the market that do this and much more, allowing developers

    on the fly while you are stepping through your code as per your normal debugging
    tasks. It is, in my opinion, an indispensable debugging tool.

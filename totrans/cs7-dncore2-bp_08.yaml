    is my reason why. Liking tweets has lately become a shorthand way for someone
    to let another person know that they have seen their tweet. This is especially
    true when you are mentioned in a tweet. Instead of just replying (especially to
    rhetorical questions), Twitter users simply like the tweet.

    mine to `10`, so this should only contain 10 tweets. For every tweet in the feed,
    I extract the URL of the tweet and add it to a list of type `TweetItem` (the class
    we created earlier). If everything runs smoothly, I route to the `HomeTimeline`

    you will remember that we routed to a view called `HomeTimeline`. We have already

    in our home timeline.

    In this chapter, we saw how to register our application on Twitter's Application
    Management console. We saw that we could easily add Twitter functionality to our
    ASP.NET Core MVC app by using a NuGet package called Tweetinvi. We had a look
    at routing as well as controllers, models, views, and storing the settings in
    the `appsetting.json` file.

- en: In this chapter, we will learn about the OpenStack project for managing containers,
    Zun. Zun is the only solution available in OpenStack that allows its users to
    manage their application containers, backed by different technologies with the
    goodness of other OpenStack components such as Cinder, Glance, and Neutron. Zun
    provides a strong platform for running containerized applications on top of OpenStack
    IaaS.

- en: Zun is an OpenStack service started in the Mitaka cycle developed by the members
    of the Magnum team. A decision was made at the OpenStack Austin Summit in 2016
    to create a new project to allow for the management of containers and let the
    Magnum Container Infrastructure Management service manage only the infrastructure
    for running containers. The result was the Zun project.

- en: Zun is a container management service for OpenStack that provides APIs to manage
    containers abstracted by different technologies at the backend. Zun supports Docker
    as the container runtime tool. Today, Zun integrates with many OpenStack services
    such as Neutron for networking, Glance for managing container images, and Cinder
    for providing volume to the containers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Containers
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The container is the most important resource in Zun. A container in Zun represents
    any application container run by the users. A container object stores information
    such as the image, command, workdir, host, and so on. Zun is an extendable solution;
    it can support other container runtime tools as well. It has a driver-based implementation
    for each tool. The Docker driver in Zun manages containers via Docker. Containers
    in Zun support many advanced operations including CRUD operations such as create,
    start, stop, pause, delete, update, kill, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Images
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Images in Zun are container images. These images are managed either by Docker
    Hub or Glance. Users can download the image and save them to Glance prior to container
    creation to save time. An image object stores information such as the image name,
    tag, size, and so on. Operations supported for images are upload, download, update,
    and search images.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Services
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A service in Zun represents the `zun-compute` service. Zun can have multiple
    instances of `zun-compute` services running to support scalability. This object
    is used to establish the state of the compute services running in the Zun cluster.
    A service stores information such as the state, enabled or disabled, last known
    time, and so on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hosts
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A host in Zun represents the compute node's resources. The compute node is the
    physical machine where the containers run. This is used to establish the list
    of available, used resources in Zun. A host object in Zun stores useful information
    about a compute node such as total memory, free memory, total number of running,
    stopped, or paused containers, total CPUs, free CPUs, and so on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Capsules
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A capsule in Zun represents a composition unit which contains multiple containers
    and other related resources. Containers in a capsule share resources among themselves
    and are tightly coupled to work together as a single unit. A capsule object stores
    information such as the container list, CPU, memory, and so on.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zun is designed to be an extendable solution for managing containers on top
    of OpenStack. Zun supports Docker to manage containers. It aims to support multiple
    other tools in the future as well, such as Rocket. To support this, Zun has a
    collection of container drivers, which can be implemented with many other runtime
    tools and made available as solutions with Zun. Users can choose to manage their
    containers with their choice of tool.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have learned that Zun can support multiple container runtime tools to manage
    containers. Similarly, it supports multiple image drivers for the managing of
    container images such as Glance driver and Docker driver. The image driver is
    also configurable; users can choose any of the available solutions for their use
    case.

    VM is provided by the network driver in Zun. Zun has a Kuryr driver for managing
    all of the network resources for containers. It supports operations such as creating
    and deleting a network, connecting to and disconnecting a container from a network,
    and so on.

- en: Cinder integration
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zun supports the attaching of persistent storage to the containers which exist
    even after the container exits. This storage can be used to store large amounts
    of data outside the host, which is more reliable if the host goes down. This support
    is enabled in Zun via Cinder. Users can mount and unmount Cinder volumes to their
    containers. The users first need to create the volume in Cinder and then provide
    the volume while creating the container.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Zun supports the creation of multiple containers as a single unit. This unit
    is known as a capsule in Zun. This concept is very similar to pods in Kubernetes.
    A capsule contains multiple containers and all of the related resources such as
    network and storage, tightly coupled. All of the containers in a capsule are scheduled
    on the same host and share resources such as the Linux namespaces, CGroups, and
    so on.

    network resources for the container and provides a communication path for other
    OpenStack resources.

    all of the IaaS resources associated with it, such as ports, IP addresses, volumes,
    and so on. The aim of the sandbox is to decouple the overhead of managing these
    IaaS resources from the application containers. A sandbox can manage single or
    multiple containers and provide all of the needed resources.

    Cinder for providing volume to the containers, and Neutron for the connectivity

    the request for permissions, validate the OpenStack resources including validating
    if the image is present in Docker Hub or Glance, and create a DB object for the
    resource with the input data. The request is forwarded to the compute manager.
    Upon receiving a response from the `zun-compute` service, the `zun-api` service
    returns the response to the user.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scheduler in Zun is not an RPC service. It is a simple Python class which
    applies a filter on the compute nodes and picks up the appropriate node for serving
    the request. The compute manager then passes the request to the selected `zun-compute`
    via an RPC call. The call to `zun-compute` can be synchronous or asynchronous
    depending on the processing time taken by each of the operations. For example,
    the list calls can be synchronous as they are not time-consuming, whereas the
    create requests can be asynchronous.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `zun-compute` service is the main component of the Zun system. It performs
    most of the backend operations, hiding all the complexities. `zun-compute` selects
    an appropriate driver for serving each request and creates the related resources
    for containers, such as network resources. It then passes the request to the driver
    with all the required information. `zun-compute` talks to multiple projects for
    various resources such as Glance for the container images and Neutron for the
    network resources.

    Neutron to ensure the requested network or port is usable. If not, `zun-api` sends
    another request to Neutron to search the available network and creates a new Docker
    network for the container.

- en: In earlier chapters, you learned how you use the Amazon ECS-Optimized Amazon
    Machine Image (AMI) to create ECS container instances and join them to an ECS
    cluster in a few simple steps. Although the ECS-Optimized AMI is great for getting
    up and running quickly, you may want to add additional features to your ECS container
    instances for your production environments, such as adding logging agents or including
    support for HTTP proxies so you can place your ECS clusters in private subnets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you will learn how you can build your own custom ECS container
    instances, using the ECS-Optimized AMI as a base machine image and applying your
    own customizations using a popular open source tool called Packer. You will extend
    the base image to include the AWS CloudWatch logs agent, which enables centralized
    logging from your ECS container instances using the CloudWatch logs service, and
    install a useful set of CloudFormation helper scripts, called cfn-bootstrap, which
    will allow you to run powerful initialization scripts at instance-creation time
    and also provide powerful integration features with CloudFormation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, you will create a first-run script that will allow you to adapt your
    instances to the specifics of your target environment without needing to build
    a new AMI for every application and environment. This script will enable you to
    conditionally enable HTTP proxy support, allowing you to install your ECS container
    instances in more secure private subnets, and will also include a healthcheck
    that will wait until your ECS container instances have registered with their configured
    ECS cluster, before signalling CloudFormation that your instances have been successfully
    initialized.

    volumes, which do not use layered filesystems, are stored on the 8 GB operating
    system partition. This approach generally should be avoided for production use
    cases, and instead you should mount a dedicated volume for storing Docker volumes.'

    will typically want to add the CloudWatch logs agent, which supports logging at
    a system level (for example, Operating system, Docker Engine, and ECS agent logs)
    to the AWS CloudWatch logs service. Another important set of tools you should
    consider installing are the cfn-bootstrap tools, which provide a set of CloudFormation

    depending on the nature of the application. For example, a common security best
    practice is to deploy your ECS container instances into private subnets that have
    no default route attached. This means that your ECS container instance must be
    configured with an HTTP proxy in order to communicate with AWS services such as
    ECS and CloudWatch logs, or any other internet services the ECS container instance
    may rely on. However in some scenarios, using an HTTP proxy may not be feasible
    (for example, consider the ECS container instances that run ECS containers that
    provide the HTTP proxy service for your environment), and rather than build separate
    machine images (one with HTTP proxy enabled and one without an HTTP proxy), you
    can created provisioning scripts that will only run once on instance creation,
    that conditionally enable/disable a desired configuration, such as HTTP proxy
    settings, depending on the target use case.'

    has been built as per your customizations, and you should now terminate the instance
    from the EC2 console. You will notice that it is in an unconfigured state, your
    ECS container instance actually can't do much given the Docker service is disabled,
    and in the next chapter, you will learn how to use CloudFormation to leverage
    the CloudFormation helper scripts you installed into your custom machine image
    to configure your ECS container instances at instance creation and leverage the
    customizations you have created.

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to build your custom ECS container instance
    machine image, using the popular open source tool called Packer. You learned how
    to create a Packer template, and learned about the various sections that make
    up a template including variables, builders, provisioners, and post-processors.
    You were able to inject temporary session credentials required to authenticate
    access to AWS as part of the image build process, using a combination of Packer
    variables, environment variables, and a dash of Make automation.

- en: You successfully introduced a number of build-time customizations into your
    ECS container instance image, including installing CloudFormation helper scripts
    and the CloudWatch logs agent, and ensured the system was configured to run the
    NTP service on startup with the correct time zone. You disabled automatic security
    updates in the cloud-init configuration, which can cause problems if you are using
    an HTTP proxy.

- en: Finally, you created a first-run script designed to configure your ECS container
    instances at instance creation and first boot. This script configures ECS cluster
    membership, enables optional HTTP proxy support, configures the CloudWatch logs
    agent for Docker and ECS agent system logs, and performs a health check to ensure
    your instance has initialized successfully.

- en: In the next chapter, you will learn how to use your custom AMI to build an ECS
    cluster and an associated underlying EC2 autoscaling group, which will help you
    understand the rationale for the various customizations you performed to your
    custom machine image.

    This feature is preferable when we want to optimize Docker image size while running
    Docker images in production environments. To achieve this, a multi-stage `Dockerfile`
    will create multiple intermediate Docker images during the build process and selectively
    copy only essential artifacts from one stage to the other.

    discussed in *Chapter 2, Getting Started with Dockerfiles*, a `Dockerfile` is
    a text file that contains instructions on how to create a Docker image. However,
    it is critical to have minimal-sized Docker images when running them in production
    environments. This allows developers to speed up their Docker containers' build
    and deployment times. In this section, we will build a custom Docker image to

    within the `Dockerfile` for each stage, and each stage will start with a different
    base image. Only the essential files will be copied selectively from one stage

    two `Dockerfiles` and a shell script. In contrast, multi-stage Docker builds will
    need only one `Dockerfile` and do not require any shell script to copy the executables
    between Docker containers. Also, the builder pattern requires that you copy the
    executables to the Docker host before copying them to the final Docker image.

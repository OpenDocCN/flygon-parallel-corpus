    running nodes, deploy services, and perform rolling updates on your services when
    needed. You will learn how to troubleshoot your Swarm nodes and deploy entire
    stacks using your existing Docker Compose files, as well as learning how you can
    use Swarm to manage your service configuration and secrets. The final part of
    this chapter will provide you with the knowledge you need to get started using
    Swarmpit, which is a web-based interface for running and managing your Docker
    Swarm services and clusters.

    they run from the command line using direct commands such as `docker run` to launch
    containers. Our next step is to automate things with the use of Docker Compose,
    which allows an entire environment of containers to work together. Docker Swarm
    is the next step in managing our Docker environments. **Docker Swarm** allows
    you to orchestrate how your containers can scale and work together to provide
    a more reliable service to your end-users.
  prefs: []

- en: Docker Swarm allows you to set up multiple servers running Docker Engine and
    organize them as a cluster. Docker Swarm can then run commands to coordinate your
    containers across the cluster instead of just one server. Swarm will configure
    your cluster to make sure your services are balanced across your cluster, ensuring
    higher reliability for your services. It will also decide for you which service
    will be assigned to which server depending on the load across your cluster. Docker
    Swarm is a step up in terms of managing the way you run your containers and is
    provided by default with Docker.

    while scaling the number of containers up and down depending on the load. You
    can perform rolling updates across your services to reduce the chances of an outage,
    meaning new versions of your container applications can be applied to the cluster
    without these changes causing an outage for your customers. It will allow you
    to orchestrate your container workloads through the swarm instead of manually
    managing containers one by one.

    Having multiple nodes and workers is not compulsory as part of Docker Swarm. You

    to make sure your services are as fault-tolerant as possible.'

    works in the following section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How Docker Swarm Works?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The swarm manager nodes handle cluster management, and the main objective is
    to maintain a consistent state of both the swarm and the services running on it.
    This includes ensuring that the cluster is running at all times and that services
    are run and scheduled when needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As there are multiple managers running at the same time, this means there is
    fault tolerance, especially in a production environment. That is, if one manager
    is shut down, the cluster will still have another manager to coordinate services
    on the cluster. The sole purpose of worker nodes is to run Docker containers.
    They require at least one manager to function, but worker nodes can be promoted
    to being a manager, if needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Services permit you to deploy an application image to a Docker swarm. These
    are the containers to run and the commands to execute inside the running container.
    Service options are provided when you create a service, where you can specify
    the ports the application can publish on, CPU and memory restrictions, the rolling
    update policy, and the number of replicas of an image that can run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The desired state is set for the service, and the manager's responsibility is
    to monitor the service. If the service is not in the desired state, it will correct
    any issues. If a task fails, the orchestrator simply removes the container related
    to the failed task and replaces it.

    with the basic commands and guide you through a hands-on exercise to further demonstrate
    its operation.

- en: The previous section of this chapter has shown you that Swarm uses similar concepts
    to what you have already learned so far in this book. You'll see that the use
    of Swarm takes the Docker commands you are so familiar with and expands them to
    allow you to create your clusters, manage services, and configure your nodes.
    Docker Swarm takes a lot of the hard work out of running your services, as Swarm
    will work out where it is best to place your services, take care of scheduling
    your containers, and decide which node it is best to place it on. For example,
    if there are already three services running on one node and only one service on
    your second node, Swarm will know that it should distribute the services evenly
    across your system.

    allows us to store encrypted values that are then used by our services.

    starting single-image services to a more production-ready and complete environment
    with Docker Swarm. We started this chapter with an in-depth discussion of Docker
    Swarm and how you can manage your services and nodes from the command line, providing
    a list of commands and their use, and later implementing them as part of a new
    environment running a test Django web application.

    functionality to store configuration and secrets data so they no longer need to
    be included as part of our Docker image and can instead be included in the Swarm
    we are deploying. We then showed you how to manage your swarm using your web browser
    with Swarmpit, providing a rundown of the work we previously did on the command
    line and making a lot of these changes from a web browser. Swarm is not the only
    way you can orchestrate your environments when using Docker.

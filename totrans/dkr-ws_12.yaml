    with Docker and your container images. This will enable you to monitor and manage
    the resources used by your container and limit their effect on your host system.
    You will analyze Docker's best practices and learn why it's important to only
    be running one service per container, ensuring that your containers are scalable
    and immutable and making sure that your underlying applications start in a short
    amount of time. This chapter will help you to enforce these best practices by
    linting your `Dockerfiles` and `docker-compose.yml` files before your applications
    and containers are running with the help of `hadolint's` `FROM:latest` command
    and `dcvalidator`.

    and services that have adhered to these best practices. We made sure that our
    images and services were secure and that they limited what could be achieved if
    an attacker was able to access the image. This chapter will not only take you
    through the best practices in creating and running our Docker images, but will
    also focus on container performance, configuring our services, and ensuring that
    the services running on them are running as efficiently as possible.

    that are running on them. Lastly, this chapter will give you some practical tools

    as much as possible to make sure that they run without issues from your development
    environment through to production. The goal of this chapter is to make sure that
    your services are starting up as quickly as possible and are processing as efficiently
    as they can. The practices mentioned in this chapter also ensure reusability (that
    is, they make sure that anyone who wants to reuse your images or code can do so
    and can understand specifically what is happening at all times). To begin with,
    the following section discusses how to work with container resources.

    is that it enables us to heavily reduce the footprint of our services and applications,
    even when moving to production. This doesn't mean we can simply run anything on
    our container, expecting all the processes to simply complete their execution,
    however. Just as we would need resources with a service running on a standalone
    server, we need to ensure that the resources (such as CPU, memory, and disk input
    and output) that are being used by our containers do not cause our production
    environments or any other containers to crash. By monitoring the resources used
    in our development system, we can help optimize processes and ensure that the
    end-user is experiencing seamless operation when we move it into production.

- en: By testing our services and monitoring resource usage, we will be able to understand
    the resources required by the running applications and ensure that the hosts running
    our Docker images have adequate resources to run our service. Lastly, as you will
    see in the upcoming sections, we can also limit the amount of CPU and memory resources
    the container can have access to. When developing our services running on Docker,
    we need to be testing these services on our development system to know exactly
    what will happen when they are moved into test and production environments.

- en: When we bring a number of different services (such as a database, web server,
    and API gateway) together to create an application, some services are more important
    than others, and in some circumstances, these services may need to have more resources
    allocated to them. However, in Docker, the running container does not have a real
    limit on the resources it can use by default.

    which helps in distributing resources across your system, but this part of the
    chapter will teach you about some basic tools to test and monitor your resources
    with. We will also look at the ways in which you can configure your containers
    to no longer use the default resources available.

    will only serve the purpose of demonstrating resource usage in our system. In
    the first part of this section, we will create an image that will add an application
    called stress. The main function of the stress application is to impose a heavy
    load on our system. The image will allow us to view the resources being used on
    our host system and then allow us to use different options when running the Docker
    image to limit the resources being used.

    we display the CPU percentage being used, unless you have a system that only has
    one CPU with one core, you will most likely see more than 100% of the CPU being
    used. For example, if you have four cores in the CPU of your system, and your

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In modern microservice architecture, we need to remember that only one service
    should be installed in each container. The container's main process is set by
    the `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` instruction at the end of the `Dockerfile`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The service you have installed in your container could quite easily run multiple
    processes of itself, but to get the full benefit of Docker and microservices,
    you should only be running one service per container. To break this down further,
    your container should only have a single responsibility, and if it is responsible
    for doing more than one thing, then it should be broken out into different services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By limiting what each container can do, we effectively reduce the resources
    being used by the image and potentially reduce the size of the image. As we saw
    in the previous chapter, this will also reduce the chances of an attacker being
    able to perform anything they shouldn't if they gain access to a running container.
    It also means that if the container stops working for some reason, there is a
    limited effect on the rest of the applications running on the environment and
    the service will have an easier time recovering.

    need to do is to make sure we are starting with an up-to-date image. Do a little
    research as well to make sure you are not using an image that has a lot of extra
    applications installed that are not needed. You may find that a base image supported
    by a specific language that your application uses or a specific focus will limit
    the size of the image needed, limiting what you need to install when you are creating
    your image.

    group of applications that your package manager has recommended and that you won't

    deploying it into your environment. This makes deployments safer as if you have
    any issues with your upgrade, you simply redeploy the old version of the image.

    making sure your environments are as identical as possible.

    cleanly shut down and destroyed at any time, without fearing data loss. When a

    our images, the images can be built faster. They can also then be pulled faster
    and run on our systems. Any unnecessary software or applications installed on

    we can use external service and tests to make sure our Docker images are adhering
    to the best practices. In the following sections of this chapter, we are going
    to use three tools to make sure that our `Dockerfiles` and `docker-compose.yml`
    files are adhering to the best practices, as well as making sure we are not introducing
    potential issues when our Docker images are built.
  prefs: []

    We will start by using `hadolint` to lint our `Dockerfiles` directly on our system,
    which will run as a separate Docker image that we feed our `Dockerfiles` into.
    We then take a look at `FROM:latest`, which is an online service that provides
    some basic functionality in helping us pinpoint issues with our `Dockerfiles`.
    Lastly, we then look at **Docker Compose Validator** (**DCValidator**), which
    will perform a similar function, but in this case, we will lint our `docker-compose.yml`
    files to help pinpoint potential issues.

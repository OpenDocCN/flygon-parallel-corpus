    beyond OOP concepts, with the goal of enabling you to write more robust and extensible
    code. We will begin this endeavor by exploring exception handling in C++. Adding
    language-prescribed methods in our code to handle errors will allow us to achieve
    less buggy and more reliable programs. By using the formal exception handling
    mechanisms *built into the language*, we can achieve uniform handling of errors,
    which leads to more easily maintainable code.

    each programmer would handle errors in their own manner, and sometimes not at

    When a sequence of functions is called, we build up, on the stack, state information
    applicable to each successive function call (parameters, local variables, and
    return value space), as well as the return address for each function. When an
    exception is thrown, we may need to unwind the stack to the point of origination
    where this sequence of function calls (or try blocks) began, resetting the stack
    pointer as well. This process is known as **backtracking** and allows a program
    to return to an earlier sequence in the code. Backtracking applies not only to
    function calls but to nested blocks including nested try blocks.

    in this virtual method, we verify that a `Student` meets admission standards.
    If so, the function ends normally. If not, an exception is thrown. In this example,
    a simple `const char *` is thrown containing the message "`Does not meet prerequisites`".

    we nest our call to `s1.Validate()` within a try block. We are literally saying
    that we'd like to *try* this block of code. Should `Student::Validate()` work
    as expected, error-free, our program completes the try block, skips the catch
    block(s) below the try block, and merely continues with the code below any catch
    blocks.

    code in our try block and seek an exception matching the type of `const char *`
    in a subsequently defined catch block. Here, in the matching catch block, our
    goal is to correct the error if at all possible. If we are successful, our program
    will continue with the code below the catcher. If not, our job is to end the program
    gracefully.

    included and the usual class definition for `Student` defined. We will now augment
    the `Student` class by adding the `Student::Validate()` method (virtual, so that
    it may be overridden) and the `Student::TakePrerequisites()` method (not virtual,
    descendants should use it as-is).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice that our `Student::Validate()` method throws an exception, which is merely
    a string literal containing a message indicating the issue at hand. We can imagine
    the complete implementation of the `Student::TakePrerequisites()` method verifies
    that the `Student` has met the appropriate prerequisites, and returns a Boolean
    value of `true` or `false` accordingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our `main()` function, we now notice a set of nested try blocks. The purpose
    here is to illustrate an inner try block that may call a method, such as `s1.Validate()`,
    which may raise an exception. Notice that the same level handler as the inner
    try block catches this exception. It is ideal that an exception is handled at
    the level equal to the try block from which it originates, so let's assume that
    the catcher in this scope tries to do so. For example, our innermost catch block
    presumably tries to correct the error and tests whether the correction has been
    made using a call to `s1.TakePrerequisites()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But perhaps this catcher is only able to process the exception partially. Perhaps
    there is the knowledge that an outer-level handler knows how to do the remaining
    corrections. In such cases, it is acceptable to re-throw this exception to an
    outer (nested) level. Our simple `throw;` statement in the innermost catch block
    does just this. Notice that there is a catcher at the outer level. Should the
    thrown exception match, type-wise, this outer level will now have the opportunity
    to further handle the exception and hopefully correct the problem so that the
    application can continue. Only if this outer catch block is unable to correct
    the error, the application should be exited. In our example, each catcher prints
    out the string representing the error message; hence this message occurs twice
    in the output.

    the necessity to craft handlers for a variety of data types. Exception handlers
    (that is, catch blocks) can receive an exception of any data type. We can minimize
    the number of catchers we introduce by utilizing catch blocks with base class
    types; we know that derived class objects (related through public inheritance)
    can always be up-cast to their base class type. We can also use the ellipses (`…`)
    in a catch block to allow us to catch anything not previously specified.

    member function. Here, we can imagine that this method runs through many graduation
    requirements, and as such, can potentially raise a variety of different types
    of exceptions. For example, should the `Student` instance have too low of a `gpa`,
    a float is thrown as the exception, indicating the student's poor `gpa`. Should
    the `Student` have too few credits, an integer is thrown, indicating how many
    credits the `Student` still needs to earn their degree.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps the most interesting potential error `Student::Graduate()` might raise
    would be if a required `Course` is missing from a student's graduation requirements.
    In this scenario, `Student::Graduate()` would allocate a new `Course` object,
    filling it with the `Course` name and number via construction. Next, the pointer
    to the `Course` is dereferenced and the object is thrown by reference. The handler
    may then catch this object by reference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `main()` function, we merely wrap the call to `Student::Graduate()` within
    a try block, as this statement may raise an exception. A sequence of catchers
    follows the try block – one `catch` statement per type of object that may be thrown.
    The last catch block in this sequence uses ellipses (`…`), indicating that this
    catcher will handle any other type of exception thrown by `Student::Graduate()`,
    which has not been caught by the other catchers.
  prefs: []

    an exception, the remainder of the try block is ignored. Instead, the program
    continues with a matching catcher (or calls `terminate()` if no suitable catcher
    exists). Then, if the error is repaired, the code beyond the catcher commences.
    Note that we never return to complete the remainder of the initial try block.
    The implication of this behavior is that you should only group together elements
    within a try block that go together. That is, if one item causes an exception,
    it is no longer important to complete the other item in that grouping.

    `Student::Graduate()` includes the `throw` keyword after its parameter list and
    then, as part of this method's extended signature, includes the types of objects

    merely has an empty list following `throw()` in its extended signature. This means
    that `Student::Enroll()` might throw any type of exception.

    like a useful endeavor. In fact, the C++ Standard Library has created one such
    generic class, `exception`, to provide the basis for building an entire hierarchy
    of useful exception classes.

    with the following signature: `virtual const char *what() const throw()`. This
    signature indicates that derived classes should redefine `what()` to return a
    `const char *` with a description of the error at hand. The `const` keyword after
    `what()` indicates that this is a `const` member function; it will not change
    any members of the derived class. The `throw()` in the extended signature indicates
    that this function may throw any type. The usage of `throw()` in the signature
    is a deprecated anachronism.'

    exception classes, including `bad_alloc`, `bad_cast`, `bad_exception`, `bad_function_call`,
    `bad_typeid`, `bad_weak_ptr`, `logic_error`, `runtime_error`, and nested class
    `ios_base::failure`. Many of these derived classes have descendants themselves,
    adding additional standard exceptions to the predefined hierarchy of exceptions.

    may be caught by either catching the base class type, `exception`, or by catching

    generalized base class type or as its specific type.

    able to pack clues into the object (that will be thrown) as to how to correct
    the error at hand. Simply derive your class from the Standard `exception` class.

    notice that we define our own exception class, `StudentException`. It is a derived
    class from the C++ Standard Library `exception` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `StudentException` class contains data members to hold an error code as
    well as alphanumeric details describing the error condition using data members
    `errCode` and `details`, respectively. We have two simple access functions, `StudentException`
    `::GetCode()` and `StudentException::GetDetails()`, to easily retrieve these values.
    As these methods do not modify the object, they are `const` member functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We notice that the `StudentException` constructor initializes the two data members
    – one through the member initialization list and one in the body of the constructor.
    We also override the `virtual const char *what() const throw()` method as introduced
    by the `exception` class. Notice that the `exception::what()` method utilizes
    the deprecated `throw()` specification in its extended signature – this is something
    you must do as well with your overridden method.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, let's examine our `Student::Graduate()` method. This method may throw
    a `StudentException`. If an exception must be thrown, we allocate one using `new()`,
    construct it with diagnostic data, and then `throw` the dereferenced pointer from
    this function (so that we are throwing a referenceable object, not a pointer to
    an object). Note that the object thrown has no local identifier in this method
    – there's no need, as any such local variable name would soon be popped off the
    stack after the `throw` occurred.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our `main()` function, we wrap our call to `s1.Graduate()` within a try block
    and it is followed by a catch block that accepts a reference (`&`) to a `StudentException`,
    which we treat as `const`. Here, we first call our overridden `what()` method
    and then print out the diagnostic details from within the exception, `e`. Ideally,
    we would use this information to try to correct the error at hand and only exit
    the application if truly necessary.

- en: Objects of nested, user defined types may be created and thrown to catchers
    anticipating such types. These nested classes are built into the public access
    region of the outer class, making them easily available for derived class usage
    and specialization. In general, exception classes built into an outer class must
    be public so that the instances of nested types thrown can be caught and handled
    outside the scope of the outer class (that is, in the scope where the primary,
    outer instance exists).

    an exception of the nested class type `Student::StudentException` (which it instantiates
    as needed).

    the inner class type for `err`, the referenced object (that is, `const Student::StudentException

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may wish to create a sub-hierarchy, derived from the Standard Library `exception`,
    of your own exception classes. Be sure to use public inheritance. When utilizing
    these classes, you will instantiate an object of your desired exception type (filling
    it with valuable diagnostic information), and then throw that object. Keep in
    mind, you'll want the newly allocated object to exist on the heap so that it won't
    be popped off the stack when a function returns (so allocate it with `new`). Simply
    dereference this object before throwing it, so that it can be caught as a reference
    to that object, which is standard practice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, if you create a hierarchy of exception types, your catchers can catch
    specific derived class types or more general base class types. The option is yours,
    depending on how you plan to handle the exception. Keep in mind, however, that
    if you have a catcher for both the base and derived class types, place the derived
    class types first – otherwise your thrown object will first match to the base
    class type catcher without realizing that a more appropriate derived class match
    is available.

    beyond OOP concepts, with the continued goal of writing more extensible code.
    We will next explore creating generic code using C++ templates – both **template
    functions** and **template classes**. We will learn how template code, when written
    correctly, is the pinnacle of code reuse. We will explore how to create both template
    functions and template classes, as well as understanding the how appropriate use
    of operator overloading can make a template function reusable for nearly any type
    of data.

- en: Templates allow code to be generically specified in a manner that is abstracted
    from the data types primarily used within relevant functions or classes. The motivation
    for creating templates is to generically specify the definition of functions and
    classes that we repeatedly want to utilize, but with varying data types. The individualized
    versions of these components would otherwise differ only in the core data type
    utilized; these key data types can then be extracted and written generically.

- en: When we then opt to utilize such a class or function with a specific type, rather
    than copying and pasting existing code from a similar class or function (with
    preset data types) and changing it slightly, the preprocessor instead would take
    the template code and *expand* it for our requested, bonified type. This template
    *expansion* capability allows the programmer to write and maintain only one version
    of the genericized code, versus the many type-specific versions of code that would
    otherwise need to be written. The benefit is also that the preprocessor will do
    a more accurate expansion of the template code to a bonified type than we might
    have done using a copy, paste, and slight modification method.

    arrays for the data type `int`, such as what we have created in the solution for
    *Question 3* of [*Chapter 12*](B15702_12_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor453),
    *Operator Overloading and Friends*. Our motivation may be to have an array type
    that can grow or shrink to any size (unlike native, fixed-sized arrays), yet have
    bounds checking for safe usage (unlike the raw manipulation of a dynamic array
    implemented using `int *`, which would unscrupulously allow us to access elements
    well beyond the length of our dynamic array allocation).

    comprising the array using `int *contents;`, which is dynamically allocated to
    the desired size in the constructor. We have overloaded `operator[]` to safely
    return only indexed values in the array that are within the proper range. We can
    add methods to `Resize()` and `ArrayInt` and so on. Overall, we love the safety
    and flexibility of this class.

    class). Rather than copying our baseline `ArrayInt` class and modifying it slightly
    to create an `ArrayFloat` class, for example, we may ask if there is a more automated
    way to make this substitution. After all, what would we change in creating an
    `ArrayFloat` class using an `ArrayInt` class as a starting point? We would change
    the *type* of the data member `contents` – from an `int *` to a `float *`. We
    would change the *type* in the memory allocation in the constructor from `contents
    = new int [size];` to utilize `float` instead of `int` (and similarly so in any
    reallocation, such as in a `Resize()` method).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than copying, pasting, and slightly modifying an `ArrayInt` class to
    create an `ArrayFloat` class, we can simply use a **template class** to genericize
    the *type* associated with the data manipulated within this class. Similarly,
    any functions relying on the specific data type will become **template functions**.
    We will examine the syntax for creating and utilizing templates shortly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using templates, we can instead create just one template class called `Array`
    where the type is genericized. At compile time, should the preprocessor detect
    that we have utilized this class for `int` or `float` type in our code, the preprocessor
    will then provide the necessary template *expansions* for us. That is, by copying
    and pasting (behind the scenes) each template class (and its methods) and substituting
    in the data types that the preprocessor identifies we are using.
  prefs: []

    written the code for each individual class ourselves. But the point is that we
    did not have to tediously create, modify, test, and later maintain each minorly
    different class ourselves. This is done on our behalf by C++. This is the noteworthy
    purpose of template classes and template functions.
  prefs: []

    we may wish to create an `Array` of a user-defined type, such as `Student`. We
    will need to ensure that all of our template member functions are meaningful for
    the data types that we actually expand the template class to utilize. We may need
    to overload selected operators so that our template member functions can work
    seamlessly with user defined types, just as they do with primitive types.

    The preamble `template <class Type1, class Type 2>` indicates that the prototype
    will be a template prototype and that the placeholders `Type1` and `Type2` will
    be used instead of actual data types. The placeholders `Type1` and `Type2` may
    be (nearly) any name, following the rules of creating identifiers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    indicates that the return type from this function will be of `Type2` and that
    the arguments of the `ChooseFirst()` function will be of `Type1` and `Type2` (which
    are certainly allowed to expand to be the same type).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we see the function definition. It, too, begins with a preamble of `template
    <class Type1, class Type 2>`. Similar to the prototype, the function header `Type2
    ChooseFirst(Type1 x, Type2 y)` indicates that formal parameters `x` and `y` are
    of types `Type1` and `Type2`, respectively. The body of this function is rather
    straightforward. We simply determine which of the two parameters should be ranked
    first in an ordering of the two values by using a simple comparison with the `<`
    operator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, in `main()`, when the preprocessor portion of the compiler sees a call
    to `ChooseFirst()` with actual parameters `int value1` and `float value3`, the
    preprocessor notices that `ChooseFirst()` is a template function. If no such version
    of `ChooseFirst()` yet exists to handle an `int` and a `float`, the preprocessor
    copies this template function and replaces `Type1` with `int` and `Type2` with
    `float` – creating on our behalf the appropriate version of this function to fit
    our needs. Notice that when `ChooseFirst(value2, value1)` is called and the types
    are both integers, the placeholder types of `Type1` and `Type2` will both be replaced
    with `int` when the template function is again expanded (under the hood) in our
    code by the preprocessor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though `ChooseFirst()` is a simple function, with it we can see the straightforward
    mechanics of creating a template function that genericizes key data types. We
    can also see how the preprocessor notices how the template function is used and
    takes on the effort on our behalf to expand this function, as needed, for our
    specific type usage.

    of `template <class Type>`. This preamble specifies that the impending class definition
    will be that of a template class and that the placeholder `Type` will be used
    to genericize the data types primarily used within this class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then see the class definition for `Array`. Data member `contents` will be
    of the placeholder type of `Type`. Of course, not all data types will need to
    be genericized. Data member `int numElements` is perfectly reasonable as an integer.
    Next, we see an assortment of member functions prototyped, and some defined inline,
    including the overloaded `operator[]`. For the member functions defined inline,
    a template preamble is not necessary in front of the function definition. The
    only thing we need to do for inline functions is genericize the data type using
    our placeholder, `Type`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's now take a look at selected member functions. In the constructor, we now
    notice that the memory allocation of `contents = new Type [size];` merely uses
    the placeholder `Type` in lieu of an actual data type. Similarly, for the overloaded
    `operator[]`, the return type of this method is `Type`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, looking at a member function that is not inline, we notice that the
    template preamble `template <class Type>` must precede the member function definition.
    For example, let's consider the member function definition for `void Array<Type>::operator+(Type
    item);`. In addition to the preamble, the class name (preceding the member function
    name and scope resolution operator `::`) in the function definition must be augmented
    to include the placeholder type `<Type>` in angle brackets. Also, any generic
    function parameters must use the placeholder type of `Type`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, in our `main()` function, we merely use the data type of `Array<int>` to
    instantiate a safe, easily resizable array of integers. We could have alternatively
    used `Array<float>` had we instead wanted to instantiate an array of floating-point
    numbers. Under the hood, when we create an instance of a specific array type,
    the preprocessor notices if we have previously expanded this class for that *type*.
    If not, the class definition and applicable template member functions are copied
    for us and the placeholder types are replaced with the type that we need. This
    is no fewer lines of code than had we copied, pasted, and slightly modified the
    code ourselves; however, the point is that we only have one version to specify
    and maintain ourselves. This is less error-prone and is easier for long-term maintenance.

    also should notice that each class definition itself contains the same template
    preamble to dually specify that the class will be a template class and that the
    placeholder for the data type will be the identifier `Type`.

    *head;` or the return type of `RemoveAtFront()`, which is `LinkListElement<Type>`.

    for example, `void LinkList<Type>::Print()`.

    of their method to utilize the placeholder type, `Type`. For example, the `InsertAtFront(Type

    parameter `theItem`, and to specify the associated class `LinkListElement<Type>`
    when declaring a local pointer variable `temp`. The `RemoveAtFront()` method similarly
    utilizes a local variable of the type `LinkListElement<Type>`, hence necessitating
    its use as a template function. Similarly, `Print()` introduces a local variable
    of the type `Type` to assist with output.

    will compile without error, as `operator<` has been defined for two `Student`
    objects.

- en: What happens if we neglect to overload `operator<` for a given type, however,
    `OrderedInsert()` (or another method relying on `operator<`) is never called in
    our code on an object of that same expended template type? Believe it or not,
    the code will compile and work without issue. In this case, we are not actually
    calling a function (that is, `OrderedInsert()`) that would require `operator<`
    to be implemented for that type. Because the function is never called, the template
    expansion for that member function is skipped. The compiler has no reason to discover
    that `operator<` should have been overloaded for the type in question (in order
    for the method to compile successfully). The uncalled method has simply not been
    expanded for the compiler to verify.

    we can make template code even further extensible by ensuring that typical operators
    used within method bodies can be applied to any type we would want to utilize
    in the template expansion. Our code becomes more widely applicable.

- en: In this chapter, we have furthered our C++ programming knowledge beyond OOP
    language features to include additional language features that will enable us
    to write more extensible code. We have learned how to utilize template functions
    and template classes and how operator overloading nicely supports these endeavors.

- en: We have seen that templates can allow us to generically specify a class or function
    with respect to the data type primarily used within that class or function. We
    have seen that template classes inevitably utilize template functions because
    those methods generally need to generically use the data upon which the class
    is built. We have seen that by taking advantage of operator overloading for user
    defined types, we can take advantage of method bodies written using simple operators
    to accommodate usage by more complex data types, making the template code much
    more useful and extensible.

- en: We now understand that using templates can allow us to specify a class or function
    just one time more abstractly and allow the preprocessor to generate many versions
    of that class or function for us, based upon specific data types that may be needed
    within the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By allowing the preprocessor to expand many versions of a template class or
    set of template functions for us based on types needed in an application, the
    work of creating many similar classes or functions (and maintaining those versions)
    is passed to C++, rather than the programmer. In addition to having less code
    for the user to maintain, changes made in the template classes or functions need
    only be made in one place – the preprocessor will re-expand the code without errors
    when needed.

- en: We have added additional, useful features to our C++ repertoire through examining
    templates, which, combined with operator overloading, will ensure we can write
    highly extensible and reusable code for nearly any data type. We are now ready
    to continue forward with [*Chapter 14*](B15702_14_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor518),
    *Understanding STL Basics*, so that we can continue extending our C++ programming
    skills with useful C++ library features that will make us better programmers.
    Let's move forward!

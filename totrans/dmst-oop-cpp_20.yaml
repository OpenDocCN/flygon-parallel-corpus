    beyond OOP concepts, with the goal of enabling you to solve recurring types of
    coding problems by utilizing common design patterns. Design patterns will also
    enhance code maintenance and provide avenues for potential code reuse. The goal
    of the fourth section of the book, beginning with this chapter, is to demonstrate
    and explain popular design patterns and idioms and learn how to implement them
    effectively in C++.

    a type of programming problem, we can make use of a *tried and true* solution
    that other programmers have tested comprehensively. Additionally, once we employ
    a design pattern, other programmers immersing themselves in our code (for maintenance
    or future enhancements) will have a basic understanding of the techniques we have
    chosen, as core design patterns have become an industry standard.

- en: Some of the earliest design patterns came about nearly 50 years ago, with the
    advent of the **Model-View-Controller** paradigm, later simplified at times as
    **Subject-View**. For example, Subject-View is a rudimentary pattern in which
    an object of interest (the **Subject**) will be loosely coupled from its method
    of display (its **View**). The Subject and its View communicate with a one-to-one
    association. Sometimes Subjects can have multiple Views, in which case the Subject
    is associated with many View objects. If one View changes, a state update can
    be sent to the Subject, who can then send necessary messages to the other Views
    so that they, too, can be updated to reflect how the new state may have modified
    their particular View.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The original **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**) pattern, emanating from early
    OOP languages such as Smalltalk, has a similar premise, except that a Controller
    object delegates events between the Model (that is, the Subject) and its View
    (or Views). These preliminary paradigms influenced early design patterns; the
    elements of Subject-View or MVC can be seen conceptually as a rudimentary basis
    for core design patterns today.

    to solve problems stemming from applications we have introduced in earlier chapters

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the **Observer pattern**, an object of interest will maintain a list of observers
    who are interested in state updates of the main object. The observers will maintain
    a link to their object of interest. We will refer to the main object of interest
    as the **Subject**. The list of interested objects are known collectively as the
    **Observers**. The Subject will inform any Observer of relevant state changes.
    The Observers, once notified of any state changes of the Subject, will take any
    appropriate next action themselves (usually through a virtual function invoked
    on each Observer by the Subject).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Already, we can imagine how an Observer pattern may be implemented using associations.
    In fact, the Observer represents a one-to-many association. The Subject, for example,
    may use an STL `list` (or `vector`) to collect a set of Observers. Each Observer
    will contain an association to the Subject. We can imagine an important operation
    on the Subject, corresponding to a state change in the Subject, issuing an update
    to its list of Observers to *notify* them of the state change. The `Notify()`
    method is, in fact, invoked when a Subject's state changes and uniformly applies
    polymorphic Observer `Update()` methods on each of the Subject's list of Observers.
    Before we get swept up in implementation, let's consider the key components comprising
    the Observer pattern.

    that they may be combined with a variety of concrete classes (mostly through inheritance)
    that desire to use the Observer pattern. A generic Subject and Observer provides
    a great opportunity for reuse. With a design pattern, many core elements of a
    pattern can often be set up more generically to allow for greater reuse of the
    code itself, not only the reuse in the concept of the solution (pattern).

    the framework for *registering* an `Observer` with a `Subject` and for the `Subject`
    to `Notify()` its set of observers of a state change it may have. We will then
    derive from these base classes descendent classes we are accustomed to seeing
    – `Course` and `Student`, where `Course` will be our concrete `Subject` and `Student`
    will become our concrete `Observer`.

    the concept of a wait-list. As we have seen before in *Question 2* of [*Chapter
    10*](B15702_10_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor386), *Implementing Association,
    Aggregation, and Composition*, we will model a `Student` having an association
    to many `Course` instances, and a `Course` having an association to many `Student`
    instances. The Observer pattern will come into play when we model our wait-list.

    students who have been successfully enrolled in the course at hand.

    will include a list of `Course` instances in which that `Student` is currently

    to an association to a `Course` that `Student` is waiting for. This *wait-list*
    `Course` represents the `Subject` from which we will receive notifications. A
    notification will correspond to a state change indicating that the `Course` now
    has room for a `Student` to add the `Course`.

    `Update()`, which will correspond to the `Student` being notified that a spot

    to move a `Student` from the wait-list (there's a `waitList` data member) to the

    Here, we include an `observerState` and protected constructors to initialize this
    state. We include a protected `SetState()` method to update this state from the
    scope of a derived class. We also include a public `GetState()` method. The addition
    of `GetState()` will facilitate implementation within our Subject's `Notify()`
    method by allowing us to easily check if the state of our `Observer` has changed.
    Though state information has historically been added to derived classes of both
    `Observer` and `Subject`, we will instead generalize state information in these
    base classes. This will allow our derived classes to remain more pattern-independent
    and instead focused on the essence of the application.

    includes an STL `list` to collect its `Observer` instances. It also includes the
    `subjectState` and a counter to reflect the number of observers. Also, we include
    a data member to keep track of an uncorrupted iterator. We'll see this will be
    handy once we erase an element (`list::erase()` is an operation that will invalidate
    a current iterator).

    method, which initializes or sets the `Subject`'s state. Though this class is
    not technically abstract (it does not contain a pure virtual function), its constructors
    are protected to simulate an abstract class; this class is only intended to be
    constructed as a sub-object within a derived class instance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the public interface, we have some access functions to get the current state
    or number of observers. We also have a virtual destructor, and virtual functions
    for `Register()`, `Release()`, and `Notify()`. We will provide implementations
    for the latter three methods at this base class level.
  prefs: []

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the aforementioned `Subject` member functions, let's begin by examining the
    `void Subject::Register(Observer *)` method. Here, we simply add the `Observer
    *` specified as a parameter to our STL `list` of observers (and increase the counter
    for the number of observers).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, let's consider the inverse of `Register()` by reviewing `void Subject::Release(Observer
    *)`. Here, we iterate through our list of observers until we find the one we are
    seeking. We then call `list::erase()` on that current item, set our `found` flag
    to `true` (to leave the loop), and decrement the number of observers. Also notice
    that we save the return value of `list::erase()`, which is an updated (and valid)
    iterator to the list of observers. The iterator `iter` in the loop has been invalidated
    with our call to `list::erase()`. We save this revised iterator in a data member
    `newIter` so that we can access it shortly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, let's take a look at the `Notify()` method in `Subject`. This method
    will be called once there is a state change in the `Subject`. The goal will be
    to `Update()` all observers on the `Subject`'s observer list. To do just that,
    we look through our list. One by one, we grab an `Observer` with the list iterator
    using `Observer *temp = *iter;`. We call `Update()` on the current `Observer`
    with `temp->Update();`. We can tell if the update has been a success for a given
    `Observer` by checking the observer's state using `if (temp->GetState() == 1)`.
    With a state of `1`, we know the observer's actions will have caused the `Release()`
    function we just reviewed to be called on itself. Because the `list::erase()`
    used in `Release()` has invalidated the iterator, we now get the correct and revised
    iterator using `iter = newIter;`. Finally, outside of the loop, we call `Update()`
    on the last item in the list of observers.

    Additionally, keep in mind that we inherit the STL `list` of observers from our
    `Subject` base class. This list of `Observer` instances will represent the `Student`
    instances comprising our wait-list for the `Course`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Course` class additionally includes a constructor, a virtual destructor,
    and simple access functions. Note that the virtual destructor has more work to
    do than shown – if a `Course` destructs, we must remember to first remove (but
    not delete) `Student` instances from the `Course`. Our `bool Course::AddStudent(Student
    *)` interface will allow us to add a `Student` to a `Course`. Of course, we should
    ensure that the `Student` has not already added to the `Course` in the body of
    this method.

- en: Our `void Course::Open();` method will be invoked on a `Course` to indicate
    that the course is now available to add students. Here, we will first set the
    state to `1` (indicating *Open for Enrollment*) and then call `Notify()`. Our
    `Notify()` method in the base class `Subject` loops through each `Observer`, calling
    polymorphic `Update()` on each observer. Each `Observer` is a `Student`; `Student::Update()`
    will allow each `Student` on the wait-list to try to add the `Course`, which now
    is open to receive students. With a successful addition to the course's current
    student list, a `Student` will then request `Release()` of its position on the
    wait-list (as an `Observer`).

    to add, yet currently cannot, that is, a *wait-listed* course. Notice that this
    link is declared in the form of the derived type, `Course`, not the base type,
    `Subject`. This is typical in the Observer pattern and will help us avoid dreaded
    down-casting as we override our `Update()` method in `Student`. It is through
    this link that we will conduct our interaction with our `Subject` and the means
    by which we will receive updates from our `Subject` as it changes states.

    to most of the necessary components and mechanics in the `Student` class, we will
    focus on the newly added `Student` methods, starting with an alternate constructor.
    Here, let us assume that we set most of the data members as usual. The key additional
    lines of code here are `waitList = c;` to set our wait-list entry to the desired
    `Course` (`Subject`) as well as `c->Register(this);`, where we add the `Student`

    is, `courses[currentNumCourses++] = c;` to have the student's current course list
    to contain an association to the new `Course` as well as `c->AddStudent(this);`
    to ask the current `Course` to add the `Student` (`this`) to its enrolled student

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Continuing with the remainder of our previously mentioned Student member functions,
    next, in our polymorphic `void Student::Update()` method, we conduct the desired
    adding of a wait-list course. Recall, `Notify()` will be called when there is
    a state change on our `Subject` (`Course`). One such state change may be when
    a `Course` is *Open for Enrollment*, or perhaps a state of *New Space Available*
    now exists following a `Student` dropping the `Course`. `Notify()` then calls
    `Update()` on each `Observer`. Our `Update()` has been overridden in `Student`
    to get the state of the `Course` (`Subject`). If the state indicates the `Course`
    is now *Open for Enrollment*, we try `AddCourse(waitList);`. If this is a success,
    we set the state of the `Student` (`Observer`) to `1` (*Add Success*) to indicate
    that we have been successful in our `Update()`, which means we've added the `Course`.
    Next, since we have added the desired course to our current course list, we can
    now remove ourselves from the `Course`'s wait-list. That is, we will want to remove
    ourselves (`Student`) as an `Observer` from the `Subject` (the `Course`'s wait-list)
    using `waitList->Release(this);`. Now that we have added our desired wait-list
    course, we can also remove our link to the `Subject` using `waitList = 0;`.

    that allows us to provide an initial `Course` that each `Student` would like to
    add when course registration commences. Note that these `Students` (`Observers`)
    will be added to the wait-list for their desired courses (`Subject`). Here, a
    `Subject` (`Course`) will have a list of `Observers` (`Students`) who wish to
    add the course when registration opens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for Enrollment* for registration with `c1->Open();`. `Course::Open()` sets the
    state of the `Subject` to `1`, meaning the course is *Open for Enrollment* and
    then calls `Notify()`. As we know, `Subject::Notify()` will call `Update()` on
    the `Subject`'s list of observers. It is here that an initial wait-list `Course`
    instance will be added to a student's schedule and be subsequently removed as
    an `Observer` from the `Subject`'s wait-list.

    Should a `Course` be full, the `Student` will be added to the `Course`'s wait-list
    (modeled as the inherited `Subject`'s list of observers). Recall, `Course` inherits
    from `Subject`, which keeps a list of students interested in adding a particular
    course (the wait-list of observers). When the `Course` state changes to *New Space
    Available*, students on the waitlist (observers) will be notified, and the `Update()`
    method on each `Student` will subsequently call `AddCourse()` for that `Student`.

    design patterns. Our primary goal is to enable you to solve recurring types of
    coding problems using *tried and true* solutions by applying common design patterns.

    employing them in our code. We have then specifically understood the premise behind
    the Observer pattern and how it contributes to OOP. Finally, we have taken a look
    at how we may implement the Observer pattern in C++.

- en: Utilizing common design patterns, such as the Observer pattern, will help you
    more easily solve recurring types of programming problems in a manner understood
    by other programmers. A key tenant in OOP is to strive for the reuse of components
    whenever possible. By utilizing design patterns, you will be contributing to reusable
    solutions with more sophisticated programming techniques.

    17*](B15702_17_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor649), *Implementing the Factory
    Pattern*. Adding more patterns to our collection of skills makes us more versatile
    and valued programmers. Let's continue forward!

- en: a. Implement (or modify your previous) `Student::DropCourse()`. When a `Student`
    drops a `Course`, this event will cause the `Course` state to become state `2`,
    *New Space Available*. With the state change, `Notify()` will then be called on
    the `Course` (`Subject`), which will then `Update()` the list of observers (students
    on the wait-list). `Update()` will indirectly allow wait-listed `Student` instances,
    if any, to now add the `Course`.

    student's current course list.

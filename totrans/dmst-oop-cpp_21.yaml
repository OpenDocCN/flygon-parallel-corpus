- en: The **Factory pattern**, or **Factory Method pattern**, is a creational design
    pattern that allows the creation of objects without needing to specify the exact
    (derived) class that will be instantiated. A Factory Method pattern provides an
    interface for creating an object, yet allows details within the creation method
    to decide which (derived) class to instantiate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Factory Method pattern is also known as a **virtual constructor**. Much as
    a virtual destructor has a specific destructor (which is the entry point of the
    destruction sequence) determined at runtime through dynamic binding, the concept
    of a virtual constructor is such that the desired object to instantiate is uniformly
    determined at runtime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a Factory Method pattern, we will specify an abstract class (or interface)
    for collecting and specifying the general behaviors of derived classes we wish
    to create. The abstract class or interface in this pattern is known as a **Product**.
    We then create the derived classes that we may want to instantiate, overriding
    any necessary abstract methods. The various concrete derived classes are known
    as **Concrete Products**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then specify a Factory Method whose purpose is to host an interface for uniformly
    creating instances of Concrete Products. The Factory Method can either be placed
    in the abstract Product class or in a separate Object Factory class; an **Object
    Factory** represents a class with the task of creating concrete Products. This
    Factory (creation) Method will be static if placed within the abstract Product
    class and optionally static if instead placed within an Object Factory class.
    The Factory Method will decide which specific Concrete Product to manufacture,
    based on a consistent list of input parameters. The Factory Method will return
    a generalized Product pointer to the Concrete Product. Polymorphic methods can
    be applied to the newly created object to elicit its specific behavior.

    instantiate various types of `Student` – `GradStudent`, `UnderGradStudent`, or
    `NonDegreeStudent` – based on their learning goals. The `Student` class will include
    an abstract polymorphic `Graduate()` operation; each derived class will override
    this method with varying implementations. For example, a `GradStudent` seeking
    a PhD may have more degree-related criteria to satisfy in the `GradStudent::Graduate()`
    method than other specializations of `Student`. They may require credit hours
    to be verified, a passing grade point average to be verified, and verification

    and destructor as necessary. We have moved `EarnPhD()` to `GradStudent`, as this
    method is not applicable to all `Student` instances. Instead, `EarnPhD()` is applicable
    to a subset of `GradStudent` instances; we will award the title of `"Dr."` only

    data member. Keep in mind that not all `Student` instances will receive degrees,
    so we don't want to generalize this attribute by defining it in `Student`. Though
    we could have introduced a shared base class of `DegreeSeekingStudent` for `UnderGradStudent`
    and `GradStudent` to collect this commonality, that fine level of granularization
    would add an additional layer almost unnecessarily. The duplication here is a
    design trade-off.

    method. We can imagine that the checklist for an undergraduate student for graduation
    may be quite different than that of a graduate student. For this reason, we can

    Here, based on the degree type that the `Student` seeks, one of `GradStudent`,
    `UnderGradStudent`, or `NonDegreeStudent` will be instantiated. Notice that the

    any of the derived class constructors. Also notice that any of these specialized

    type (`Student`).

    that this method is not obligated to instantiate a new derived class instance.
    Instead, it may recycle a previous instance that may still be available. For example,
    imagine a `Student` is temporarily unregistered in the university (due to late
    payment of fees), yet has been kept available on a list of *pending students*.
    The `MatriculateStudent()` method may instead choose to return a pointer to such
    an existing `Student`. *Recycling* is an alternative within a Factory Method!

    However, we can see a close coupling exists between the abstract Product containing

    concrete Products. Yet in OOP, a base class will typically have no knowledge of
    any descendent types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A disadvantage of this closely coupled implementation is that the abstract Product
    class must include a means for instantiation for each of its descendants in its
    static creation method, `MatriculateStudent()`. Adding new derived classes now
    affects the abstract base class definition – it needs to be recompiled. What if
    we don't have access to the source code for this base class? Is there a way to
    decouple the dependencies that exist between the Factory Method and the Products
    that the Factory Method will create? Yes, there is an alternative implementation.

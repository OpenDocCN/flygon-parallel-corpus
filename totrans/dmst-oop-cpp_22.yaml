- en: The **Adapter pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a means
    for converting an existing, undesirable interface of a class to an interface which
    another class expects. An **Adapter class** will be the link for communication
    between two existing components, adapting the interfaces so that the two may share
    and exchange information. An Adapter allows two or more classes to work together,
    which otherwise could not do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ideally, an Adapter will not add functionality, but will add the preferred interface
    for usage (or conversion) to either allow one class to be used in an expected
    manner or for two otherwise incompatible classes to communicate with one another.
    In its most simple form, an Adapter simply converts an existing class to support
    an expected interface as may be specified in an OO design.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Adapter can be either associated to, or derived from, the class for which
    it is providing an adaptive interface. If inheritance is used, a private or protected
    base class is appropriate to hide the underlying implementation. If, instead,
    the Adapter class is associated to the class with the undesirable interface, the
    methods in the Adapter class (with the new interfaces) will merely delegate the
    work to its associated class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Adapter pattern can also be used to add an OO interface to (that is, to
    *wrap an OO interface around*) a series of functions or other classes, allowing
    assorted existing components to be utilized more naturally in an OO system. This
    specific type of Adapter is known as a `extern C`, to allow the linker to resolve
    linkage conventions between the two languages).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Utilizing the Adapter pattern has benefits. The Adapter allows the reuse of
    existing code by providing a shared interface to allow otherwise unrelated classes
    to communicate. The OO programmer will now use the Adapter class directly, allowing
    for easier maintenance of the application. That is, most programmer interaction
    will be with a well-designed Adapter class, rather than with two or more odd components.
    A small drawback of using an Adapter is slightly decreased performance from the
    added layer of code. However, most often, reusing existing components through
    providing a clean interface to support their interaction is a winning proposition,
    despite a (hopefully small) performance trade-off.

    (or more) incompatible classes. The *Adaptee* will be a well-tested class which
    we would like to reuse (but which has an undesirable interface), and the *Target*
    classes will be those specified in our OO design for an application in the making.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    class. We will then create an Adapter class to modify the interface of the Adaptee.
    We will also identify our Target class, representing the class we need to model
    per our OO design. At times, our Adapter and Target may be rolled into a single
    class. In an actual application, we will additionally have Client classes, representing
    the full complement of classes found in the final application at hand. Let's start
    with the Adaptee and Adapter classes, as these class definitions will begin the
    foundation on which to build our pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our example, we will specify our Adaptee class as one we are accustomed to
    seeing – `Person`. We will imagine that our planet has recently become aware of
    many other exoplanets capable of supporting life and that we have benevolently
    made allies with each such civilization. Further imagining that the various software
    systems on Earth would like to welcome and include our new friends, including
    `Romulans` and `Orkans`, we would like to adapt some of our existing software
    to easily accommodate the new demographics of our exoplanet neighbors. With that
    in mind, we will transform our `Person` class to include more interplanetary terminology
    by creating an Adapter class, `Humanoid`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our forthcoming implementation, we will use private inheritance to inherit
    `Humanoid` (Adapter) from `Person` (Adaptee), therefore hiding the underlying
    implementation of the Adaptee. We could have alternatively associated a `Humanoid`
    to a `Person` (an implementation we will also review in this section). We can
    then flesh out some derived classes of `Humanoid` within our hierarchy, such as
    `Orkan`, `Romulan` and `Earthling`, to accommodate the intergalactic application
    at hand. The `Orkan`, `Romulan` and `Earthling` classes can be considered our
    Target classes, or those which our application will instantiate. We will choose
    to make our Adapter class, `Humanoid`, abstract so that it is not directly instantiable.
    Because our specific derived classes (Target classes) can be generalized by their
    abstract base class type (`Humanoid`) in our application (Client), we can also
    consider `Humanoid` a Target class. That is, `Humanoid` can be viewed primarily
    as an Adapter, but secondarily as a generalized Target class.

    as we have been accustomed to seeing it in many other examples throughout this
    book. This class is instantiable; however, `Person` is not an appropriate class
    to instantiate in our intergalactic application. Instead, the expected interface
    would be to utilize that found in `Humanoid`.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the aforementioned `Humanoid` class, our goal is to provide an Adapter to
    contribute the expected interface that our intergalactic application requires.
    We simply derive `Humanoid` from `Person` using private inheritance, hiding the
    public interfaces found in `Person` from use outside the scope of `Humanoid`.
    We understand that the target application (Client) would not wish for the public
    interfaces found in `Person` to be utilized by various subtypes of `Humanoid`
    instances. Notice that we are not adding functionality, only adapting the interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then notice the public methods introduced in `Humanoid` that provide the
    desired interfaces for the Target class(es). The implementation of these interfaces
    is often straightforward. We simply call the inherited method defined in `Person`
    which will easily complete the task at hand (but which uses an unacceptable interface
    to do so). For example, our `Humanoid::GetPrimaryName()` method simply calls `Person::GetLastName();`
    to complete the task. However, `GetPrimaryName()` may more so represent appropriate
    intergalactic lingo than `Person::GetLastName()`. We can see how `Humanoid` is
    serving as an Adapter for `Person`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that it is not necessary to precede the calls to `Person` base class methods
    within Humanoid methods with `Person::` (except when a `Humanoid` method calls
    the same named method in `Person`, such as with `GetTitle()`). The scope resolution
    usage of `Person::` avoids potential recursion in these situations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also notice that `Humanoid` introduces an abstract polymorphic method (that
    is, a pure virtual function) with the specification of `virtual const char *Converse()
    = 0;`. We have made the design decision that only derived classes of `Humanoid`
    will be instantiable. Nonetheless, we understand that public descendant classes
    may still be collected by their base class type of `Humanoid`. Here, `Humanoid`
    serves primarily as the Adapter class and secondarily as a Target class offering
    the suite of acceptable interfaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice that our pure virtual function `virtual const char *Converse() = 0;`
    includes a default implementation. This is rare, but allowed so long as the implementation
    is not written inline. Here, we utilize the opportunity to specify a default behavior
    for `Humanoid::Converse()` by simply calling `Person::Speak()`.

  type: TYPE_PRE

    from `Humanoid`. An `Orkan` *Is-A* `Humanoid`. As such, all of the public interfaces
    in `Humanoid` are available to `Orkan` instances. Notice that our alternate constructor
    sets the default greeting message to `"Nanu nanu"`, per the `Orkan` dialect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because we wish `Orkan` to be a concrete, instantiable class, we must override
    `Humanoid::Converse()` and provide an implementation in the `Orkan` class. Notice,
    however, that `Orkan::Converse()` simply calls `Humanoid::Converse();`. Perhaps
    `Orkan` finds the default implementation in its base class acceptable. Notice
    that we use the `Humanoid::` scope resolution to qualify `Converse()` within the
    `Orkan::Converse()` method to avoid recursion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interestingly, had `Humanoid` not been an abstract class, `Orkan` would not
    have had to override `Converse()` – the default behavior would have automatically
    been inherited. Yet, with `Humanoid` defined as abstract, the override of `Converse()`
    is necessary in `Orkan`, otherwise `Orkan` will also be viewed as an abstract
    class. No worries! We can utilize the benefit of the default behavior of `Humanoid::Converse()`
    merely by calling it within `Orkan::Converse()`. This will satisfy the requirements
    for making `Orkan` concrete, while allowing `Humanoid` to remain abstract, while
    still providing the rare default behavior for `Converse()`!

    `Orkan`, `Romulan` and an `Earthling` and add each to the list using `allies.push_back()`.
    Again, using the `STL`, we next create a list iterator to walk through the list
    of pointers to `Humanoid` instances. As we iterate through our generalized list
    of allies, we call the approved interfaces of `GetInfo()` and `Converse()` on
    each item in our list (that is, for each specific type of `Humanoid`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we specify one specific `Humanoid`, an `Earthling`, and change this instance's
    default greeting by invoking `e1->SetSalutation("Bonjour");`. By calling `Converse()`
    again on this instance (we first did so on this object generically in the aforementioned
    loop), we can request that the `Earthling` uses `"Bonjour"` to greet allies instead
    of `"Hello"` (the default greeting for `Earthling`).

    derive Adapter from Adaptee) is that the coding is very straightforward. With
    this approach, any protected methods in the Adaptee class can easily be carried

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An interesting point to consider when choosing between private inheritance or
    association as the relationship between Adapter and Adaptee is whether or not
    the Adaptee contains any protected members. Recall, the original code for `Person`
    included a protected `ModifyTitle()` method. Should protected members exist in
    the Adaptee class, the private base class implementation allows those inherited,
    protected members to continue to be accessed within the scope of the Adapter class
    (that is, by methods of the Adapter). However, using the association-based implementation,
    the protected methods in the Adaptee (`Person`) are unusable in the scope of the
    Adapter. To make this example work, we were required to move `Person::ModifyTitle()`
    to the public access region. However, modifying the Adaptee class is not always
    possible, nor is it necessarily recommended. Considering the protected member
    issue, our initial implementation using a private base class is the stronger implementation,
    as it does not depend on us modifying the class definition of the Adaptee (`Person`).

    the concepts of Adapter, Adaptee, Target and Client into the framework of classes
    we are accustomed to seeing, namely `Person`, as well as into descendants of our
    Adapter (`Orkan`, `Romulan`, `Earthling`, as in our first two examples). Let us
    now briefly recap what we have learned relating to patterns before moving forward
    to our next chapter.

- en: In this chapter, we have advanced our pursuit to become better C++ programmers
    through widening our knowledge of design patterns. We have explored the Adapter
    pattern in both concept and through multiple implementations. Our first implementation
    used private inheritance to derive the Adapter from the Adaptee class. We specified
    our Adapter as an abstract class and then used public inheritance to introduce
    several Target classes based on the interface provided by our Adapter class. Our
    second implementation instead modeled the relationship between the Adapter and
    Adaptee using association. We then looked at an example usage of an Adapter as
    a wrapper to simply add an OO interface to existing function-based application
    components.

    more easily reuse existing, well-tested portions of code in a manner understood
    by other programmers. By utilizing core design patterns, you will be contributing
    to well understood and reusable solutions with more sophisticated programming
    techniques.

    19*](B15702_19_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor718), *Using the Singleton Pattern*.
    Adding more patterns to our arsenal of programming skills makes us more versatile
    and valued programmers. Let's continue forward!

    (`Orkan`, `Romulan`, `Earthling`, and perhaps `Martian`). Decide whether you will
    use the private base class Adapter-Adaptee relationship or the association relationship
    between the Adapter and Adaptee (hint: the private inheritance version will be
    easier).'

- en: b. Noting that the `CitizenDataBase` handles `Person` instances, can this class
    be used *as-is* to store various types of `Humanoid` instances, or must it be
    adapted in some way? Recall, `Person` is a base class of `Humanoid` (if you chose
    this implementation), but also remember that we can never upcast past a non-public
    inheritance boundary.

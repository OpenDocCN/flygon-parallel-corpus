- en: The **pImpl pattern** (**p**ointer to **Impl**ementation idiom) is a structural
    design pattern that separates the implementation of a class from its public interface.
    This pattern was originally known as the **Bridge pattern** by the **Gang of Four**
    (**GofF**) and is also known as the **Cheshire Cat**, **compiler-firewall idiom**,
    **d-pointer**, **opaque pointer**, or **Handle pattern**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary purpose of this pattern is to minimize compile-time dependencies.
    The result of reducing compile-time dependencies is that changes in a class definition
    (most notably, the private access region) will not send a wave of timely recompilations
    throughout a developing or deployed application. Instead, the necessary recompiled
    code can be isolated to the *implementation* of the class itself. The other pieces
    of the application that depend on the class definition will no longer be affected
    by a recompile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Private members within a class definition can affect a class with respect to
    re-compilation. This is because changing the data members can alter the size of
    an instance of that type. Also, private member functions must be matched by signature
    to function calls for overloading resolution as well as potential type conversions.

    specify dependencies triggers re-compilation. By removing the class inner implementation
    details from a class header file (and placing these details in a source file),
    we can remove many dependencies. We can change which header files are included
    in other header and source code files, streamlining the dependencies and hence
    the re-compilation burden.

    responsible for managing the memory ourselves, including remembering to delete
    the allocated nested class type in our outer class destructor. Memory leaks, memory
    misuse, and memory errors are potential drawbacks of managing memory resources
    ourselves with raw pointers. For that reason, it is customary to implement the
    pImpl pattern using **smart pointers**.

    that the raw pointer is destructed when the wrapper object is popped off the stack
    (for local instances) or before the program terminates (for static and extern
    instances). Certainly, this class is basic, and we must determine the desired
    behaviors for the copy constructor and the assignment operator. That is, allow
    shallow copies/assignment, require deep copies/assignment, or disallow all copies/assignment.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is, nearly every request made of the target (interface) class will need to be
    delegated to its nested implementation class. The only requests that can be handled
    by the outer class will be those not involving any data members; those circumstances
    will be extraordinarily rare! Another disadvantage includes slightly higher memory
    requirements of instances to accommodate the added pointer as part of the pattern
    implementation. These issues will be paramount in embedded software systems and
    those requiring peak performance, but relatively minor otherwise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maintenance will be a little more difficult for classes employing the pImpl
    pattern, an unfortunate disadvantage. Each target class is now paired with an
    extra (implementation) class, including a set of forwarding methods to delegate
    requests to the implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A few implementation difficulties may also arise. For example, if any of the
    private members (now in the nested implementation class) need to access any of
    the protected or public methods of the outer interface class, we will need to
    include a backlink from the nested class to the outer class to access that member.
    Why? The `this` pointer in the inner class will be of the nested object type.
    Yet the protected and public methods in the outer object will expect a `this`
    pointer to the outer object – even if those public methods will then re-delegate
    the request to a call a private, nested class method for help. This backlink will
    also be required to call public virtual functions of the interface from the scope
    of the inner class (implementation). Keep in mind, however, that we impact performance
    with another added pointer per object and with delegation to call each method
    in the associated object.

    considerations. Of most importance, recompile time during development and maintenance

    the implementation of a class only requires the nested implementation class to
    be recompiled and linked in. Users of the outer class are unaffected. As a bonus,

    that we have guaranteed proper destruction of the associated implementation class.
    We also have the potential to save inadvertent programmer-introduced pointer and
    memory mishaps!

    and of the application at hand will help determine whether the pImpl pattern is
    appropriate in your design.

    pointer, and then applying a `unique_pointer`. Let us now briefly recap what we
    have learned relating to patterns before concluding our last chapter of this book.

- en: In this chapter, we have advanced our objective of becoming more indispensable
    C++ programmers by furthering our programming skills with another core design
    pattern. We have explored the pImpl pattern with an initial implementation using
    native C++ pointers and association and then improved our implementation by using
    a unique pointer. By examining the implementation, we easily understand how the
    pImpl pattern reduces compile-time dependencies and can make our code more implementation-dependent.

    more easily contribute to reusable, maintainable code that is understood by other
    programmers familiar with common design patterns. Your software solutions will
    be based on creative and well-tested design solutions.

    journey of understanding OOP in C++. You now have a multitude of skills, including
    a deep understanding of OOP, extended language features, and core design patterns,
    all of which make you a more valuable programmer.

    and additional design patterns to discover, you have more than a solid basis and
    level of expertise to easily navigate and acquire any additional language features,
    libraries, and patterns you may wish to embrace. You've come a long way; this
    has been an adventurous journey together! I have enjoyed every minute of our quest
    and I hope you have as well.

    necessary to serve as building blocks for our then-upcoming OOP journey. We then
    embraced C++ as an OOP language together, learning not only essential OO concepts
    but also how to implement them with either C++ language features, coding techniques,
    or both. We then extended your skills by adding knowledge of exception handling,
    friends, operator overloading, templates, STL basics, and testing OO classes and
    components. We then ventured into sophisticated programming techniques by embracing
    core design patterns, delving into code by applying each pattern of interest.

    and mastery. Each will help you to create more easily maintainable and robust
    code. Your future as a well-versed, skilled OO programmer in C++ awaits. Now,
    let's get programming!

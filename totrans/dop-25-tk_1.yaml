- en: By now, you probably understood that one of the critical aspects of a system
    based on Kubernetes is a high level of dynamism. Almost nothing is static. We
    define Deployments or StatefulSets, and Kubernetes distributes the Pods across
    the cluster. In most cases, those Pods are rarely sitting in one place for a long
    time. Rolling updates result in Pods being re-created and potentially moved to
    other nodes. Failure of any kind provokes rescheduling of the affected resources.
    Many other events cause the Pods to move around. A Kubernetes cluster is like
    a beehive. It's full of life, and it's always in motion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dynamic nature of a Kubernetes cluster is not only due to our (human) actions
    or rescheduling caused by failures. Autoscaling is to be blamed as well. We should
    fully embrace Kubernetes' dynamic nature and move towards autonomous and self-sufficient
    clusters capable of serving the needs of our applications without (much) human
    involvement. To accomplish that, we need to provide sufficient information that
    will allow Kubernetes' to scale the applications as well as the nodes that constitute
    the cluster. In this chapter, we'll focus on the former case. We'll explore commonly
    used and basic ways to auto-scale Pods based on memory and CPU consumption. We'll
    accomplish that using HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HorizontalPodAutoscaler's only function is to automatically scale the number
    of Pods in a Deployment, a StatefulSet, or a few other types of resources. It
    accomplishes that by observing CPU and memory consumption of the Pods and acting
    when they reach pre-defined thresholds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HorizontalPodAutoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller.
    The resource determines the behavior of the controller. The controller periodically
    adjusts the number of replicas in a StatefulSet or a Deployment to match the observed
    average CPU utilization to the target specified by a user.
  prefs: []

    features through practical examples. But, before we get there, we need a Kubernetes
    cluster as well as a source of metrics.

- en: The critical element in scaling Pods is the Kubernetes Metrics Server. You might
    consider yourself a Kubernetes ninja and yet never heard of the Metrics Server.
    Don't be ashamed if that's the case. You're not the only one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you started observing Kubernetes metrics, you might have used Heapster. It's
    been around for a long time, and you likely have it running in your cluster, even
    if you don't know what it is. Both serve the same purpose, with one being deprecated
    for a while, so let's clarify things a bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Early on, Kubernetes introduced Heapster as a tool that enables Container Cluster
    Monitoring and Performance Analysis for Kubernetes. It's been around since Kubernetes
    version 1.0.6\. You can say that Heapster has been part of Kubernetes' life since
    its toddler age. It collects and interprets various metrics like resource usage,
    events, and so on. Heapster has been an integral part of Kubernetes and enabled
    it to schedule Pods appropriately. Without it, Kubernetes would be blind. It would
    not know which node has available memory, which Pod is using too much CPU, and
    so on. But, just as with most other tools that become available early, its design
    was a "failed experiment".
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As Kubernetes continued growing, we (the community around Kubernetes) started
    realizing that a new, better, and, more importantly, a more extensible design
    is required. Hence, Metrics Server was born. Right now, even though Heapster is
    still in use, it is considered deprecated, even though today (September 2018)
    the Metrics Server is still in beta state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what is Metrics Server? A simple explanation is that it collects information
    about used resources (memory and CPU) of nodes and Pods. It does not store metrics,
    so do not think that you can use it to retrieve historical values and predict
    tendencies. There are other tools for that, and we'll explore them later. Instead,
    Metrics Server's goal is to provide an API that can be used to retrieve current
    resource usage. We can use that API through `kubectl` or by sending direct requests
    with, let's say, `curl`. In other words, Metrics Server collects cluster-wide
    metrics and allows us to retrieve them through its API. That, by itself, is very
    powerful, but it is only the part of the story.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I already mentioned extensibility. We can extend Metrics Server to collect metrics
    from other sources. We'll get there in due time. For now, we'll explore what it
    provides out of the box and how it interacts with some other Kubernetes resources
    that will help us make our Pods scalable and more resilient.
  prefs: []

    instead, prefer demonstrating features and principles through practical examples.
    This book is no exception, and we'll dive straight into Metrics Server hands-on
    exercises. The first step is to install it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Helm makes installation of almost any publicly available software very easy
    if there is a Chart available. If there isn't, you might want to consider an alternative
    since that is a clear indication that the vendor or the community behind it does
    not believe in Kubernetes. Or, maybe they do not have the skills necessary to
    develop a Chart. Either way, the best course of action is to run away from it
    and adopt an alternative. If that's not an option, develop a Helm Chart yourself.
    In our case, there won't be a need for such measures. Metrics Server does have
    a Helm Chart, and all we need to do is to install it.

    That would be a waste of our (human) talent. Instead, our goal should be to scrape
    those metrics from other tools and create alerts and (maybe) dashboards based
    on both real-time and historical data. For that, we need output in JSON or some

    reason is simple. HorizontalPodAutoscaler `v1` is too basic. It only allows scaling
    based on CPU. Even our simple example goes beyond that by adding memory to the
    mix. Later on, we'll extend it even more. So, while `v1` is considered stable,
    it does not provide much value, and we can either wait until `v2` is released
    or start experimenting with `v2beta` releases right away. We're opting for the
    latter option. By the time you read this, more stable releases are likely to exist

    of `80%`. Still, Kubernetes increased the number of replicas from one to two because
    that's the minimum we defined. We made the contract stating that the `api` Deployment
    should never have less than two replicas, and Kubernetes complied with that by
    scaling up even if the resource utilization is way below the expected average
    utilization. We can confirm that behavior through the events of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler.

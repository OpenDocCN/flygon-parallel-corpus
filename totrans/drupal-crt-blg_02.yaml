    widely accepted that during the process of building your website, you should not
    make it available for people to use over the Internet. Making your site *live*,
    while you are still making changes and breaking and fixing things, means that
    it is possible for people to find your site, attempt to use it, and form an exceedingly
    bad opinion of your web development skills. You might, in the worst case, find
    that you have even inadvertently allowed malicious users to gain access to sensitive
    information due to improperly implemented security settings, among other things.'

- en: Rather than allow the public access to your work in progress, it is far better
    to set up a PHP‑enabled web server on your home or office PC. This server, along
    with PHP and your database, can then be used to design and build everything just
    as you want it, before transferring the final product over to the live site. A
    development environment is precisely that machine, along with its attendant development
    tools and technologies, where you can build your site. This chapter therefore
    will ensure that you set yours up correctly and efficiently so that you can begin
    working on Drupal directly in the chapters that follow.

    this section to gain an appreciation of how everything is put together behind

    is written. Recently it has received a major upgrade and is now more or less a
    fully functional **Object Oriented Language**, with some very powerful features.
    PHP is widely used on the Internet for a multitude of different projects and is
    renowned for its ease of use. The current version of PHP is PHP 5, which is what
    we will use in this book for our demonstration since the latest version of Drupal
    is PHP 5 friendly. However, you are welcome to use version 4 because this is what
    most internet service providers use at present. The good news is that we will
    not have to delve deeply into programming code in order to build our site—Drupal
    handles most, if not all, of the complex programming issues.'

    *It is more widely used than all the other web servers combined*.'

    database. Keeping with the trend of popularity, MySQL is also the world''s most
    popular bit of database software with over six million active installations worldwide.'

    (HyperText Transfer Protocol) request. An HTTP request comes in two forms—either
    a `GET` or a `POST`. For our purposes, it is not important to understand how `GET`
    and `POST` work, as long as you understand that information can be captured from
    the user and sent to the server for processing using these requests.

    are required as a result of the user's request are performed.

    enhance your web pages with JavaScript much later on, in [Chapter 9](ch09.html

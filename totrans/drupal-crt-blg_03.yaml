    that the *basics* are easy to master, and therefore don't require too much thought.
    Things are not quite so clean cut in reality because while your site's basic setup
    is, more often than not, easy to implement, the more subtle problem is knowing
    *what* you want to implement, and *how* you want to implement it in the first
    place. Discovering what you need from your site is particularly important for
    precisely this reason, which is why we discussed it right at the start in [Chapter
    1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Introduction to Drupal").

    you know exactly what you want?* Not really; like most things, it''s a bit of
    a tradeoff when it comes to starting out with the development of your Drupal website.
    This is because it is almost impossible to determine exactly what your site will
    need, and how its functionality should be provided until you have been working
    with it for some time. Often, you will find yourself modifying the behavior of
    a site based on feedback from the users.'

    you should find that the number of changes you have to make down the line are
    kept to a minimum. Bear in mind though, that changes in Drupal are fairly easy

    hands dirty. For example, you should make it second nature to check how the changes
    made to the settings in Drupal affect the site. Learning which setting does what
    and how it alters the behavior of the site is really the goal of this chapter,
    and while we won't cover each and every little thing in excruciating detail, you
    will be shown enough to feel confident about your site's general configuration.

    broadest sense in that they modify its default behavior—things like what error
    pages are displayed, or what return email address your site will use. The trickier
    or more specific settings that apply to a focused area of concern, such as input
    formats, access rights, or module activation, will be discussed in more detail

    creating a flashy new theme would probably be more exciting, but taking the time
    to look through and play with all the available settings is an important step
    towards becoming a competent Drupal administrator. Not only will you learn how
    to get things done, but also what things can in fact be done. Believe me, with

    task instead of a specifically Drupal-oriented one. Because of this, everything

    are not always as straightforward as they seem. The reason the slogan is not displayed
    is because some themes don't display a slogan at all (or simply have the slogan

    anyone views any of the other content. For example, if you wanted to display some
    sort of promotional information or an introduction page, you could tell Drupal

    a few choices about how these will be presented on your website. The options presented
    in this section allow you to control how many feeds per page you wish to display,
    and whether you would like to show the title alone, the title plus a teaser, or
    the entire feed. These options are pretty straightforward and won't affect anything
    as it stands for the moment.

    time zones according to their location. By default, this is set to **Enabled**,
    which is fairly sensible unless you happen to know that the vast majority of your
    users will be from a fairly small geographic location. For example, if you are
    running a community site for your local SPCA in Wyoming, then it is unlikely that
    the site will have members in Kinshasa, and so the **Configurable time zones**
    option can be disabled.

    the date and time displayed on the site, and you should select the ones that agree
    with the majority of the site's intended users, or alternatively, the site's locality.
    Nothing too life threatening in there, and you can always make modifications at
    a later date if a change is necessary.

    to perform some sort of major work on the site. But be very careful when working
    on this, because if you log out, then you have just locked yourself out of the
    site. This is because only user 1 (that is the administrative user) can do anything
    on the site while it is offline. If you log off and try logging on again, you
    are no longer the administrative user; you are instead anonymous.

    of the **PHP mbstring extension**, which is not enabled by default. Provided you
    ensure that the live host has this extension enabled, Drupal will faithfully support
    multi-byte Unicode operations allowing your site to cater to some pretty far out
    characters in any language you like.

    site. We began by looking at some general configuration settings that are important
    in terms of getting the nuts and bolts in working order. Many of these settings
    will need to be revisited as the site develops, and as you become more adventurous.

    available when you need to deal with the site's overall well-being. From error
    handling to site maintenance, you should now be able to work with Drupal with
    some confidence.

    also related technologies that are useful to know. In this instance, taking time
    out to learn a bit of HTML will definitely help to get your content nicely organized,
    and displayed on the site. Not only will this be of benefit now (and most definitely
    later on in the development phase), but it is an important tool to have when working
    with the Web in general.

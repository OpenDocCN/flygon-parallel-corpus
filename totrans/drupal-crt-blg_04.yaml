    keen to begin working on the layout and functionality for the site. That's not
    to say we are going to discuss the type of layout that involves themes just yet,
    because there is plenty of work to be done deciding what goes where before we
    look at things like fonts, colors, and images. While we aren't working with anything
    as exciting as new images or flashy graphics, you will find that much of what
    we cover in this section is a matter of taste, and you can get fairly creative.

    to use chunks of free‑standing code called modules, which either come as part
    of the standard Drupal download, or are provided by the good people of the Drupal
    community. Modules simply sit around waiting till you need them, at which point,
    Drupal (knowing how to make use of them) calls on all the functionalities provided
    by the module file(s) in order to fulfill the tasks required of it.'

    from the point of view that modules provide functionality. It is possible to add
    your own functionality directly to your pages too, but that is a slightly different
    matter, which we will get into later. For now, the discussion of your site's functionality
    is really a discussion about modules.

    Unfortunately, things are not quite as easy as all that, and for at least a few
    of these modules, we will have to put in some serious thought before we actually
    implement them on the site. In particular, **forum** and **locale** need to be
    discussed in some depth. Before we do that, let's take a look at what else is
    available to us, courtesy of the Drupal community.

- en: One of the greatest things about Drupal is that it adheres to the open-source
    paradigm. This fosters community development, which in turn promotes and increases
    the diversity of any given project. One of the spin-offs from this is that community
    members who overcome certain obstacles or create something new and useful can,
    and often do, take the time to share it with everyone else. This is an exceptionally
    valuable property of most, if not all, open-source projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What this means for us is that we can take a leisurely scroll over a variety
    of modules that have been made by someone, improved on by someone else, or changed
    into something else, and pick and choose what we like the most. The converse of
    this is, of course, that you can make any of your own developments available for
    everyone else to use when the time comes.
  prefs: []

- en: For now, there are certain issues associated with using contributed modules
    such as the one we are going to incorporate into our site here. It is important
    to understand that people are providing useful software without enforcing payment.
    Hopefully, you will take it upon yourself to drop the developers a line every
    now and then to thank them for any functionality they have spent time and effort
    on that you may benefit from.
  prefs: []

- en: Secondly, because more often then not there is only one developer or a small
    group of developers, you need to understand that there is no huge budget, with
    lots of computer geeks tapping away day and night. This means that contributions,
    like any software, are subject to bugs or errors, and you should always make sure
    that your site, including the database, are protected by making backups before
    implementing any changes. (For more information on properly backing up your site,
    see [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your Website")) This is in line
    with best practices when it comes to dealing with software—if something breaks
    your code, then it is your responsibility, and not the contributor's.

    the correct version is very important because you cannot assume that a module
    developed for the **4.6.x** family will work with the latest **4.7.x** family.
    In fact, it is probably a bigger issue now than it will be in a year or so, since
    Drupal has only just reached the **4.7.x** family. Unfortunately, the upgrading
    of contributions is not necessarily done at the same time as the core development;
    so it may be that there are some modules you can only implement in older versions
    of Drupal—hopefully by the time you read this, most modules, if not all, will
    have been made compatible with **4.7.x**.
  prefs: []

    soon is **Taxonomy Access Control,** which can be found under the **Categories**
    section, assuming you are searching by category. Navigate there, click **Download**,
    and save the zipped file to your machine. You might find it more expedient to
    create a directory, say `drupal_downloads`, to save these files to. Of course,
    once the module is installed you no longer need the zip file. It may be useful
    to maintain a copy just in case, but if you are certain you won't need it again,
    remove it once everything is up and running.

    to take a look over the list of all modules available to see what you can actually
    achieve with Drupal. For example, *did you know that you can use Drupal as an
    e-commerce website, complete with products or services and a shopping cart?* You
    can implement all types of payment facilities such as PayPal, or credit cards
    and pretty much anything else that a fully-fledged online store would need—or
    will be able to once the **E-Commerce** module has been upgraded to work with
    4.7.

    system in order to function. The best way to learn about how to install modules
    is simply to go ahead and do it. Since we have already downloaded one, let's continue
    on and install it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open up the `.gz` file that you saved on your machine (refer to the previous
    section). Depending on the module in question you will have anywhere from one
    file to tens of files. As many will have license information in them, ensure that
    you take the time to read over these before you go ahead and use them. Apart from
    that, the first thing you need to do is open up the `readme` file as this will,
    more than likely, have some detailed information on what you can expect from the
    module, and how it functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming you are happy you have the right module for the job, the next file
    to open up is the install file, usually something like `INSTALL.txt`. This will
    give you a list of instructions to follow in order to set things up properly.
    More often than not, this involves making some sort of adjustment to your database
    as well as adding the relevant `.module` file to your `modules` folder under the
    Drupal home directory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes the developer of the module will add notes to guide your usage of
    the contribution. For example, in the case of the Taxonomy Access Control module,
    we are advised not to use it in conjunction with other access-related modules
    such as **OG** or **node_privacy_by_role**. That doesn't mean you can not—just
    that you should ensure you know exactly what you are doing before going against
    suggestions like the one provided with this module.

    the future is to make a backup of your database, or any important files, before
    making use of a module. The reason being is that Drupal is moving to a more user-friendly,
    plug-n-play type of setup where all that you need to do extract the module file
    to the `modules` folder and away you go. The module itself takes care of any changes
    required to be made to the database automatically. This makes it easier to install

    it is now easier to install a module, but it is also easier to *shoot yourself
    in the foot*. This is because the changes take place behind the scenes without
    you having direct control over them. Admittedly, these changes, more often than
    not, are fairly harmless, but you never know.

    of the topics up for discussion. What you are aiming for is an intuitive, logical,
    easy-to-use structure that will facilitate and encourage discussion by allowing
    users to easily find information—as opposed to frustrating them with a poor structure
    that effectively hides topics.'

    do we begin?* A good idea is to draw out your structure beforehand so that you
    can see how everything relates, and make changes before you begin creating or
    deleting forums. For example, it may seem logical to split up forums depending
    on location, so that people in the US go straight to the North American forums,
    and people in Africa go straight to the African forums.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of repeated topics for each continent (since wildlife issues are the same the
    world over). Even worse, if you were living in the States and were concerned about
    canned hunting in South Africa, where would you go to discuss this, Africa or
    North America? It seems that partitioning your forums based on location, in this
    instance, is probably not a good idea. *So what criteria do we use to categorize
    our forum content?*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best way to do it is by issue. People want to discuss issues or topics,
    and so they naturally look for content based on these criteria. When looked at
    in this light, the meaning of the **add containers** tab becomes clear, because
    now we can organize forum topics based on their common issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, one of the major areas of concern for wildlife today is the topic
    of conservation. This in turn has many facets, all of which would no doubt be
    of interest to the demo site's target audience. The environment is also an issue
    that should be discussed, and everyone is interested in research these days. These
    all seem like viable containers because they logically encapsulate the bulk of
    what people using this site will discuss.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moving ahead on this line of thought, each of the potential containers has distinct
    sub-categories that users would intuitively understand as topics for debate—we'll
    see the actual structure I came up with in a moment. Once you have a nice structure
    jotted down on paper, it is time to actually implement the forums on the site.
    Let's set about this by creating the containers first. Click **add container**
    to bring up a page that allows you to specify the name of the container, a brief
    description, the parent, and a weight.
  prefs: []

    container or forum has which parent. The top-level container or forum should obviously
    leave the parent as**<root>**. You can set the weight of the container or forum
    if you would like them to be presented in an order other than alphabetical—the
    smaller the weight; the closer to the top of the pile it will appear.

    to be most important. As global warming is a huge issue, it warrants a promotion
    to its own forum.

    appearing under this. It is possible to add containers within containers and so
    on, but in the interests of making it easy to find topics, you should try keeping
    a flat structure instead of creating a deep navigation structure wherever possible.
    This is because it is easier for people to search a list than to navigate a deep
    hierarchy.

    issues, which you should take into consideration when adjusting the settings.
    For a start, the indexing process that is used to build the search in the database
    relies on cron (discussed in [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your
    Website")). You will need to ensure that you have this operating correctly on
    your live site if you are going to implement a search feature. For more information
    on cron jobs and the `cron.php` script provided with Drupal, you can also visit
    **system** in the **help** section under the **administer** menu item.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is possible to re-index your site manually by clicking on the **Re-index
    site** button at the top of the search page, under the **settings** menu item.
    This will cause Drupal to go over the site's content and update its index so that
    any new content that you specifically wish to be included in any searches will
    be.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the other settings in this section relate to the performance of the
    system. For example, as the number of items you choose to index per cron run will
    also affect the speed of the cron job, you might have to make this setting a little
    lower if you are running into time-out problems. As well as this, indexing shorter
    words adds load to your system, because it has to index that many more words in
    the content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, it is possible to decide on how to weigh the site search based on
    three criteria, namely **Keyword relevance, Recently posted**, and **Number of
    comments**. You need to work out which criterion is more important, and which
    one can be safely downgraded in importance. In the case of the demo site, the
    following settings were used:'

    to hinge on whether there is a strong correlation between the search terms and
    the content. Effectively, we are saying that just because a posting is new, doesn't
    make it more worthwhile, and just because a piece of content has been commented
    on extensively, doesn't make it more relevant. Depending on your criteria, you
    may choose something completely different—the bottom line is to ensure that the
    search results are as relevant as possible to the site's users.

- en: Depending on which version of Drupal you have, it may also be possible to decide
    what types of files are to be allowed onto the site. Remember that some files
    can contain harmful or malicious code like spyware, viruses, or Trojans. You probably
    don't want to run the risk of spreading them around by allowing `.exe` or other
    executable files to be made available. Further, you need to think about how much
    disk space there is available. The last thing you want to do is allow people to
    upload entire movie files that can take up gigabytes of space at a time; so ensure
    that the **Maximum file size** and **Total file size per user** are kept down
    to a reasonable limit.

    to access a block or not, or whether the block should be displayed on all pages
    or only on selected pages. In order to find out how to deal with these issues,
    we must look at block configuration in some detail.

    when a block is shown, and to whom. Of course, some modules don't require any
    specific settings of their own; so you might find that you are only required to
    make specific decisions about users and pages more often than not.

    page. This page allows us to decide how long users can be inactive, before we
    no longer consider them online, as well as, the maximum number of people to show
    at any one time. That''s easy enough to deal with, and really depends on the needs
    of the site. The next two options give us something to think about though:'

    for whether they can see the **Who's online** block—although, it is visible by
    default. While you might find that most of your casual users don't really mind,
    regular users often appreciate being given some control over how they set up their
    pages.

    want to display a certain block on a certain page ever?* Well, the next section
    allows us to do exactly this, and if you look at the screenshot before last, you
    will see that the **Show on every page except the listed pages** option has been
    selected and the text**<front>** has been entered in the **Pages** text area.
    This means that whenever someone visits the site, they aren''t shown who is online.
    This information only becomes available once they have logged in or begun using
    the site by looking over content or adding material.'

    on, when there are specific reasons to show or not show information. As always,
    it is recommended that you play around and attempt to show a module on a certain
    page but not others. *For example, can you show a block only when someone is using
    the forums?* The answer is of course to select **Show on only the listed pages**
    option, and then enter **forum** or **forum/*** into the text area. Make sure
    this is correct by trying it out on your own machine.

    each one you have enabled, and making the appropriate decisions about when, where,

    all important topic of adding functionality and organizing it on the site. This
    is one of the most important tasks you will undertake during the development phase.
    Selecting and implementing the right functionality is a subtle task, but hopefully
    you found that Drupal makes it quite easy to implement once you have made up your
    mind about what goes where.

    community to draw from, when we downloaded and installed a contribution module.
    Contribution modules are an invaluable resource for extending the functionality
    of a site. This valuable facility comes with the express warning that you need
    to safeguard the security of your site by making backups before implementing any
    changes.

    easy it is to customize the site's menu and navigation. Having a powerful tool,
    combined with the flexibility of the menu system, is an extraordinary help when
    it comes to creating a well designed and easy‑to‑use site. Hopefully, the relationship
    between how menus are created and how they relate to the functionality provided
    by the modules became clear to you over the course of the latter stages of the
    chapter.

    that, because Drupal is so flexible and customizable, there are a large number
    of settings that are held at different places. Keeping track of all of these might
    seem quite daunting at first, but you will become more familiar with them as you
    work with Drupal. Eventually, you will be able to find your way around with ease.

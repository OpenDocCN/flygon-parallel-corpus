    Up until now we have focused on adding and organizing the site's basic functionality.
    We have not yet given any thought to how this functionality is to be accessed,
    or by whom. As the site grows, you will most likely feel the need to delegate
    certain responsibilities to various people. Alternatively, you might organize
    a team of people to work on specific aspects of the site. Whatever your needs,
    at some stage you will have to make decisions about who can do what, and the good
    people at Drupal have made sure that it is possible to do precisely this.

    of your access control policies does not mean that the task is a trivial one.
    There is still much thought that needs to go on behind the scenes in order to
    create a sophisticated, and above all, effective policy for controlling access
    to the site. Because of this, we will spend a bit of time exploring the ramifications
    of the various choices available, instead of simply listing them. Taking a holistic
    approach to your access control policy will ensure you don't end up with any nasty
    surprises down the line.

    than likely using the administrative user (user number 1) for all the site's development
    needs. That is absolutely fine, but once you have finished making any major changes
    to the site, you should begin using a normal administrative user that has only
    the permissions required to complete your day-to-day tasks. The next section will
    highlight the general philosophy behind user access, which should make the reason
    for this clear.

    will be required of yourself, other community members, or even anonymous users.
    In other words, *will there be a team of moderators working to ensure that the
    content of the site conforms to the dictates of good taste and avoids material
    that is tantamount to hate speech and so on? Will there be subject experts who
    are allowed to create and maintain their own content? How much will anonymous
    visitors be allowed to become involved, or will they be forced to merely window
    shop without being able to contribute?*

    with the community, and so you want to be extremely flexible in your approach.
    However, you can take it as given that your site and access policies are already
    flexible, given how easy it is to make changes in Drupal. This means that no one
    is exempt from building a proper access control plan to begin with. If you need
    to change it as time goes by, so be it, but at least there will be a coherent
    set of roles from the start.

    you should be able to see why this is so important. Obviously, the last thing
    anyone wants is for an anonymous user to be able to modify the personal blog of
    a respected industry expert. This means that each type of user should have carefully
    controlled permissions that effectively block their ability to act outside the
    scope of their role.
  prefs: []

    of specific roles rather than create a generic role or two, and allow everyone
    to use those catch-all permissions. Drupal gives us fine-grained control over
    what users can accomplish, and you should make good use of this facility. It may
    help to think of your access control using the following figure (this does not

    site. Contained within this set are the various roles that exist either by default,
    like the **Anonymous users** role, or those you create in order to cater for the
    different types of users the site will require—in this case, the **Blog Writer
    users** and **Forum Moderator users** roles. Each role can then contain any number
    of users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From the previous diagram you can see that the **Anonymous users** have the
    smallest set of permissions because they have the smallest area of the total diagram.
    This set of permissions is totally encapsulated by the **Forum Moderator users**
    and **Blog Writer users**—meaning that forum moderators and blog writers can do
    everything an anonymous user does, and a whole lot more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the blog writers have a slightly different remit. While they share
    some common permissions with the forum administrators, they also have a few of
    their own. Your permissions as the primary or administrative user encompass the
    entire set, because there should be nothing that you cannot control.

    control with a discussion on users. After all, it is all about what users *can*
    and *cannot* do! The problem with immediately talking about users is that the
    focus of a single user is too narrow, and we can learn far more about controlling
    access by taking a more broad view using roles. Once we have learned everything
    there is to know about roles, actually working with users becomes a trivial matter.

    must always be true to their character—in other words, there is a defined way
    to behave and the character never deviates (no matter which actor portrays the
    character), otherwise the illusion is broken. In the same way, Drupal allows defined
    roles that determine the behavior of a user. Creating a role in Drupal is very
    easy! Simply click the **access control** link under **administer** and select
    the **roles** tab to bring up the following simple interface:'

    user** and the **authenticated user**. It is not possible to change these, and
    so the **Operations** column is permanently set to **locked**. To begin with,
    the anonymous user (this is any user who is browsing the site without logging
    in) has very few permissions set, and you would more than likely want to keep
    it this way despite the fact that it is possible to give them any and all permissions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    than the anonymous user, and it is also sensible to keep these to a minimum. We

    If you are unsure about what name to use, then it is most likely you haven't clearly
    defined what purpose you want that role to serve. To see how this is done, let's
    assume that the *Contechst Wildlife Community* requires a forum moderator who
    will be a normal user in every way except for the ability to work directly on
    **Conservation** forums (to take some of the burden of responsibility off the
    administrator's hands) to create new topics and to edit the content if necessary.
  prefs: []

    role**—actually, you might even want to be more specific and use something like
    **Conservation Forum Moderator user** in this case, but you get the general idea.
    That's it! We have added the role successfully. Now, when you are presented with
    the **roles** page you should be able to view the new role, with the option to
    edit it shown on the right-hand side of the page. You can click **edit** in order

    permissions that the **Forum Moderator user** role will need in order to successfully
    fulfill its purpose. New roles are not given any permissions at all to begin with—this
    makes sense if you think about it, because the last thing we want is to create
    a role only to find that it has the same permissions as the administrative user.

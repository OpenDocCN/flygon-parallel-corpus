- en: Everything we have dealt with so far, as important as it may be in terms of
    creating our own unique site, must take a back seat when it comes to the topic
    of content and content management in Drupal. After all, content *is* what this
    is all about! With the explosion in the number of sites offering dynamic content,
    it is now an absolute necessity to provide meaningful, dynamic, and relevant information
    on your site in order to prosper. How this is done behind the scenes is really
    of no concern to a site's users, but if you can make their browsing experience
    hassle free and relevant to them, they will stick with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*What does hassle free mean in this context?* Content needs to be easy to find,
    which in turn means it needs to be well organized. It needs to be well presented
    and easy to interact with—in other words, simple to use. Most of this is taken
    care of already by Drupal, and for very little additional effort, we can provide
    some very powerful functionality. However, before we look at adding more functionality,
    we should really ensure that we have a good grasp of how to use what is already
    in place.'

    used as a journal or diary, among other things, by individuals. In Drupal, each
    blog writer can, depending on the site''s settings and their permissions, add
    attachments, HTML, or PHP code to their blog.A good example of a blog can be found

    can be used nowadays), which are intended to be used for collaborative authoring.
    Book pages may be added by different people in order to make up one single book,
    which can then be structured into chapters and pages, or in whatever structure
    is most appropriate, provided it is in a hierarchical structure.Because pretty
    much any data type can be added to a book, there is plenty of scope for exciting
    content (think of narrated or visual content complementing dynamic book pages,
    created with PHP and Flash animations, to create a truly unique Internet-based
    book—the possibilities are endless!).A good example of a book is the documentation
    provided for developers on the Drupal site, found at:[http://drupal.org/node/316](http://drupal.org/node/316).
    This has been built up over time by a number of different authors.You will notice
    that if you have the book module enabled, an additional outline tag is presented
    above all/most of the site''s posts. Clicking on this tab allows you to add that
    post to a book—in this way, books can be built up from content posted to the site.

    to decide whether content of certain types coming from certain users needs to
    be moderated before it can be allowed on to the site for general consumption.
    If this is the case, you or a designated user will have the ability to go through
    a moderation queue in order to confirm that any and all the content meets the
    site's requirements.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous screenshot, the content being added is being published directly
    without the need for moderation. Enabling the second option, **In moderation queue**,
    would force the content to be approved before publication. The third option has
    been selected, and this will cause the content being created to appear on the
    front page of the website when it is first published (unless you have set a specific
    node to be displayed here already).

- en: The fourth option, **Sticky at top of lists**, causes the node to remain at
    the top of its list regardless of how many other postings there are. This is extremely
    useful for posting important messages to forums. For example, if there is some
    confusion about how to do something on a given forum, write a note explaining
    how things are done, and select this option to pin it to the top of the forum.

    of the content if it is being updated or revised. This means that you maintain
    the old version of the content as well as making a new version. This is useful
    if you want to keep track of what changes are being made to your documents. If
    a new revision has been created and tracked, then the next time you look at the
    content (assuming you have sufficient permissions) you will notice a new **revisions**

    one (displayed to others) by clicking on **revert**, or you can **delete** revisions
    altogether. Notice that the log message that was added to the content type is
    also displayed at the bottom of each revision. From this you can see that they
    are actually quite important for maintaining good version control in content that
    is often modified. In this case, the log message for the revised version of the
    book page content mentions a change in the title.

    any other content easy is a standard called **Rich Site Summary (RSS)** . This
    allows aggregators (programs that consume RSS feeds) to understand how to present
    content on web pages due to the way in which the RSS feed is structured. Drupal
    comes with one of these aggregators built in—simply enable it in the **modules**
    section under **administer**, and you will find that a few extra menu items pop
    up, allowing you to administer and view the content once it has been added.

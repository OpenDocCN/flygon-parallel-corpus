    require us only to learn which settings to enable and what text to enter. There
    is a fundamental difference between this and what is coming in this chapter, mainly
    because the content in this chapter requires us to think ahead and plan what we
    want ahead of time, in order to prevent things going awry at a later date.

    chapters, you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. The main reason for
    concerning ourselves with categorization is that in order to make Drupal's classification
    system so powerful, it must be left for us to decide how best to implement. This
    might sound a little strange at first, but we will see later on in the chapter
    why this faculty of Drupal is one of the things that distinguish it from everything
    else out there—it's really a good thing!

    types of content. In order to control what is and is not allowed, head on over

    to decide whether people can add certain tags to their content. The answer to
    this is that because both HTML and PHP are such powerful internet technologies,
    it is not hard to subvert even fairly simple abilities for malicious purposes.
    For example, you might decide you would like to allow authenticated users the
    ability to link to their homepages from their blogs. Using the ability to add
    a hyperlink to their postings, a malicious user could create a virus or some other
    harmful content, and link to it from an innocuous and friendly looking piece of

    the extent that if you don't have proper security or disaster-recovery policies
    in place, then it is possible that your site can be rendered useless or destroyed
    entirely. Security is the main reason why, as you may have noticed from the previous

    or any other type of content producer to produce content and leave it at that.

    not generally to remain in obscurity when creating a website, so assuming that

    Each type consists of a set of descriptors, but the relationship between them

    In this case there was a hierarchical relationship between forum containers and
    the forum topics they contained. But what would we need thesauri for? Well, if
    you were working on creating a scientific document and you wanted to allow plenty
    of references between terms so that users could browse related pages, which didn't
    necessarily have child-parent relationships, then you would go for this type of
    structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we know that we can classify content in Drupal, but *why is this useful?*
    One of the things that makes the Drupal taxonomy system so powerful is that it
    allows content to be categorized when it is created. This removes the burden on
    the administrators of the site in terms of manpower, because it is no longer necessary
    to moderate every bit of content coming into the site in order to put it into
    pre-determined categories.
  prefs: []

    can belong to several vocabularies at once. This is very useful for cross-referencing

    be a lot of content posted once the site has been up and running for a few months,

    on the content page instead of just one. In other words, the node has been tagged
    with several descriptors in what is known as **faceted tagging**. Basically, faceted
    tagging uses a *bottom up* system of classification, where facets or properties
    of the content are described by the terms. In this way a very intuitive method
    of classifying content can be created without users needing to understand the
    top-down path of a content hierarchy in order to find the content they are after.
    Ironically, in this case, the specific method of tagging used here helps to elucidate
    the hierarchy of terms too.

    Yet, using only the single vocabulary, there is no way that a user could tell
    which category the **Poaching** term fell under. Doing things this way allows
    users to effectively navigate up a level by visiting **Hunting**, or staying at
    the same level by visiting **Poaching**. But there's a problem with this too.

    The answer lies once again in editing the vocabulary page, which contains a **Required**
    checkbox right at the bottom. If this option is enabled, then posters must select
    at least one tag, but if we leave it unselected, then posters can choose whether
    to include a term from that vocabulary.'

    take a look at quickly. Related terms does nothing on a standard Drupal site at
    the time of writing, although you might wish to play around with the *Glossary*
    module, which makes use of this feature. A related term can be considered to be
    a kind of cross-reference at the *vocabulary level*—as opposed to a synonym, which
    works at the *term level*. **Free tagging** is an interesting option because it
    allows posters to decide on their own terms for their content. Enabling this option
    for the **Hunting** vocabulary, for example, means posters are given the following
    category options when creating a blog entry:'

    This is because despite the fact that we are using free tagging, the **Required**
    option on the **edit vocabulary** page is still enabled—so something *has* to
    be entered here. Secondly, there is a drop-down list of all the tags available
    (starting with whatever letter you type). This means that giving people free reign
    to type in their own tags is not as random as it may at first seem, because they
    can still be guided as to what terms are already available using this drop-down
    list. In this way, Drupal can encourage a more coherent body of descriptors.

    because people can really tag their content exactly as they please—making the
    tagging system fit the content far more snugly. The problem is, however, that
    your vocabulary may well become unwieldy, because similar content could be tagged
    with entirely different descriptors, making it hard for users to find what they
    are looking for. If you are to allow this option, then you should ensure that
    the people who are using it are made aware of the fact that they should tag their
    content sensibly and in as uniform a manner as possible.

    of terms using the free tagging system because every new tag is on the same level

    a taxonomy.

    because if, for example, they clicked on the descriptor name of a post, which
    was only tagged with **clamps**, the page that displays all the posts associated
    with that tag would no doubt display the post we have just added. Because of this,
    the person would be able to see that **Trapping, bear traps**, and **gin-traps**
    are all related topics, and would be able to research related material by hopping
    around from post to post.

    select**. This relates to free tagging in that if you have free tagging enabled,
    it is possible to enter more than one descriptor for each post—you simply separate
    each descriptor with a comma. However, if you want to allow for a more thesaurus-like
    structure of descriptors for your content, without enabling free tagging, you
    would simply enable **Multiple select**, and this would allow users to tag their
    posts with as many descriptors as are made available by the creator of the vocabulary.
    Effectively, this is a middle ground in terms of allowing some flexibility in
    the tagging while retaining control over how content is tagged.

    when we first began working on this section, it may take a little while to get
    the hang of things, because the way in which the categorization works in Drupal

    If you are not already familiar with HTML and PHP, then I recommend you spend
    some time learning a bit about HTML before continuing on with the next chapter.
    That said, you have seen how to create input formats to allow different types
    of HTML or PHP content into your posts, as well as looking at how to create a
    fairly nice HTML-based dynamic web page.

    site, the real nuts and bolts of your content management lesson came with the
    discussion on categorization. Drupal's taxonomy system sets it apart from other
    CMS technologies and provides the flexibility and power to implement pretty much
    any type of structure that we can imagine for our content. With powerful features
    like free tagging available at the click of a button, you are sitting at the controls
    of one of the best systems around.

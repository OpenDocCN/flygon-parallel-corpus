    requires some technical know-how when it comes to Drupal, but like any design-like
    task, it also needs some creativity. Your site as it stands at the moment is fully
    functional and doesn't look awful—it's a bit plain, but it will get the job done!
    As you will see, however, with a bit of effort creating something entirely new
    is not out of your reach, and as you might expect, Drupal comes with a host of
    features to make our lives easier.

    this is really the chapter you have been waiting for. It's time to design, plan,
    and implement the visual environment in which users will *be immersed—if* you
    can succeed in creating a pleasing atmosphere in which to interact, then you will
    certainly have done a lot in terms of ensuring users are happy with your site.

    you to simply make changes here and there to achieve your design goals rather
    than develop the HTML from scratch. To some extent, this luxury actually restricts
    you because anything short of a total rewrite of the pages will mean your site
    retains some of the Drupal *flavor*. But that's not a bad thing at all now, is
    it?

    little bits to play around with, so you should be prepared to spend some time
    on this section because after all, your site's look and feel is really the face

    is already out there. Many issues that you will encounter while designing your
    site have already been successfully dealt with all over the show, and not only
    by Drupal users of course. Also, don't be scared to treat your design as an ongoing
    process—while it is never good to drastically change your site on a weekly basis,
    regular tweaking or upgrading of your interface can keep it modern and looking
    shiny new.

    knowledge, ranging from evolution to biokinetics and engineering. It is a well
    understood concept, which basically says that the way something is built or made
    must reflect the purpose it was made for. This is an exceptionally sensible thought,
    and applying it to the design of your site will provide you with a yardstick to
    measure how well you have designed it. If you, or preferably everyone you ask,
    can honestly say that your site looks like it is meant to do whatever it is you
    are doing, then you are doing a good job.
  prefs: []

    the same function. In fact, if anything, you want to make it as distinctive as
    possible without stepping over the bounds of what you believe your target user
    will consider *good taste* or *common sense*.

    with your specific target audience. If you are providing content that has appeal
    to both sexes of all ages across all nationalities, races, or religions, then
    obviously you should go with something that everyone can use. If anything, this
    might be a slightly flavorless site since you wouldn''t want to marginalize any
    group of users by explicitly making your site friendly to another group. Luckily,
    though, to some extent your target audience will be slightly easier to define
    than this, so you can generally make some concessions for a particular type of
    user.'

    design, what you are really thinking about is the visual or functional aspect
    of the *interaction* design, which encompasses all visual and functional design.
    The interaction design is how you envision your audience using and interacting
    with your site. This is an important distinction because thinking about everything
    from the perspective of the user will help to define your choices as you go along.

    simple as possible without hiding any critical or useful information. By this,
    I mean you shouldn't be afraid to leave a fairly large list of items on a page
    if all the items on that list are useful, and will be (or are) used frequently.
    Hiding an important thing from users—no matter how easy it appears to be to find
    it on other pages—will frustrate them, and your popularity might suffer. A consequence
    of this is that you should not be afraid to have quite long pages that users must
    scroll down—rather have information available at the bottom of the page than have
    a complex navigation structure.

    up into thirds—either vertically or horizontally—are more visually appealing than
    other designs; the visual center rule, which states that the visual center of

    for the Web is a lot more subtle than just saying what you mean. The reason for
    this is that you are no longer writing simply for human consumption, but also
    for consumption by machines. Since machines can only follow a certain number of
    rules when interpreting a page, the concessions on the language used must be made
    by the writers (if they want their sites to feature highly on search engines).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before you worry about making your site's text highly optimized for searching,
    there are a few more fundamental things that you need to get right. First off,
    make sure your language is clear and concise! This is the most important; rather
    sacrifice racy, stylized copy for more mundane text if the mundane text is going
    to elucidate your important points better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from the actual content of your language, the visual and structural appearance
    of the copy is also important. Use bold or larger fonts to emphasize headings
    or important points, and ensure that you space your text out nicely to make the
    page easier on the eye and therefore easier to read and understand—we saw an example
    of this in the previous chapter when we posted a well formatted and laid out "about
    us" page.

    sense that generally you should be quite artistic in order to make nice pictures.
    I mean that actually managing and dealing with image files is itself an art. There
    is a lot of work to be done for the aspiring website owner with respect to attaining
    a pleasing and meaningful visual environment. This is because the Web is the one
    environment that is most reliant on visual images to have an effect on users because
    sight and sound are the only two senses that are targeted by the Internet, for
    now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you really need to use a reasonably powerful image editor. Photoshop or Paint
    Shop Pro are examples of good image-editing environments, but anything that allows
    you to save files in a variety of different formats and provides resizing capabilities
    should be sufficient. Of course, if you have to take digital photographs yourself,
    then you will need to ensure you make the photos as uniform as possible, with
    a background that doesn't distract from the object in question—editing the images
    to remove the background altogether is probably best.

    than text or code. For this reason you need to have an effective method for dealing
    with large images that will be required for your site—simply squashing large images
    into thumbnails will slow everything down because the server still has to upload
    the entire large file to the user's machine.
  prefs:

    early on in the process to make them as uniform in size and type as possible.
    If all your images are of one size and of the same dimension, then you are going
    to have things a lot easier than most. In fact, this should really be your aim
    before you do anything involving the site—make *sure your images are all uniform*.

    can also be a bit of an issue because some image types take up more space than
    others, and some may not even be rendered properly in a browser. By and large
    there are really only three image types that are most commonly used—GIF, PNG,
    and JPG.

    Before we begin an in-depth look at themes, which are responsible for just about
    everything when it comes to your site's look and feel, we will need to take a
    look at how the various web technologies are combined in Drupal to provide your

    applying this knowledge within the context of a Drupal site is another thing entirely.
    Because of this it is important that we take some time to understand exactly how
    everything is tied together. You have already seen that HTML and PHP can and do
    form part of a site's interface, but many of you will have noticed the **themes**
    link under the **administer** menu item and wondered what all that is about.

    each level of the diagram represent a contribution of something to the level above.
    In other words, we can regard PHP, HTML, and CSS as being fundamental technologies
    that provide the base from which theme engines and themes provide HTML to browsers.
    Once a theme has provided the HTML to the browser, the browser renders this to
    the screen for the user to view.
  prefs: []

- en: There are several things to make a note of here. Firstly, not all theme engines
    are pure PHP based. For example, there is a Smarty theme engine available in Drupal
    for use by people who are familiar with Smarty templates. Second, there are many
    types of browser out there, and not all of them are created equal. What this means
    is that a page that is rendered nicely on one browser might look bad, or worse,
    not even function properly on another. For this reason you should *test your site
    using several different browsers!*

    with the intricacies of theme engines. *Can we now move on and look at themes
    directly?* Not yet; notice that in the previous diagram there is a box containing
    the term CSS. This is very important in terms of developing our interface, and

    style sheets, which are held in the site's theme. Using style sheets gives designers
    excellent, fine-grained control over the appearance of web pages, and even allows
    you to produce some great effects. The appearance of pretty much every aspect

    on these links will help you ensure that your layout code is valid. If any problems
    are reported, then it is up to you to ensure that your site complies as closely
    as possible. Unfortunately, if you try this from your development machine you
    will more than likely receive an error message because these services will only
    work on public domains.

- en: One of the most important aspects of customizing a site's look is understanding
    how Drupal is set up in order to leverage the power of themes. As we saw, themes
    provide a kind of template from which you can work to create your own unique site.
    This saves us a lot of time and effort because we no longer need to work from
    scratch. We also briefly touched on the possibility of generating themes from
    theme engines and hopefully you will feel confident enough to begin looking at
    this in more detail once you gain more experience.

    There are three main technologies that you need to spend some time working with:
    HTML, CSS, and PHP. In this chapter we looked at CSS in some detail before setting
    about modifying the style sheet supplied with our chosen base theme. Whatever
    theme you choose as your site''s base, the tasks you face will be similar in nature
    to the ones discussed in this chapter and hopefully you will find that CSS is
    a most powerful and useful weapon in your armory.'

    of the design considerations discussed will help not only with your Drupal site,
    but with any other web‑based application that you end up working with. Gaining
    an appreciation for the various different types of design, as well as having to
    work with images and code, will allow you to create more ambitious graphical user
    interfaces in the future.

    some of the more advanced or interesting features in Drupal in order to give you
    the opportunity to add that *special something* to your site. Whether it is new
    type of content, an advertising policy to generate revenue from traffic, or even
    a way of providing nice, dynamic content, you should find something to add value
    to your site in here.

    or in any of the modules, you are not totally out of luck. The chances are someone
    else in the community has had to do something similar before, and you should get
    a few helpful responses on the forums explaining at least some of what you need.
    If at some point you do manage to create something utterly fantastic, please give
    back to the community by sharing your work with others.

    to a site in order to get it just right. Accordingly, we will look at some interesting
    embellishments using code that is freely available on the Internet. Incorporating
    JavaScript and other small, working units of code (commonly known as widgets)
    is the perfect way to enhance your site without having to learn everything about
    programming first.

    working with your theme files, using HTML, PHP, and CSS, is great training for
    the Web in general and not just Drupal. The *Advanced Site Modifications* section

    an idea of what's involved in implementing them.

    backups of the whole site, including the database, from time to time (preferably
    each time you successfully add a new feature). Further, you should also back up
    each of the pages you are working on before you begin working with them. The topic
    of making backups is discussed in the *Running your Website* chapter, which follows
    this one—I mention this just in case you feel it is time to make a backup of what
    you have now before you begin fiddling around.

    presented by the module or modify the presentation in their theme.

    reservoir of vital statistics pages for endangered animals. In this case, we could
    go to the trouble of building a rough HTML template and use the page content type,
    inserting the relevant data into the various cells in our table. However, this
    would be a pain because if a variety of people were posting this type of information,
    then each of them would have to learn how to use this HTML template. Let's take
    a look how the Flexinode contribution can help out here.

    points. First, we need to actually attach the pages we are going to add to the
    post; otherwise we will not be able to add them to the page. The next is to actually
    tag a section of the page with the `containerid` tag.

    to go with it. So, for the purposes of this demo we will add a few pages of interesting
    content. The first page is a bit of news:'

    was saved as `09_02_news.txt` on the file system. The reason for this is that
    when the file attachment is uploaded and attached to the post, you will still
    need to be able to clearly see which material is the most outdated when the time
    comes to remove it. The next file is just a bit of plain old content, which we
    won't bother to list here.

    entitled **quick pick**. The first thing that we must do is attach the two content
    files to this post. Once that is done, ensure that you unselect the **List** options
    for both. Leaving these files listed would defeat the purpose of the page entirely.
    Next, the most important thing to do is take note of the names of the files that
    have been saved by Drupal. You can check these in the **File attachments** section
    as follows:'

    other entitled `Plain Old Content`. Within the links, the `ajaxpage` function
    is referenced and it is passed the names of the attached files as well as the
    `id` of the page element where the content of each page is to be displayed. A
    little further down you can see that we have declared a table cell with the `id`
    attribute set to `contentarea`, so this is where the dynamic content is going
    to be displayed.

    to keep the attached files' sizes small so that users don't click on a link and
    then lose interest waiting for it to be displayed. If you want a bit of a challenge,
    write a PHP script that converts the`<body>` section of other posts into a file
    so that you can add interesting posts or articles without having to manually create
    the attached content files.

    whatever important tasks you might have.

    modules available for us. Hopefully, you will find that you now know enough about
    the use of modules to feel confident in using any one you choose. Ultimately,
    you might end up creating and sharing your own modules for use by other members
    of the community, but for now, being able to generate a bit of cash on the side
    using AdSense as well as create your own custom content types should give you
    plenty to work with.

    on the Internet in order to find complete solutions, or even partial code pieces
    that can be modified and/or incorporated into your site in order to give some
    great functionality. This has hopefully highlighted the fact that even if you
    aren't a programming expert, with a bit of searching and some basic knowledge
    of a few important web-based technologies, you can create some powerful features
    for your site.

    something you want to add that was not discussed directly here, you should find
    that you have enough general experience to go ahead and make whatever changes
    you want. Gaining the confidence to create an advanced website is simply about
    taking the time to learn your way around things, and this book has given you the
    platform from which to start.

    website, and doesn't relate to the development of your site as directly as these
    first nine have. Because of this, I would like to take the time to congratulate
    you on finishing your website now, as well as assure you that all the hard development
    work is done.

    how to properly deploy your new site to its home on the Web. You can always come
    back to [Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Running Your Website") and learn how
    to maintain and administer your site once it is up and running.

    should also feel confident that, from a development perspective, you can respond
    to whatever demands the site throws at you and work with Drupal with a high degree
    of proficiency. Like all things in the computing world, however, it is never sufficient
    to build something and then leave your creation to run by itself. There is always
    work to be done to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

    hope to cover each and every nuance of the huge array of different platforms on
    which Drupal can be run. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer wildly varying
    packages, which can either be totally bereft of any type of helpful functionality,
    or packed full with all the latest gadgets—most ISPs offer a large variety of
    packages under one roof.

    in the event you do not have access to the same software, will clearly demonstrate
    the tasks you need to perform so that you can still successfully operate with
    the software you *do have access to*. For example, by using the Apache2Triad package,
    we already have certain useful technologies that we can make use of on the development
    machine, such as phpMyAdmin.

    As mentioned several times throughout the course of the book, you should back
    up anything that is at risk of being damaged whenever you modify code, or add
    a new module, or even upgrade versions of Drupal. It sounds like a real pain to
    do this because the vast majority of the time, nothing goes wrong with the application.
    However, sooner or later, for some unfathomable reason, if you don't make backups,
    you *will* get stung in precisely the most painful spot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most especially, corrupting or breaking a database, which in turn leads to a
    loss of precious data, can be a real pain in the… back end of your application!
    So, while it is fairly easy to back up the files on the file system by simply
    making copies of the directories in question, or indeed copying the entire `drupal`
    folder (whatever you have named it), it is of paramount importance that you learn
    how to back up the database too, because this is not as trivial—it will become
    easy with practice, though.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before continuing, it is important to have a *strategy* for backing up files,
    folders, and data. It is good idea to back up the entire site at regular intervals,
    as well as backing up the database even more frequently. These backups should
    be clearly marked so that you know when they were made, making it easy to determine
    which one to use in the event of some sort of disaster. You might also consider
    holding these backups away from the main file system, perhaps on a CD, so that
    if something really bad happens, you don't have to rely on your host's disaster-recovery
    policy; you have your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    also made easier with the interface for many of the most commonplace data-related

    utility if they find they need to implement it. Windows users need to go a step
    further and download a patch utility first. Luckily there is a download of common
    Unix utilities available at [http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/).
    This contains the patch utility among other things, and you will need to extract
    the content to a folder—the `patch.exe` file will be within the `usr\local\wbin`
    folder in whichever directory you extracted the files to.

    If you would like to use `patch` from anywhere on the command line, you need to
    add its file path to your **Path** system variable—otherwise, you would have to
    navigate to the `usr\local\wbin` folder on the command line before using `patch`
    each time (you could alternatively add `patch.exe` to a folder already in your
    **Path**, but it is probably better to keep everything separate).

    you spend some time finding out what is available for you to use and how to use

    find your site. *What type of words would they use to find a site like yours?*
    Once you have come up with a list of key words and phrases, ensure that the writing
    on your site makes use of these phrases whenever possible.If you are using Google
    AdWords, then you can check the popularity of various search terms yourself—simply
    put them forward as potential target keywords and check on their stats, which
    Google provides before they are added.For example, if you had a site that deals
    with mobile gadgets, and you wanted to make the phrase **cellular phone** a term
    that you rank highly on, then instead of writing something like:**This device
    can be used to call other people**, you should write:**This G1 super cellular
    phone, can call any other cellular phone from wherever you are**.Admittedly, you
    cannot control the content of other people''s comments and pages, but this would
    still apply to any and all standard pages you write—such as the *introduction*
    page, *about us*, or *FAQ*, or even your own personal blog. |'

- en: '| Use meaningful file names | While this is not as important as the first point,
    it certainly will help to have everything named meaningfully, because search engines
    do look at file names. Instead of naming a page `19`, you should name it something
    like `awesome_webpage.html`. Don''t go overboard on this because it is not too
    important.Look through the modules available with help for renaming files if this

    place a large amount of emphasis on the anchor text used in links. As a result,

    you would rewrite the following sentence:`Donate to the Wildlife community <a
    href ="<yourlink>">here</a>`.to:`Donate to the <a href ="<yourlink>">Wildlife
    community</a> here`.The reason for this is that the word **here** is not particularly
    meaningful to a search engine, even though humans can easily make the connection.
    For the sake of your rankings, simply move the link to the key phrase **Wildlife
    community** to place more emphasis on it for the search engine. |'

    that you should consider making use of are the `keyword` and `description` tags.
    For example, the following shows a possible tag:`<meta name="keywords" content="CWC
    wildlife conservation biosphere">`Metatags have been the subject of some abuse,
    and you should view the W3C consortium''s guidelines for their usage: `http://www.w3.org`.In
    order to make these changes, you would have to work with your theme—most likely
    the `page.tpl` file, or whatever is its equivalent! |'

    perceived popularity of a website. Search engines can judge the popularity of
    a website by looking at how many links there are to the site, and how popular
    the sites that link to it themselves are. For this reason, you should ensure that
    you link to and link from only sites that you feel are suitable partners.Effectively,
    you should search for as many relevant link pages as possible, or actually speak
    to the relevant sites to determine whether you can provide mutual links. The more
    links you have from popular sites, the better your ranking will be. You can also
    try to get one-way links to your site—these are also rated highly by search engines.

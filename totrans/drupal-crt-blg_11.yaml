- en: The big day has finally arrived! By the end of this appendix your site will
    be live, and only a few minor deployment issues now stand in between you and your
    online aspirations. *Actually that's not quite true!* I should make it clear that
    there's nothing particularly complex about deployment; it's just that you need
    to keep on top of a lot of different issues. Making silly errors at this stage
    can have dramatic effects on the final product because we are dealing mainly with
    configuration issues when we deploy a fully developed application. Of course,
    making errors is not the end of the world, because we are going to test everything
    very thoroughly.

- en: At first glance, deploying a site like Drupal has got to be pretty easy—it's
    just a case of copying the `drupal` folder over to the new server! *Or is it?*
    There are a number of concerns that go hand in hand with ensuring everything goes
    smoothly during the transfer. For example, the database will also have to be rebuilt
    exactly as it is on the development machine—I'm sure that since most of you have
    spent some time configuring everything and populating tables, you'll be anxious
    to not have to do everything all over again. Apart from this, there are the connection
    parameters and some security issues to think about.

    before deleting anything, just to be safe. Then remove all backup files from the
    `drupal` folders.

    brand-new installation with files you don't need?* You will find that it is a
    constant battle to keep everything neat and tidy as you go anyway—so start as
    you mean to go on. Finally, if you have worked on a lot of files over the course
    of the development phase, you are adding a lot of unnecessary size to the upload.

    of the `update.php` script, then you can add it back to the site then.

    and password. As you can probably deduce, the current database name and password
    will change to the ones you set when you created a new database on your host (if
    they're not the same), but there is no point in transferring any type of sensitive
    information like this—especially since people often prefer to use the same username
    and password for a variety of things.

- en: If you are working on a Linux box, you can **tar** and **gzip** your files if
    you wish—it will obviously help with the upload time. If you are developing on
    Windows, then you might want to make sure that your host can unzip `.zip` files
    since they will more than likely be using a Linux server—there shouldn't be a
    problem, however. In the unlikely event that there is, the best thing to do is
    download and install a gzip utility for Windows at[http://www.gzip.org/](http://www.gzip.org/)

- en: For a task as important as building a full-featured community-driven website,
    it is necessary that you spend a lot of time considering your options, and developing
    and testing your site. Since it is not really feasible to do this sort of work
    on the live site, you need to employ a development machine to aid you. Because
    of this, the topic of deployment is an important one in the overall scheme of
    things because it is deployment that actually links your finished development
    to the live site.

  zh: 对于构建一个功能齐全的社区驱动网站这样重要的任务，你需要花费大量时间考虑你的选择，并开发和测试你的网站。因为在实际网站上做这种工作并不现实，你需要使用开发机来帮助你。因此，部署的话题在整体方案中是一个重要的话题，因为部署实际上将你完成的开发与实际网站联系起来。
- en: This chapter outlined a solid process for preparing for deployment. It was also
    necessary to set up a new database on the host site, but this proved to be relatively

- en: Hopefully you came to realize that the deployment process itself is not particularly
    complex for a Drupal site, since the only real configuration work that needs to
    be done is modifying the `settings.php` file to reflect your new system's configuration.

    file is a real advantage for Drupal users.

- en: While the actual deployment of the site is fairly simple, it was shown that
    there were quite a few issues to deal with, and not the least of them is testing.

    site needs.

  zh: 虽然网站的实际部署相当简单，但是已经显示出有相当多的问题需要处理，其中最重要的是测试。在网站上线之前，必须进行全面的测试，因为由于愚蠢的错误失去宝贵的用户是任何竞争激烈的网站最不希望看到的事情。

    be live, and only a few minor deployment issues now stand in between you and your
    online aspirations. *Actually that's not quite true!* I should make it clear that
    there's nothing particularly complex about deployment; it's just that you need
    to keep on top of a lot of different issues. Making silly errors at this stage
    can have dramatic effects on the final product because we are dealing mainly with
    configuration issues when we deploy a fully developed application. Of course,
    making errors is not the end of the world, because we are going to test everything
    very thoroughly.

- en: At first glance, deploying a site like Drupal has got to be pretty easy—it's
    just a case of copying the `drupal` folder over to the new server! *Or is it?*
    There are a number of concerns that go hand in hand with ensuring everything goes
    smoothly during the transfer. For example, the database will also have to be rebuilt
    exactly as it is on the development machine—I'm sure that since most of you have
    spent some time configuring everything and populating tables, you'll be anxious
    to not have to do everything all over again. Apart from this, there are the connection
    parameters and some security issues to think about.

    it is?* While it is not a huge problem to make modifications to your site after
    deployment, there is no point in making things hard for yourself by having to
    recode some pages or make design changes then, when you can get them done now.
    If everything is in order, then we can begin with the preparation process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that we have a nice, clean, working version of the site, a nice, clean, working
    copy of the database, and finally, a nice, clean file system ready for the files
    on the host site. Let's take a look at how this is done.

    I mean you have a host on which you can *create a MySQL database*, and that allows
    *access to a file system*, and whatever other goodies you think you may need.
    To make your life easy, it is also nice to have an FTP account available so that
    you can transfer files across to the host file system. More often than not, you
    should be able to log on to your FTP account with your administrator''s username
    and password automatically. If you''re not sure what all this is about, then try
    the following URL in your browser (assuming your browser supports FTP):'

    how to secure file transfers.'

    and something to do it with, you need to create a database. Goodness only knows
    how many different ways this can be done in; so we won't go into each and every
    one here.

    and with that, the host site is pretty much ready to receive the new Drupal website.
    Remember, these usernames, passwords, and database names are all important for
    the configuration of the site, so ensure that you don't forget any of them. If
    you get stuck, get help from your host's support team; that's what they are there
    for.

    extracted directly to the `public_html` folder on the live site.

    as you work. As far as Windows machines go, these are denoted by `.bak`, and placed
    in the same folder as the original file. Make a backup of your `drupal` folder
    before deleting anything, just to be safe. Then remove all backup files from the
    `drupal` folders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it might seem a bit excessive to do this at the moment, there are a couple
    of good reasons for it. First, having any sort of unused files lying around on
    your host file system is poor security practice. Second, *why clutter up your
    brand-new installation with files you don't need?* You will find that it is a
    constant battle to keep everything neat and tidy as you go anyway—so start as
    you mean to go on. Finally, if you have worked on a lot of files over the course
    of the development phase, you are adding a lot of unnecessary size to the upload.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For security reasons, you should probably move your `CHANGELOG.txt` file and
    `update.php` files to a different location—take them out of the website and hold
    them elsewhere, where hackers can't get hold of them. If you need to make use
    of the `update.php` script, then you can add it back to the site then.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, open up the configuration file, `settings.php`, and remove the username
    and password. As you can probably deduce, the current database name and password
    will change to the ones you set when you created a new database on your host (if
    they're not the same), but there is no point in transferring any type of sensitive
    information like this—especially since people often prefer to use the same username
    and password for a variety of things.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once this is done, you have to wait until the next section to add one more file
    and you can then make a master, zipped copy of your Drupal site—call it RTP (Release
    to Public) or something similar to distinguish it from other versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are working on a Linux box, you can **tar** and **gzip** your files if
    you wish—it will obviously help with the upload time. If you are developing on
    Windows, then you might want to make sure that your host can unzip `.zip` files
    since they will more than likely be using a Linux server—there shouldn't be a
    problem, however. In the unlikely event that there is, the best thing to do is
    download and install a gzip utility for Windows at[http://www.gzip.org/](http://www.gzip.org/)
    , which you can then use to zip up your files in the `.gz` format.

    testing, or it may hold a few important pages. There's no hard and fast rule here;
    just try not to transfer over a whole lot of stuff that you will end up deleting
    straight away anyway.
  prefs: []

    to deploy the database, you will need to make a backup of it. It is this backup
    file that is then transferred across to the host site and used to create a new
    database there. Since you already have all the information you need regarding
    backups, we need look at them no further here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have created your backup file of the entire Drupal database and added
    the resulting `.sql` file somewhere to the `drupal` folder (anywhere will do so
    long as you can find it again), you are now ready to begin transferring files
    across to your host. Note that you should remove the `.sql` file from your site
    as soon as you have made use of it—hold it somewhere out of the document root
    in case you need to use it again.

    of the database, all zipped up and ready to go. Assuming there are images and
    a fair bit of data held within the site, you can be sure that the size of the
    upload is quite substantial. For this reason, you need a reasonably high speed
    connection—dial-up connections can be slightly erratic over long periods of time,
    so it may even be worth using a friend's computer or your office connection to
    send the files to the host site.

    about how to transfer files. The administrative interface and file manager for

    files. Because of this, we won't waste time discussing FTP utilities in detail.
    Simply ensure that, ultimately, the ZIP file ends up in the document root of your
    host's server. Remember not to leave the zip folder lying around in the document

- en: For a task as important as building a full-featured community-driven website,
    it is necessary that you spend a lot of time considering your options, and developing
    and testing your site. Since it is not really feasible to do this sort of work
    on the live site, you need to employ a development machine to aid you. Because
    of this, the topic of deployment is an important one in the overall scheme of
    things because it is deployment that actually links your finished development
    to the live site.

    necessary to set up a new database on the host site, but this proved to be relatively
    easy because any good host makes the task fairly simple by providing a tool like
    phpMyAdmin to work with the database.

    complex for a Drupal site, since the only real configuration work that needs to
    be done is modifying the `settings.php` file to reflect your new system's configuration.
    Having the complexity of the site's deployment reduced to configuring a single
    file is a real advantage for Drupal users.

- en: While the actual deployment of the site is fairly simple, it was shown that
    there were quite a few issues to deal with, and not the least of them is testing.
    It is critical that a full suite of tests is carried out on any site before it
    goes live—losing valuable users to silly errors is the last thing that any competitive
    site needs.

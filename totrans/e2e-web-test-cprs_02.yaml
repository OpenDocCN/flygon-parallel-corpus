    modern web applications. It focuses on eliminating inconsistencies in tests by
    ensuring that you can write, debug, and run tests on the browser without needing
    additional configuration or additional packages. Cypress works as a standalone
    application and can be installed on macOS, Unix/Linux, and Windows operating systems
    either using Hyphenate applications or command-line tools. Cypress was mainly
    built for developers who write their applications using JavaScript because it
    can be used to test all applications that run on a browser. In this chapter, we
    are going to cover the following topics:'

    tools such as Selenium and how it stands out when it comes to web automation testing.
    In this chapter, we will build on our knowledge of using Cypress using command-line
    tools. To do this, we will cover commands that you can use to make use of Cypress'
    functionality.

    tests, debugging Cypress, and launching Cypress tests on different browsers, among
    other Cypress command-line functions. We will be referencing the GitHub repository
    folder for this chapter, and every command and piece of code that will be written
    will be included in the repository for your reference and practice.

    than running them using the browser. This is because running tests through the
    command line reduces the number of resources required to run a specific test.
    The reason for this is that tests that run in the command line are normally headless,
    which means less resources are allocated to run the tests, which is not the same
    for test execution in headed mode.

    the `npm install cypress` command. If Cypress is run without a project being initialized,
    Cypress' directories will not be visible. By running the `init` command, cypress
    recognizes the project directory as an existing project, so it initializes and
    creates its directories without us needing to run additional commands on the Terminal.

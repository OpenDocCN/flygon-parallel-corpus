    we can now move on and look at the features that make test writing interesting
    in Cypress, such as auto-reload.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, Cypress watches for file changes and reloads the tests immediately
    when a file change is detected. This only happens if Cypress is running. The Cypress
    auto-reload feature comes in handy because you do not need to rerun the tests
    once you've made changes to their test files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the auto-reload feature, it is possible to have instant feedback and understand
    whether their changes were successful or whether their tests are failing. Due
    to this, this feature allows you to save time that would have otherwise been used
    for debugging tests or checking whether the changes that were made fixed the problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'While Cypress'' auto-reload feature is enabled by default, you may opt to turn
    it off and manually rerun the tests after making a change. Cypress allows you
    to stop watching for file changes. This can either be done by configuring the
    `cypress.json` file or by using Cypress'' command-line configuration options.
    When using the `cypress.json` configuration file, the setting you must use to
    disable watching for file changes is as follows:'

    is running, unless the configuration is altered or changed to `true`. The other
    option when it comes to disabling Cypress watching for the file changes is to
    use the command-line configuration option shown here:'

- en: With this command, Cypress will temporarily stop watching for file changes,
    and will only change this behavior when we stop the execution of Cypress on our
    terminal window. Cypress will then continue to watch for file changes and auto-reload
    whenever changes are made to a test file.

- en: In this section, we learned how Cypress utilizes the auto-reload feature to
    watch for file changes and immediately reload and rerun when any changes take
    place in our test files. We also learned how to easily turn off the auto-reload
    feature in Cypress either by permanently disabling it using the `cypress.json`
    file or by passing the command in the command-line configuration when running
    our tests. Next, we will be looking at Cypress assertions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we learned in the previous section, when writing our first test, assertions
    exist to describe the desired state of the application. Assertions in Cypress
    behave like guards to the tests in that they validate that the desired state and
    the present state are the same. Cypress assertions are unique as they are retried
    when Cypress commands are running until a timeout is reached or until an element
    is found.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cypress assertions originate from the **chai**, **chai-jquery** and **sinon-chai**
    modules, which come bundled with the Cypress installation. Cypress also allows
    you to write custom assertions using the Chai plugins. However, in this section,
    we will focus on the default assertions that come bundled with Cypress, and not
    on the custom assertions that can be extended as plugins.

    subjects or by implicitly defining subjects. Cypress recommends implicitly defining
    subjects in assertions as they are immediate to the element that the Cypress commands
    are working on. The following are how assertions are classified in the Cypress
    framework:'

    act on the immediately yielded subjects from Cypress. The commands can also be
    chained with other Cypress commands, which makes them easy to work with while
    at the same time guaranteeing an immediate response when invoking them. The following
    code block demonstrates how to test implicit subjects. Here, we will use the output
    of the `cy.get` command to make assertions in our test:'

    the Todo items has a placeholder value. The `should` command is chained from the
    `cy.get()` command. This not only makes it easy to work with, but also reduces
    the amount of code that is required to assert that the placeholder is what it
    is. In the following code block, we are combining different assertions of an implicit
    subject that will be returned by the `cy.get` command:'

    element that was just yielded has both a placeholder and a CSS class called `new-todo`.
    With these implicit assertions, we can verify that by using implicit subjects,
    we can chain off multiple commands from the same yielded response from Cypress,
    and also assert different items. The following code block shows code assertions
    that have been made by using explicit subjects where we have to declare each subject
    that we are asserting:'

    to be on the same line and acted upon individually.

    running a test. Explicit subjects are common in **unit tests** and are great when
    there is a need to perform some logic before we perform the assertion or even
    have several assertions for the same subject. The following code block shows explicit
    subject assertion using the `expect` method:'

    can be asserted more than once and also manipulated before it performs the assertions.

- en: 'For complex assertions, we can use the `.should()` method to assert explicit
    subjects. This allows a callback function to be passed with the subject that has
    been yielded as the first argument. We can add assertions inside the `should`
    function like so:'

    the need arises.

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to classify tests in Cypress by understanding
    what passing, failing, and skipped tests mean and how Cypress views and represents
    tests in the test runner and command log. We also learned about the structure
    of the test file and the acceptable file extensions for Cypress tests. We then
    wrote our first practical tests, which tested that a Todo application can add,
    delete, and mark a Todo as completed. The highlight of this chapter was learning
    how Cypress watches for file changes and how we can carry out our assertions in
    Cypress either by explicitly asserting our test subjects or implicitly asserting
    them. By completing this chapter, you know how to write a basic test in Cypress
    by working with elements and understanding the assertions that are available.
    In the next chapter, we will learn how to debug running tests in Cypress and the
    tools that we can use for that purpose.

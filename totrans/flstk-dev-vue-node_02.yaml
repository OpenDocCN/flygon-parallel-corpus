    to use Node.js and leverages its power. In this chapter, we will be creating an
    application using solely Express.js. Express.js is also a `node` package. We can
    use an application generator tool, which lets us create a skeleton of an express
    app easily, or we can simply create one ourselves from scratch.

    for an Express.js application. One such package is `express-generator`. This lets
    us scaffold the whole application in seconds. It will create all the necessary
    files and folders in a modular structure. It generates the file structures in
    such a way that is very easy to understand. The only thing that we need to do is
    to define the template views and the routes.

    for client-side scripting, but Node.js enables JavaScript to be used on the server
    side as well. The invention of Node.js introduced the use of a single programming
    language in web applications. Node.js brings with it a lot of benefits, some of
    which are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    one to another. Node.js uses event-driven programming, which means it uses a user''s
    interactive actions, such as mouse clicks, and key presses, to change the state
    of objects.'

- en: '**Non-blocking I/O**: The non-blocking I/O, or non-synchronous I/O, means an
    asynchronous I/O. A synchronous process waits until the current running process
    is completed and, hence, blocks the process. On the other hand, the asynchronous process
    does not need to wait for that process to finish, which makes it fast and reliable
    as well.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Single threading**: Single threading means that JavaScript runs in only a
    single event loop. Since an asynchronous process allows us to have multiple processes
    concurrently, it may seem like all these processes run in their own specific thread.
    But Node.js handles asynchronous a little differently. The event loop in Node.js
    triggers the next callback function that is scheduled for execution after the
    corresponding event has occurred.'

    It is an open source project written in C++. This engine is used for both client-
    and server-side web applications with JavaScript.

    code tells Node.js to run the web server in the 8080 port. The `function` parameter
    in the `createServer` method takes two arguments, `req` and `res`, which are the
    short form of request and response respectively. The first thing that we need
    to do inside that function is to set the HTTP header. This is basically defining
    what type of response we want from that request. Then, we define what we want
    to get in the response by using `res.send`. Finally, we ask the web server to
    listen to port 8080.

    the files. As we go on building the application, we will have a whole lot of files,
    which can get messy. MVC allows for having parallel naming conventions across
    different folders, which can lead to the same filenames inside different folders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can work on such filenames as well if that is what we find to be easy and
    maintainable. Otherwise, we can just append the type of filename to each file, as
     in the following example; for a controller file to handle the user-related activities,
    we can leave it as `controllers/users.js`, or we can rename it to `controllers/users_controller.js`.
    We will be using `controllers/users` for our application.

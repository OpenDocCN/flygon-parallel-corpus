- en: Vue.js is an open source, progressive JavaScript framework for building user
    interfaces. The rise of new JavaScript frameworks has been tremendous. With such
    growth, you might get confused about where to get started and how. There are hundreds
    of JavaScript frameworks today; among them, there are dozens of frameworks that
    stood out. But still, to choose from those dozens might be a daunting task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are quite a few popular frameworks today, such as React, Ember, and Angular.
    While these frameworks have their own advantages, there are some limitations to
    them as well. While building an application with React or Angular is good in itself,
    Vue.js helps eliminate some of the limitations associated with these frameworks.

- en: Vue.js is **progressive.** With Vue.js, you can start with small and then progress
    gradually toward building bigger applications. This means that if you are just
    starting out, you might want to start with a very small application and scale
    slowly. Vue.js is perfect for such applications. It is lightweight and flexible
    as well. The learning curve is also very easy and super easy to get started.
  prefs: []

- en: Vue.js was invented by Evan You. It was first released in February 2014 and
    gained huge popularity around 2016\. He used to work for Google and in Angular
    projects. The motivation for this invention was mainly because he didn't want
    to use Angular for small projects, since Angular provides a lot of packages out
    of the box and, hence, is not lightweight and not suitable for small applications.
    Having said that, Vue.js does not only target the smaller applications. It definitely
    does not provide all the packages with it, but you can add them as you progress
    with your application. That is the beauty of Vue.js.

    Let's move ahead to add the functionality to rate the movie. For this, we will
    be using a package called `vue-star-rating`, which makes it easy to add the rating
    component. You can find this example on this link as well at `https://jsfiddle.net/anteriovieira/8nawdjs7/`.

    lists the movies followed by adding the dynamic functionality to a movies listing
    via a form that stores the movies in the MongoDB. We also learned about Vue.js
    components, Data Binding, and Vue.js Directives.

    secure the applications we build. Every application needs some kind of mechanism
    for authentication. It helps us to identify the users making requests to the application

    to configure authentication efficiently, taking a very small amount of time. If
    you want to learn and develop all by yourself, I encourage you to do so. That
    will give you more insights into how everything works. However, for this book,
    we will use this awesome tool called `passport.js`, which is very easy to integrate

    page. We have a way of adding these movies to the database via the frontend as
    well. Now, since this will be a public web application, we cannot allow everyone
    to add movies by themselves without logging in. Only a user who logs in will have
    access and be able to add movies. Also, in order to rate a movie, a user should
    log in first and then rate the movie.

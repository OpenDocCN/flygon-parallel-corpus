- en: In this chapter, we'll learn about Redux and React Router. Redux is still the
    most common method of managing global state shared across a React application.
    Using Redux global state, we can reduce a great deal of boilerplate code and streamline
    the application. React Router is also the most popular framework for managing
    client-side URL routing. Client-side URL routing allows a SPA application to behave
    in ways that are familiar to users expecting a classic-style web application that
    indicates where they are in the app. Both of these technologies are necessary
    for building SPA applications that look and feel like standard web apps.

- en: Redux is still the most popular enterprise-level framework for creating and
    managing global state in a React application (although we can use Redux in any
    JavaScript app, not just React). Many newer frameworks have been created, and
    some of them have gained their own considerable following; however, Redux is still
    the most commonly used. You may find that Redux is difficult to understand at
    first. However, once we do learn it, we'll see its many benefits and why it is
    so often the go-to framework for large, complex React applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We learned about React state in [*Chapter 4*](B15508_04_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072),
    *Learning Single-Page Application Concepts and How React Enables Them*, and [*Chapter
    5*](B15508_05_Final_JC_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081), *React Development with Hooks*.
    So, to reiterate, state, or a component's data, is the main driver of all UI changes
    in React. This is the reason why the React framework has the word "react" in its
    name, because it is reacting to these state changes (this is also known as being
    reactive). So, when creating and managing state, we generally want to associate
    local state with the component or the component's root parent most of the time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Component-based state can be limiting. There are cases where state is not specific
    to a component or even to a component hierarchy. State can sometimes be necessary
    for several components or other non-component services that make up an application.
    In addition to this, state in React is passed down only one way, from the parent
    down to children as props. It should not be done upstream. And this further constrains
    how state can be used in React. Redux therefore provides a mechanism not only
    to share state globally but also to allow injection and updating of state from
    any component as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's give an example to flesh this out a bit. In a typical enterprise-class
    application, we will always have authentication. And once a user is authenticated,
    we may receive certain data about the user – for example, the user's full name,
    user ID, email, and so on. It should not seem unreasonable to think that these
    data points may be used by a significant portion of the components within an application.
    It would be tedious and error-prone therefore to have each component call to get
    this data and then save it locally in their own state. Doing it this way would
    mean that there were multiple copies of the data and as it changed, some components
    may end up keeping older versions of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sort of conflict can be the source of bugs. Therefore, it would be helpful
    to be able to maintain this data on the client in only one place and share it
    with whatever component needed it. This way, if this data ever did get updated,
    we could be assured that all components, no matter what section of the app they
    are in, would get the latest valid data. This is what Redux can do for our application.
    We can consider it a **single source of truth**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Redux is a data storage service that maintains all the globally shared data
    in our React application. Redux provides not only the store itself, but also the
    base functions needed to add, remove, and share this data. One difference with
    React state, however, is that Redux state is not necessarily going to trigger
    UI updates. It certainly can if we desire to do so, but there is no explicit necessity
    for doing so. So, we should keep that in mind.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Redux, there is only a single store for all data. So, all our global data
    will live inside of a single Redux object. Now, the issue with this design is
    that, since this is global state, different app features will require different
    types of data and the entirety of the data is not always relevant to all parts
    of the application. So, the Redux creators came up with a scheme that uses reducers
    to filter and split up the single store into separated chunks. So, if component
    A only needs a specific piece of data, it does not have to deal with the entire
    store.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This design is a good way of separating data concerns. But the side effect of
    having such a design is that we need some way of updating the relevant portion
    of data without affecting any of the other pieces. This is what actions do. Actions
    are objects that provide the data for specific reducers only.

    way down for every component hierarchy, it would be quite a bit of code, especially
    knowing that some hierarchies involve passing functions that may call back to
    some arbitrary parent. Having these sorts of prop relationships also causes additional
    cognitive load for developers, as they need to think about data relationships
    and how data is being moved among the components.

    well. However, for larger projects, I recommend against using Context.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React Context can have multiple parent providers, meaning it is possible to
    have more than one root context. For larger apps, this can be confusing and adds
    more boilerplate code. Additionally, the mixing of global state providers can
    be confusing. If a team decides to use both Context and Redux, when do we use
    each one? And if we use both now, we must maintain two styles for global state
    management.
  prefs: []

    users of Context will receive the entire set of state data, which is not a good

- en: As you can see, our `UserNameComp` component keeps getting re-rendered, even
    when we only change the `localState` variable. Why is this happening? `TestContext`
    is a component just like any other React component. And it does not use `memo`.
    So, when the parent component, `ContextTester`, gets re-rendered, it also gets
    re-rendered, which has a knock-on effect for any of its children. This is why
    `UserNameComp` keeps getting re-rendered although it never uses the `userage`
    variable.

    In other words, a route in React Router is a logical representation of a virtual

    actually exist on any server). The "routers" in React Router act as parent components

- en: So, as I stated at the beginning of the section, React Router routes are React
    components. This may seem weird as they have no visible UI. Nevertheless, they
    are parent components, except they render their children but have no UI of their
    own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, we know that when our app first loads, it is the `index.tsx` file that
    runs before anything else. And this is also where the core React Router service
    lives. When this service encounters a URL, it looks through the set of routes
    defined in our `App.tsx` file and selects a matching route. Once the matching
    route is selected, that route's child component is rendered. So, for example,
    the route with `path="/b"` would render the `ScreenB` component.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's drill into the details of our routing code. If we look back at our routes,
    we should see that our first route has a property called `exact`. This tells React
    Router not to use regular expressions in determining a route match but instead
    to look for an exact match. Next, we see a property called `path`, which of course
    is supposed to be our URL path after the root domain. This path is by default
    a "contains" path, meaning that any URL that contains the same value as the `path`
    property will be accepted and the first matching route will be rendered, unless
    we included the `exact` property.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, you will also notice that we have a property called `component`, which
    of course refers to the child component that is to be rendered. And for simple
    scenarios, using this property works fine. But what if we need to pass some additional
    props to our component? React Router provides another property called `render`,
    which allows us to use what's called a **render property**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the parent component does its rendering, it will call the `render` function internally.

    characteristic to note about how React Router works. React Router acts basically
    like a stack of URLs. In other words, when a user visits the URLs of a site, they
    do so in a linear fashion. They go to A, then B, and maybe back to A, then C,
    and so on. And the result of this is that the browser history of a user can be
    saved as a stack, where you can go forward to a new URL or backward to a previously
    visited one. This characteristic of browser behavior is mostly maintained in React
    Router's `history` object.

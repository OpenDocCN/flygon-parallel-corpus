    referential transparency of our whole application. If you consider your application
    as one big function, feeding data on the command line could be considered as its

    impure, since two subsequent retrievals of the data could lead to different values.

- en: The canonical Haskell way to solve this issue is to use the **IO monad**. Instead
    of performing its operations immediately, the IO monad stores all steps in a queue.
    If you name this IO operation `main`, Haskell will know it has to run it when
    the compiled program is executed.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Obviously, the application itself is not pure anymore if you perform any kind
    of IO operation inside the monad. However, the code itself can be written in a
    referentially transparent way. It's the Haskell runtime that will perform all
    impure operations when the IO monad is run and will then pass the various obtained
    values around. Using this trick, you can write pure functional code with all the
    benefits it brings and still perform IO operations.

- en: Instead of directly creating the representation of your animation as it is usually

    First we will need to install the required library. We will use a small wrapper
    around ReachPHP''s stream library to make it usable with RxPHP so we can demonstrate
    accessing files on disk. The following `composer` invocation should install all
    needed dependencies:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在对ReactiveX进行了非常简要的介绍之后，让我们看看它如何被使用。首先，我们需要安装所需的库。我们将使用一个小的包装器来包装ReachPHP的流库，以使其可以与RxPHP一起使用，这样我们就可以演示访问磁盘上的文件。以下`composer`调用应该安装所有所需的依赖项：

    For example, a CSV file:'
  id: totrans-90

  zh: 现在库已安装，您可以从任何PHP流中解析数据。例如，CSV文件：
- en: '[PRE3]'
  id: totrans-91
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
  zh: '[PRE3]'
- en: 'We first create a stream Observable for the file we want to read, then we apply
    some transformation: separating the input by line, parsing the CSV string in an
    array, and applying any other data processing you might want. As you can infer
    from the fact that we reassign the result to `$data` variable, the operation is
    not made in place, but a new instance is returned each time.'
  id: totrans-92
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们首先为要读取的文件创建一个流Observable，然后应用一些转换：按行分隔输入，将CSV字符串解析为数组，并应用您可能想要的任何其他数据处理。正如您可以从我们将结果重新分配给`$data`变量的事实推断出来，该操作不是就地进行的，而是每次返回一个新实例。
- en: Then, we can subscribe handlers to our stream. In our case, we simply print
    the first row of each element. Not really functional, but effective enough for
    a small example.
  id: totrans-93
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后，我们可以订阅处理程序到我们的流。在我们的例子中，我们只是打印每个元素的第一行。不是真正的功能，但对于一个小例子来说足够有效。

    your database exists. You can use it to retrieve data using a stream. You can

- en: The issue that Rx does not solve for us, however, is the application architecture
    needed to achieve referential transparency as much as possible. It does not suffice
    creating a new database query as an Observable to be pure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而，Rx 无法为我们解决的问题是实现尽可能多的引用透明度所需的应用程序架构。仅仅创建一个新的数据库查询作为 Observable 是不够纯粹的。
- en: The advice I can give you is the same you already heard in the last chapter
    that is to try to segregate all impure code in one place. In our case, this can
    be achieved by creating all streams in a unique file, like your `index.php` file,
    for example, and declaring the handlers somewhere else.
  id: totrans-105
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我可以给你的建议与上一章中听到的一样，就是尽量将所有不纯的代码隔离在一个地方。在我们的情况下，可以通过在一个唯一的文件中创建所有流来实现这一点，比如你的
    `index.php` 文件，并在其他地方声明处理程序。
- en: The various handlers can be tested in isolation and you can quickly build up
    confidence about them as they will be referentially transparent. The integration
    and functional tests will then take care of testing the streams themselves and
    the application as a whole.
  id: totrans-106
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 各种处理程序可以被孤立地测试，你可以很快对它们建立信心，因为它们将是引用透明的。集成和功能测试将负责测试流本身和整个应用程序。

    controllers and keep the handlers separated the same way as described previously.

  zh: 总结
- en: Functional reactive programming allows us to reconcile pure functions with event
    management. This means it is possible to create applications requiring inputs
    from the user or access to third-party services and external data sources. This
    is especially important as more and more websites make use of web sockets and
    other such technologies to continually push data to the users.

  zh: 函数式响应式编程使我们能够将纯函数与事件管理相协调。这意味着可以创建需要用户输入或访问第三方服务和外部数据源的应用程序。随着越来越多的网站使用 Web
    套接字和其他类似技术不断向用户推送数据，这一点尤为重要。
- en: Besides access to data sources, FRP is great when doing user interface work.
    A task is usually done with JavaScript on the Web, as PHP is mostly used to treat
    the request itself and serves an HTML response. PHP might, however, be used more
    on the desktop with initiative, such as the wrapper around **libui** available

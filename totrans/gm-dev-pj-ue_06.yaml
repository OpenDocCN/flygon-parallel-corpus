    in the previous chapter by adding further mechanics and objects to our game. Initially,
    we will follow on from the previous chapter by introducing object collision. You
    will learn how to use collision boxes, collision triggers, overlap events, hit
    events, and physics simulation. You will also learn how to use timers, the Projectile
    Movement Component, and Physical Materials.

    namely Line Traces and Sweep Traces. We learned how to execute different types
    of Line Traces, how to create our own custom Trace Channels, and how to change
    how an object responds to a specific channel. Many of the things you learned in
    the previous chapter will be used in this chapter, where we'll learn about object
    collision.

    game by adding game mechanics that revolve around object collision. We will create
    the **Dodgeball actor**, which will act as a dodgeball that bounces off of the
    floor and walls; a **Wall actor**, which will block all objects; a **Ghost Wall
    actor**, which will only block the player, not the enemies' lines of sight or
    the dodgeball; and a **Victory Box actor**, which will end the game when the player
    enters the Victory Box, representing the end of the level.

- en: Every game development tool must have a physics engine that simulates collision
    between multiple objects, as explained in the previous chapter. Collision is the
    backbone of most games released nowadays, whether 2D or 3D. In many games, it's
    the main way in which the player acts upon the environment, be it running, jumping,
    or shooting, and the environment acts accordingly by making the player land, get
    hit, and so on. It is no understatement to say that, without simulated collision,
    it wouldn't be possible to make many games at all.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The physical response from the Physics aspect (physics simulation) only applies
    when an object is simulating physics (for example, being affected by gravity,
    bouncing off the walls and ground, and so on). Such an object, when hitting a
    wall, for instance, will bounce back and continue moving in another direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, the physical response from the Query aspect applies to all
    objects that don't simulate physics. An object can move without simulating physics
    when being controlled by code (for example, by using the `SetActorLocation` function
    or by using the Character Movement Component). In this case, depending on which
    method you use to move the object and its properties, when an object hits a wall,
    it will simply stop moving instead of bouncing back. This is because you're simply
    telling the object to move in a certain direction and something is blocking its
    path, so the physics engine doesn't allow that object to continue moving.

    event doesn't happen the instant your character dies but a few seconds later.
    There is a multitude of scenarios where you want something to happen, but only
    after a certain amount of time. This will be the case for our `EnemyCharacter`,
    which will be throwing dodge balls every few seconds. This delay, or wait time,

    a new activity, but first, we'll need to make some modifications to our `DodgeballProjectile`
    class, namely adding a getter function to its `ProjectileMovementComponent`, which
    we'll be doing in the next exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A getter function is a function that only returns a specific property and does
    nothing else. These functions are usually marked as inline, which means that,
    when the code compiles, a call to that function will simply be replaced with its
    content. They are also usually marked as `const`, given that they don't modify
    any of the class's properties.

- en: With that, we conclude this quick exercise. Here, we have added a simple `getter`
    function to our `DodgeballProjectile` class, which we will be using in this chapter's
    activity, where we'll replace the `SpawnActor` function within the `EnemyCharacter`
    class with the `SpawnActorDeferred` function. This will allow us to safely edit
    our `DodgeballProjectile` class's properties before we spawn an instance of it.

    function in order to use the `SpawnActorDeferred` function instead of the `SpawnActor`
    function so that we can change the `DodgeballProjectile`'s `InitialSpeed` before
    spawning it.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because the `SpawnActorDeferred` function can't just receive a spawn location
    and rotation properties, and must instead receive an `FTransform` property, we'll
    need to create one of those before we call that function. Let's call it `SpawnTransform`
    and send the spawn rotation and location, in that order, as inputs for its constructor,
    which will be this enemy's rotation and the `SpawnLocation` property, respectively.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, update the `SpawnActor` function call into the `SpawnActorDeferred` function
    call. Instead of sending the spawn location and spawn rotation as its second and
    third parameters, replace those with the `SpawnTransform` properties we just created,
    as the second parameter.

    property called `Projectile`.

    object. However, we still need to change its `InitialSpeed` property and actually
    spawn it
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you've called the `SpawnActorDeferred` function, call the `Projectile`
    property's `GetProjectileMovementComponent` function, which returns its Projectile
    Movement Component, and change its `InitialSpeed` property to `2200` units.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because we'll be accessing properties belonging to the Projectile Movement Component
    inside the `EnemyCharacter` class, we'll need to include that component, just
    like we did in *Exercise 6.02*, *Adding a Projectile Movement Component to DodgeballProjectile*.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After you've changed the value of the `InitialSpeed` property, the only thing
    left to do is call the `Projectile` property's `FinishSpawning` function, which
    will receive the `SpawnTransform` property we created as a parameter.

    Storage spaces have been increased dramatically, RAM has suffered a substantial
    growth, and CPU's are... well... simply faster. Have they grown as much as storage
    and RAM memory? Not really, CPU industry has reached a limit in the speed that
    their CPU's can deliver, mainly because they have become so fast that they cannot
    get enough power to work while they dissipate enough heat. The CPU manufacturers
    are now shipping more cores on each computer. This situation crashes against the
    background of many systems programming languages that weren't designed for multi-processor
    CPUs or large distributed systems that act as a unique machine. In Google, they
    realized that this was becoming more than an issue while they were struggling
    to develop distributed applications in languages like Java or C++ that weren't
    designed with concurrency in mind.

    mentioned earlier in this chapter, a pointer is a like a mailbox. Imagine a bunch
    of mailboxes in a building; all of them have the same size and shape but each
    refers to a different house within the building. Just because all mailboxes are
    the same size does not mean that each house will have the same size. We could
    even have a couple of houses joined, a house that was there but now has a license
    of commerce, or a house that is completely empty. So the pointers are the mailboxes,
    all of them of the same size and that refer to a house. The building is our memory
    and the houses are the types our pointers refer to and the memory they allocate.
    If you want to receive something in your house, it's far easier to simply send
    the address of your house (to send the pointer) instead of sending the entire
    house so that your package is deposited inside. But they have some drawbacks as
    if you send your address and your house (variable it refers to) disappears after
    sending, or its type owner change--you'll be in trouble.

    have 8 GB of memory occupied by using this variable twice that, hopefully, the
    second function isn't going to use in a different function again to raise this
    number even more.

- en: The `goimport` tool is a must have in Go. Sometimes you remember your packages
    so well that you don't need to search much to remember their API but it's more
    difficult to remember the project they belong to when doing the import. The `goimport`
    command helps you by searching your `$GOPATH` for occurrences of a package that
    you could be using to provide you with the project `import` line automatically.
    This is very useful if you configure your IDE to run `goimport` on save so that
    all used packages in the source file are imported automatically if you used them.
    It also works the other way around--if you delete the function you were using
    from a package and the package isn't being used anymore, it will remove the `import`
    line.

    have a proper folder structure within the GOPATH. This introduces a small problem
    when working with GitHub projects. We are used to forking a project, cloning our
    fork and start working before committing the pull-request to the original project.
    Wrong!

- en: After this first chapter, you must be familiar with the syntax of Go and some
    of the command-line tools that come bundled with the compiler. We have left apart
    concurrency capabilities for a later chapter as they are large and pretty complex
    to grasp at the beginning so that the reader learns the syntax of the language
    first, becomes familiar and confident with it, and then they can jump to understanding **Communicating
    Sequential Processes** (**CSP**) concurrency patterns and distributed applications.
    The next steps are to start with the creational design patterns.

    Creational patterns. As the name implies, it groups common practices for creating
    objects, so object creation is more encapsulated from the users that need those
    objects. Mainly, creational patterns try to give ready-to-use objects to users
    instead of asking for their creation, which, in some cases, could be complex,
    or which would couple your code with the concrete implementations of the functionality
    that should be defined in an interface.

    when you ask them about design patterns, more than 80% will mention **Singleton**
    design pattern. Why is that? Maybe it's because it is one of the most used design

    creational design patterns because of the latter reason.

    a **Builder** design pattern. The Builder pattern helps us construct complex objects
    without directly instantiating their struct, or writing the logic they require.
    Imagine an object that could have dozens of fields that are more complex structs
    themselves. Now imagine that you have many objects with these characteristics,

    such as retrieving some value, maybe from a web service or a database. The user
    only needs an interface that provides him this value. By delegating this decision
    to a Factory, this Factory can provide an interface that fits the user needs.

    is a common method to retrieve methods of payment. We use the constant `Cash`,
    which we have defined in the implementation file (if we were using this constant
    outside for the scope of the package, we would call it using the name of the package
    as the prefix, so the syntax would be `creational.Cash`). We also check that we
    have not received an error when asking for a payment method. Observe that if we
    receive the error when asking for a payment method, we call `t.Fatal` to stop
    the execution of the tests; if we called just `t.Error` like in the previous tests,
    we would have a problem in the next lines when trying to access the `Pay` method
    of a nil object, and our tests would crash execution. We continue by using the
    `Pay` method of the interface by passing 10.30 as the amount. The returned message
    will have to contain the text `paid using cash`. The `t.Log(string)` method is
    a special method in testing. This struct allows us to write some logs when we
    run the tests if we pass the `-v` flag.

    The idea behind grouping objects in families and grouping families is to have
    big factories that can be interchangeable and can grow more easily. In the early
    stages of development, it is also easier to work with factories and abstract factories
    than to wait until all concrete implementations are done to start your code. Also,
    you won't write an Abstract Factory from the beginning unless you know that your
    object's inventory for a particular field is going to be very large and it could
    be easily grouped into families.

    mix the creation of cars with motorbikes, providing more flexibility in the creation

    probably be different.

    You have probably realized too that some patterns can overlap a bit, but they
    have small differences that make them more appropriate in some cases and not so
    much in others.

- en: We have seen the five main creational design patterns commonly used in the software
    industry. Their purpose is to abstract the user from the creation of objects for
    complexity or maintainability purposes. They have been the foundation of thousands
    of applications and libraries since the 1990s, and most of the software we use
    today has many of these creational patterns under the hood.

    chapter, we will see concurrent programming in Go, and how to create some of the
    more critical design patterns using a concurrent approach.

    Structural patterns, as the name implies, help us to shape our applications with
    commonly used structures and relationships.

- en: The Go language, by nature, encourages use of composition almost exclusively
    by its lack of inheritance. Because of this, we have been using the **Composite**
    design pattern extensively until now, so let's start by defining the Composite
    design pattern.

- en: The Composite design pattern favors composition (commonly defined as a *has
    a* relationship) over inheritance (an *is a* relationship). The c*omposition over
    inheritance* approach has been a source of discussions among engineers since the
    nineties. We will learn how to create object structures by using a *has a* approach.
    All in all, Go doesn't have inheritance because it doesn't need it!

    Objects have different objects with their own fields and methods inside them.
    This approach is very powerful and solves many problems of inheritance and multiple
    inheritances. For example, a typical inheritance problem is when you have an entity
    that inherits from two completely different classes, which have absolutely no
    relationship between them. Imagine an athlete who trains, and who is a swimmer who
    swims:'

    method and declares its own `Swim` method. You could also have a cyclist who is

    So, how do you solve it? A fish cannot be a swimmer that also trains. Fish don't
    train (as far as I know!). You could make a `Swimmer` interface with a `Swim`
    method, and make the swimmer athlete and fish implement it. This would be the
    best approach, but you still would have to implement `swim` method twice, so code
    reusability would be affected. What about a triathlete? They are athletes who
    swim, run, and ride. With multiple inheritances, you could have a sort of solution,
    but that will become complex and not maintainable very soon.

    working with interfaces  which are preferred instead of structs. Second, you aren't
    leaving parts of your code to the zero-initialization feature of the compiler.
    It's a really powerful feature, but one that must be used with care, because it
    can lead to runtime problems which you'll find at compile time when working with
    interfaces. In different situations, zero-initialization will save you at runtime,
    in fact! But I prefer to work with interfaces as much as possible, so this is
    not actually one of the options.

    It's a very idiomatic Go feature, and the switch from a pure object-oriented language

    interface to deal with the current needs of your application, which, under the
    hood, uses implementations of the old interface.

    On one hand, we should try to write code that is extensible and not only one that
    works. At the same time, we should try not to modify the source code (yours or
    other people's) as much as we can, because we aren't always aware of the implications
    of this modification. Just keep in mind that extensibility in code is only possible

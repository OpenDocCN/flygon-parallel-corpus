    to the Strategy pattern but that provides greater flexibility. Memento design
    pattern is used in 99% of applications we use every day to achieve undo functions

    useful, especially when writing libraries and frameworks. The idea is to provide
    a user some way to execute code within an algorithm.

    see some Go source code where it's wisely used. We will write an algorithm of
    three steps where the second step is delegated to the user while the first and
    third aren't. The first and third steps on the algorithm represent the template.

    in different strategies, with the Template pattern we will try to achieve something
    similar but with just part of the algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Template design pattern lets the user write a part of an algorithm while
    the rest is executed by the abstraction. This is common when creating libraries
    to ease in some complex task or when reusability of some algorithm is compromised
    by only a part of it.

    be abstracted in the same algorithm that receives an interface with whatever the
    fifth step needs to finish the transaction. It doesn't need to be a interface
    either, it could be a callback.

    a value, it pushes it into the stack.

- en: When the symbol is an operator, we also take the right and left values from
    the stack, we call the Factory pattern using the current operator and the left
    and right values that we just took from the stack. Once we have the operator type,
    we just need to call its `Read` method to push the returned value to the stack
    too.

- en: This pattern is extremely powerful but it must also be used carefully. To create
    a language, it generates a strong coupling between its users and the functionality
    it provides. One can fall into the error of trying to create a too flexible language
    that is incredibly complex to use and maintain. Also, one can create a fairly
    small and useful language that doesn't interpret correctly sometimes and it could
    be a pain for its users.

- en: In our example, we have omitted quite a lot of error-checking to focus on the
    implementation of the Interpreter. However, you'll need quite a lot of error checking
    and verbose output on errors to help the user correct its syntax errors. So, have
    fun writing your language but be nice to your users.

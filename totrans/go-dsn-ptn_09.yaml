    - Composite, Adapter, and Bridge Design Patterns"), *Structural Patterns - Adapter,
    Bridge, and Composite Design Patterns*, when we talked about the Adapter design
    pattern. To recall, a pipe allows us to connect an `io.Writer` interface to an
    `io.Reader` interface so that the reader input is the `Writer` output. We define
    the `os.Stdout` as the writer. Then, to capture `stdout` output, we will need
    a different Goroutine that listens while we write to the console. As you know,
    if we write, we don't capture, and if we capture, we are not writing. The keyword
    here is `while`; it is a good rule of thumb that if you find this word in some
    definition, you'll probably need a concurrent structure. So we use the `go` keyword
    to launch a different Goroutine that copies reader input to a bytes buffer before
    sending the contents of the buffer through a channel (that we should have previously
    created).
  prefs: []

    yet, so we call our (not yet written) function `barrier` with the provided endpoints.
    Next, we have to close the writer to signal the Goroutine that no more input is
    going to come to it. Our channel called out blocks execution until some value
    is received (the one sent by our launched Goroutine). The last step is to return
    the contents captured from the console.

    it to a byte slice, and send it through the `out` channel.
  prefs: []

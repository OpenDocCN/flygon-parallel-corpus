    and using Go packages, Go data structures, algorithms, and GC. However, until
    now, we have not developed any actual system utility. This will change very soon
    because starting from this really important chapter, we will begin developing
    real system utilities in Go by learning how to use Go, to work with the various
    types of files and directories of a filesystem.

    symbolic links, directories, network devices, network sockets, entire hard drives,
    printers, and plain text files. The purpose of this chapter is to illustrate how
    the Go standard library allows us to understand if a path exists or not, as well
    as how to search directory structures to detect the kind of files we want. Additionally,
    this chapter will prove, using Go code as evidence, that many traditional Unix
    command-line utilities that work with files and directories do not have a difficult
    implementation.

    them, put them into the wastebasket, change their names, visit them, and decide
    which ones you want to use, whereas the `io` package, which will be presented

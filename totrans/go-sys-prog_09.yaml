    and **channels** in order to program concurrent applications in its own way while
    providing support for traditional concurrency techniques. Everything in Go is
    executed using goroutines; when a program starts its execution, its single goroutine
    automatically calls the  `main()` function in order to begin the actual execution
    of the program.

- en: A **goroutine** is the minimum Go entity that can be executed concurrently.
    Note that the use of the word *minimum* is very important here because goroutines
    are not autonomous entities. Goroutines live in threads that live in Unix processes.
    Putting it simply, processes can be autonomous and exist on their own, whereas
    both goroutines and threads cannot. So, in order to create a goroutine, you will
    need to have a process with at least one thread. The good thing is that goroutines
    are lighter than threads, which are lighter than processes. Everything in Go is
    executed using goroutines, which makes perfect sense since Go is a concurrent
    programming language by design. As you have just learned, when a Go program starts
    its execution, its single goroutine calls the `main()` function, which starts
    the actual program execution.
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can define a new goroutine using the `go` keyword followed by a function
    name or the full definition of an anonymous function. The `go` keyword starts
    the function argument to it in a new goroutine and allows the invoking function
    to continue on by itself.
  id: totrans-14

    order your goroutines are going to get executed because this depends on the scheduler

- en: A very common misconception is that **concurrency** and **parallelism** refer
    to the same thing, which is far from true! Parallelism is the simultaneous execution
    of multiple things, whereas concurrency is a way of structuring your components
    so that they can be independently executed when possible.
  id: totrans-17

    when and if your operating system and your hardware permit it. The Erlang programming
    language did this a long time ago, long before CPUs had multiple cores and computers
    had lots of RAM.'
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a valid concurrent design, adding concurrent entities makes the whole system
    run faster because more things can run in parallel. So, the desired parallelism
    comes from a better concurrent expression and implementation of the problem. The
    developer is responsible for taking concurrency into account during the design
    phase of a system and benefit from a potential parallel execution of the components
    of the system. So, the developer should not think about parallelism, but about
    breaking things into independent components that solve the initial problem when
    combined.

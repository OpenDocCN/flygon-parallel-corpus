- en: '**CI/CD** (short for **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery**) often
    requires ephemeral build and test servers to be available whenever changes are
    pushed to the code repository. Docker and Kubernetes are well suited for this
    task as it''s easy to create containers in a few seconds and just as easy to remove
    them after builds are run. In addition, if you already have a large portion of
    infrastructure available on your cluster, it can make sense to utilize the idle
    capacity for builds and testing.'

    software. Gulp.js is a simple task runner used to automate the build process using

    server.

    from GitHub. The pull tasks execute a `git` pull on the cloned repository. Next,
    the `docker-build` command builds an image from the `container-info` subfolder
    and pushes it to DockerHub. Finally, we have the `create-kube-pod` and `update-kube-pod`
    command. As you can guess, the `create-kube-pod` command creates our controller
    and service for the first time, whereas the `update-kube-pod` command simply replaces
    the controller.

    that the host starts with `node-gulp`, just as we named it in the previously mentioned
    pod definition.

    computer with a fruit-based name (such as Apple, BlackBerry, and Apricot) and
    a nod to the original concept of a simple computer that could be programmed using
    **Python** (shortened to **Pi**).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is often asked, "Why has Python been selected as the language to use on Raspberry
    Pi?" The fact is that Python is just one of the many programming languages that
    can be used on Raspberry Pi.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many programming languages that you can choose, from high-level graphical
    block programming, such as **Scratch**, to traditional **C**, right down to **BASIC**,
    and even the raw **machine code assembler**. A good programmer often has to be
    code multilingual to be able to play to the strengths and weaknesses of each language
    to best meet the needs of their desired application. It is useful to understand
    how different languages (and programming techniques) try to overcome the challenge
    of converting *what you want* into *what you get*, as this is what you are trying
    to do as well while you program.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python has been selected as a good place to start when learning about programming,
    as it provides a rich set of coding tools while still allowing simple programs
    to be written without fuss. This allows beginners to gradually be introduced to
    the concepts and methods on which modern programming languages are based without
    requiring them to know it all from the start. It is very modular with lots of
    additional libraries that can be imported to quickly extend the functionality.
    You will find that, over time, this encourages you to do the same, and you will
    want to create your own modules that you can plug into your own programs, thus
    taking your first steps into structured programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python addresses formatting and presentation concerns. As indentation will add
    better readability, indents matter a lot in Python. They define how blocks of
    code are grouped together. Generally, Python is slow; since it is interpreted,
    it takes time to create a module while it is running the program. This can be
    a problem if you need to respond to time-critical events. However, you can precompile
    Python or use modules written in other languages to overcome this.

    for beginners but can be difficult when you have to second-guess aspects such
    as datatypes. However, this in turn forces you to consider all the possibilities,
    which can be a good thing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A massive source of confusion for beginners is that there are two versions of
    Python on Raspberry Pi (**Version 2.7** and **Version 3.6**), which are not compatible
    with each other, so code written for Python 2.7 may not run with Python 3.6 (and
    vice versa).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Python Software Foundation** is continuously working to improve and move
    forward with the language, which sometimes means they have to sacrifice backward
    compatibility to embrace new improvements (and, importantly, remove redundant
    and legacy ways of doing things).

- en: There are many tools that will ease the transition from Python 2 to Python 3,
    including converters such as `2to3`, which will parse and update your code to
    use Python 3 methods. This process is not perfect, and in some cases you'll need
    to manually rewrite sections and fully retest everything. You can write the code
    and libraries that will support both. The `import __future__` statement allows
    you to import the friendly methods of Python 3 and run them using Python 2.7.

- en: Which version of Python should you use?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to do. For instance, you may require Python 2.7 libraries, which are not yet available
    for Python 3.6\. Python 3 has been available since 2008, so these tend to be older
    or larger libraries that have not been translated. In many cases, there are new
    alternatives to legacy libraries; however, their support can vary.

    small and large updates and improvements to the original Raspberry Pi Model B
    unit. Although it can be confusing at first, there are three basic types of Raspberry
    Pi available (and one special model).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main flagship model is called **Model B**. This has all the connections
    and features, as well as the maximum RAM and the latest processor. Over the years,
    there have been several versions, most notably Model B (which had 256 MB and then
    512 MB RAM) and then Model B+ (which increased the 26-pin GPIO to 40 pins, switched
    to using a microSD card slot, and had four USB ports instead of two). These original
    models all used the Broadcom BCM2835 **system on chip** (**SOC**), consisting
    of a single core 700 MHz ARM11 and VideoCore IV **graphical processing unit**
    (**GPU**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The release of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (also referred to as 2B) in 2015 introduced
    a new Broadcom BCM2836 SOC, providing a quad-core 32-bit ARM Cortex A7 1.2 GHz
    processor and GPU, with 1 GB of RAM. The improved SOC added support for Ubuntu
    and Windows 10 IoT. Finally, we had the latest Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, using another
    new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC, which provides a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 and
    GPU, alongside on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Model A** has always been targeted as a cut-down version. While having the
    same SOC as Model B, there are limited connections consisting of a single USB
    port and no wired network (LAN). Model A+ again added more GPIO pins and a microSD
    slot. However, the RAM was later upgraded to 512 MB of RAM and again there was
    only a single USB port/no LAN. The Broadcom BCM2835 SOC on Model A has not been
    updated so far (so is still a single core ARM11); however, a Model 3A (most likely
    using the BCM2837).'

    applications where cost and space are a premium. It has the same 40-pin GPIO and
    microSD card slot as the other models, but lacks the on-board display (CSI and
    DSI) connection. It does still have HDMI (via a mini-HDMI) and a single micro
    USB **on-the-go** (**OTG**) connection. Although not present in the first revision
    of the Pi Zero, the most recent model also includes a CSI connection for the on-board
    camera.
  prefs: []

    magazine *The MagPi*, giving the magazine the benefit of being the first magazine
    to give away a computer on its cover! This did make me rather proud since (as
    you may have read in my biography at the start of this book) I was one of the
    founders of the magazine.

    a 200-pin SODIMM card. It is intended for industrial use or within commercial
    products, where all the external interfaces would be provided by a host/motherboard,
    into which the module would be inserted. Example products include the Slice Media
    Player ([http://fiveninjas.com](http://fiveninjas.com)) and the OTTO camera. The
    current module uses the BCM2835, although an updated compute module (CM3).

    are correctly registered. If you have macOS X, you will have Bonjour running already.

    Then you can use the hostname, `raspberrypi` or `raspberrypi.local`, to connect
    to Raspberry Pi over the network. If you need to change the hostname, then you
    can do so with the Raspberry Pi configuration tool, shown previously.

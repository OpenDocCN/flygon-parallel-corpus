- en: Until now, we have focused purely on command-line applications; however, there
    is much more to Raspberry Pi than just the command line. By using **graphical
    user interfaces** (**GUIs**), it is often easier to obtain input from a user and
    provide feedback in a simpler way. After all, we continuously process multiple
    inputs and outputs all the time, so why limit ourselves to the procedural format
    of the command line when we don't have to?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, Python can support this. Much like other programming languages,
    such as Visual Basic and C/C++/C#, this can be achieved using prebuilt objects
    that provide standard controls. We will use a module called **Tkinter** which
    provides a good range of controls (also referred to as **widgets**) and tools
    for creating graphical applications.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: All controls must be linked to the application window; hence, we have to specify
    our Tkinter window `root`. The text used for the label is set by `text`; in this
    case, we have set it to a string named `prompt`, which has been defined previously
    with the text we require. We also set the `width` to match the number of characters
    of the message (while not essential, it provides a neater result if we add more
    text to our labels later), and finally, we set the background color using `bg='green'`.

    of the box which is a special string variable. We could access the `text` directly
    using `textEnter.get()`, but we shall use a `Tkinter StringVar()` object instead
    to access it indirectly. If required, this will allow us to separate the data
    we are processing from the code that handles the GUI layout. The `enycrptvalue`
    variable automatically updates the `Entry` widget it is linked to whenever the
    `.set()` command is used (and the `.get()` command obtains the latest value from
    the `Entry` widget).

    have the `encryptButton()` function, which will set the `encryptvalue StringVar`
    that controls the contents of the first `Entry` box. This string is set to the
    result we get by calling `ENC.encryptText()` with the message we want to encrypt
    (the current value of `encryptvalue`) and the `keyvalue` variable. The `decrypt()`
    function is exactly the same, except we make the `keyvalue` variable negative
    to decrypt the message:'

    `textvariable` can also be an integer (numerical value) if required, but there
    is no built-in check to ensure that only numbers can be entered. You will encounter
    a `ValueError` exception when the `.get()` command is used.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The place layout allows us to specify the positions and sizes using exact pixel
    positions. The pack layout places the items in the window in the order that they
    have been added in. The grid layout allows us to place the items in a specific
    layout. It is recommended that you avoid the place layout wherever possible since
    any small change to one item can have a knock-on effect on the positions and sizes
    of all the other items; the other layouts account for this by determining their
    positions relative to the other items in the window.

- en: We can specify that the first `Label` and `Entry` box will span both columns
    (`columnspan=2`), and we can set the sticky values to ensure they span right to
    the edges. This is achieved by setting both the `TK.E` for the east and `TK.W`
    for the west sides. We'd use `TK.N` for the north and `TK.S` for the south sides
    if we needed to do the same vertically. If the `column` value is not specified,
    the grid function defaults to `column=0`. The other items are similarly defined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We create the Tkinter window as we did before; however, instead of defining
    all the items separately, we create a special class for the application buttons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The class we create acts as a blueprint or specification of what we want the
    `appButtons` items to include. Each item will consist of a string value for `app_cmd`,
    a function called `startApp()`, and an `__init__()` function. The `__init__()`
    function is a special function (called a **constructor**) that is called when
    we create an `appButtons` item; it will allow us to create any setup that is required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, the `__init__()` function allows us to create a new Tkinter button
    with the text to be set to an item in `app_list` and the command to be called
    in the `startApp()` function when the button is clicked. The `self` keyword is
    used so that the command called will be the one that is part of the item; this
    means that each button will call a locally defined function that has access to
    the local data of the item.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We set the value of `self.app_cmd` to the command from `app_list` and make it
    ready for use via the `startApp()` function. We now create the `startApp()` function.
    If we run the application command here directly, the Tkinter window will freeze
    until the application we have opened is closed again. To avoid this, we can use
    the Python threading module, which allows us to perform multiple actions at the
    same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `runApplicationThread()` class is created using the `threading.Thread` class
    as a template—this inherits all the features of the `threading.Thread` class in
    a new class. Just like our previous class, we provide an `__init__()` function
    for this as well. We first call the `__init__()` function of the inherited class
    to ensure it is set up correctly, and then we store the `app_cmd` value in `self.cmd`.
    After the `runApplicationThread()` function has been created and initialized,
    the `start()` function is called. This function is part of `threading.Thread`,
    which our class can use. When the `start()` function is called, it will create
    a separate application thread (that is, simulate running two things at the same
    time), allowing Tkinter to continue monitoring button clicks while executing the
    `run()` function within the class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we can place the code in the `run()` function to run the required
    application (using `call(self.cmd)`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's more...
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One aspect that makes Python particularly powerful is that it supports the programming
    techniques used in **Object-Orientated Design** (**OOD**). This is commonly used
    by modern programming languages to help translate the tasks we want our program
    to perform into meaningful constructs and structures in code. The principle of
    OOD lies in the fact that we think of most problems as consisting of several objects
    (a GUI window, a button, and so on) that interact with each other to produce a
    desired result.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous section, we found that we could use classes to create unique
    objects that could be reused multiple times. We created an `appButton` class,
    which generated an object with all the features of the class, including its own
    personal version of `app_cmd` that will be used by the `startApp()` function.
    Another object of the `appButton` type will have its own unrelated `[app_cmd]`
    data that its `startApp()` function will use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that classes are useful to keep together a collection of related
    variables and functions in a single object, and the class will hold its own data
    in one place. Having multiple objects of the same type (class), each with their
    own functions and data inside them, results in better program structure. The traditional
    approach would be to keep all the information in one place and send each item
    back and forth for various functions to process; however, this may become cumbersome
    in large systems.

- en: So far, we have used Python modules to separate parts of our programs into different
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: files; this allows us to conceptually separate different parts of the program
    (an interface, encoder/decoder, or library of classes, such as Tkinter). Modules
    can provide code to control a particular bit of hardware, define an interface
    for the internet, or provide a library of common functionality; however, its most
    important function is to control the interface (the collection of functions, variables,
    and classes that are available when the item is imported). A well-implemented
    module should have a clear interface that is centered around how it is used, rather
    than how it is implemented. This allows you to create multiple modules that can
    be swapped and changed easily since they share the same interface. In our previous
    example, imagine how easy it would be to change the `encryptdecrypt` module for
    another one just by supporting `encryptText(input_text,key)`. Complex functionality
    can be split into smaller, manageable blocks that can be reused in multiple applications.
  prefs: []

- en: Python makes use of classes and modules all the time. Each time you import a
    library, such as `sys` or Tkinter or convert a value using `value.str()` and iterate
    through a list using `for...in`, you can use them without worrying about the details.
    You don't have to use classes or modules in every bit of code you write, but they
    are useful tools to keep in your programmer's toolbox for times when they fit
    what you are doing.

    in the standard date format. We create a `self.filedates` dictionary that we populate
    with three dates extracted from the EXIF information. We then add the filesystem
    dates (created and modified) just in case no EXIF data is available. The `os`
    module allows us to use `os.path.getctime()` and `os.path.getmtime()` to obtain
    an epoch value of the file creation. It can also be the date and time when the
    file was moved – and the file modification – when it was last written to (for

    is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, but we can use `datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp()`

    and pick out a suitable date. However, this would require the programmer to know
    how the `self.dates` values are arranged, and if we later changed how they are
    stored, it would break their program. For this reason, it is recommended that
    we access data in a class through access functions so the implementation is independent
    of the interfaces (this process is known as **encapsulation**). We provide a function
    that returns a date when called; the programmer does not need to know that it
    could be one of the five available dates or even that they are stored as epoch
    values. Using a function, we can ensure that the interface will remain the same
    no matter how the data is stored or collected.

- en: Finally, the last function we want the `Photo` class to provide is `previewPhoto()`.
    This function provides a method to generate a small thumbnail image and saves
    it as a **Portable Pixmap Format** (**PPM**) file. As we will discover in a moment,
    Tkinter allows us to place images on its `Canvas` widget, but unfortunately, it
    does not support JPEGs directly and only supports GIF or PPM. Therefore, we simply
    save a small copy of the image we want to display in the PPM format – with the
    added warning that the image pallet must be converted to RGB too – and then get
    Tkinter to load it onto the `Canvas` when required.

    we convert it to a tuple type before setting the value. The `Listbox` widget gets
    added; we need to make sure that the `listvariable` parameter is set to `photoInfo`
    and also set the font to `monospace`. This will allow us to line up our data values
    using spaces, as `monospace` is a fixed width font, so each character takes up

    using `.ljust(25)`—it adds left justification to the name and pads it out to make
    the string 25 characters wide. Once we have the list, we convert it to a tuple

    and variables in Python. We will also discuss strings and accepting user inputs
    in Python. You will learn about the Raspberry Pi's GPIO and its features and write
    code in Python that makes an LED blink using the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO. We

    especially helpful while parsing information from certain sensors. For example,
    Some sensors share their output at a certain frequency. When a new data point
    is available, a certain bit is set indicating that the data is available. Bitwise
    operators can be used to check whether a particular bit is set before retrieving
    the datapoint from the sensor.

    location on the computer's memory and enables writing user-readable code.

    an office or a university. The person would be asked to fill out an application
    form with relevant information, including their name, department, and emergency
    contact information. The form would have the requisite fields. This would enable
    the office manager to refer to the form while creating a new ID card.

    in the computer's memory. It would be very difficult to write code if one had
    to write code keeping the storage memory map in mind. For example, it is easier
    to use the variable called name rather than a specific memory address like `0x3745092`.

    in the circle correspond to the pin numbers on the Raspberry Pi's processor. For
    example, GPIO pin **2** (second pin from the left on the bottom row) corresponds
    to the GPIO pin **2** on the Raspberry Pi's processor and not the physical pin
    location on the GPIO header.

    Keep a GPIO pin handout (available for download along with this chapter) for your
    reference. It takes some time to get used to the GPIO pin mapping of the Raspberry
    Pi Zero.

- en: The Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant, that is, if a voltage greater
    than 3.3V is applied to the pin, it may permanently damage the pin. When set to
    *high*, the pins are set to 3.3V and 0V when the pins are set to low.

    You will learn about conditional statements and how to make use of logical operators
    to check conditions using conditional statements. Next, you will learn to write
    simple functions in Python and discuss interfacing inputs to the Raspberry Pi's
    GPIO header using a tactile switch (momentary push button). We will also discuss
    motor control (this is a run-up to the final project) using the Raspberry Pi Zero
    and control the motors using the switch inputs. Let's get to it!

    required to interface a button to the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO interface. These
    attributes include button states and functions required to check the button states
    and so on. In order to interface a button and read its states, we need to make

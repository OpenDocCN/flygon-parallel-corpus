    (**OOP**) in Python. We will discuss data types including lists, dictionaries,
    tuples and sets in Python. We will also discuss OOP, it's necessity and how to
    write object-oriented code in Python for Raspberry Pi based projects (such as,
    using OOP to control appliances at home). We will discuss making use of OOP in
    a Raspberry Pi Zero project.

    sensors that are equipped with a UART port could be grouped together using object-oriented
    code.

    an application without paying attention to the nitty-gritty detail behind the
    sensor's interface. OOP provides modularity to an application that simplifies
    application development. We are going to review an example in this chapter that

    while creating an instance of the `Student` class, the attributes `name`, `age`,
    and `address` are required arguments.

    to the `Student` class by passing the requisite arguments (declared earlier in
    the `__init__()` method of the `Student` class), the `__init__()` method is automatically
    called to initialize the object. Upon initialization, the information related

    `student1_age`, `student1_address`, `student2_name`, `student2_age` and `student2_address`

    about a class or a method. Doc strings are especially helpful while trying to
    store information related to the usage of a method or a class (this will be demonstrated
    later in this chapter). Doc strings are also used at the beginning of a file to
    store multi-line comments related to an application or a code sample. Doc strings
    are ignored by the Python interpreter and they are meant to provide documentation
    about a class to fellow programmers.

    with a `#` sign. Single line comments are generally used to make a specific note
    on a block of code. The practice of including well-structured comments makes your
    code readable.

    us. We may recall the cartoon serial *The Jetsons* or think of the movie *Terminator*.
    But, as a matter of fact, robots as a species do not belong to science fiction
    anymore. They are as real as they can get. Look around you and point out any object;
    it probably wouldn't have been made without a robot. The modern era has been shaped

    has been adapted over the years. After you feed in the type of cloth it automatically
    washes, rinses, and dries as you would have done yourself in the 19th century.
    The point I am trying to make is that there is a huge variation of robots that
    we can think of, which can radically change the way we live. We need to think
    with a wider perspective—not just limit robot to look as a human adaption in form
    of humanoid robots.

    word microprocessor. This is the primary unit that has to make all the decisions.
    I call it the *king*, but what is a king without an empire? For the king to work,
    he needs some subordinates that can do the things for him, the same way in which
    the microprocessor needs a few subordinates such as RAM, storage, I/O devices,
    and so on. Now, the problem is that when we put in all these things the overall
    unit gets expensive and bulky. But, as we know, subsequently weight and size are
    very important factors when it comes to robots, so we cannot afford to have a
    big bulky piece of system running a robot.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, we made something called a SoC. Now, this is a one man show as this small
    chip, has all the necessary systems for it to work inside that small little chipset
    itself. So, now you don't need to add RAM or storage or any other thing for it
    to work. These small microcontrollers can get really powerful but a downside is,
    once a manufacturer has made an SoC, thereafter no changes can be done to it.
    The size of storage, RAM, or the I/O cannot be changed. But we generally can live
    with these limitations as when programming the robots, you might not be using
    the entire juice of the microcontroller until the time you are running some serious
    artificial intelligence or machine-learning code.

    fact that it is used by roboticists everywhere to bring out their ideas and to
    make them a reality in a quick time span. It is available all across the globe
    and is extremely cheap. You can literally stream HD movies, surf the internet,

    over which you can hook up your HD monitor or a TV screen. Second there is a micro
    SD card slot. This will be the primary storage device for this computer. Other
    than that, you will also find two USB sockets and a camera bus. You may think
    this is it, but the best is yet to come. Raspberry Pi has something called **GPIO**,
    which stands for **general purpose input/output**. These are disguised as small
    40 through-hole ports on one corner of the Raspberry Pi; this is what makes it
    super special.

    a USB port, but what if you need to connect your computer to your light bulbs

    the day. These are pins which are very useful when it comes to robotics, as these
    can be used to connect various components such as sensors/motors. The beauty of
    these pins is that they can be used as either input or output based on what we
    program them for. So, as we will later see, each of these pins can be defined
    in the program to be either input or output based on our needs.

    the preceding line. Now, before we understand what it does, we need to understand

    and again in multiple places. This takes a lot of time and certainly is not cool!

    code again; rather, we simply have to call the function to do it for us instead
    of writing the code to multiply. The problem is, how do we tell which number has
    to be multiplied?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is called we put opening and closing brackets after it, such as `multiply()`.
  prefs: []

    we have to multiply `2` and `3` we simply write `Multiply(2,3)`.

    simpler for the programmers. Others can be defined as open source or developed
    by you at your convenience.

    is a library defined by Raspberry Pi. This will have functions that will make
    your life easier when it comes to programming Raspberry Pi. So, in the program,
    once we call the library, all the functions are at your disposal and ready to
    be used.

    pins are hard numbered according to their physical positions in Raspberry Pi.
    However, we can change the numbering of the pins in the software for our understanding
    and convenience. But in this code, we will not be playing around with this and
    will set it do the default set by Broadcom, which is the manufacturer of the microcontroller

    program itself. It cannot do both functions at the same time. Here is how it is

    does is that it sets up a specific pin of the board in a state which we want.
    So, here we have mentioned that the pin number `23` has to be set high. Just for
    the sake of clarity, high means on and low means off.

    basically freezes the state of all the GPIO pins. So, for example, if the pin
    `23` is high then it will remain high until the `time` the function `sleep` is
    executed. In the function `sleep`, we have defined the value as `3` seconds.

    will reset the state of every pin that has been used in the program—the state
    of all the pins will be low. Remember, it will only affect the pins that are used
    in the program and not any other pins. So, for example, we have used the pin `23`
    in the program, so it will only affect pin `23` and not any other pin in Raspberry
    Pi.

    be executed one line after the other. So, let's say we keep `import RPI.GPIO as
    GPIO` at the bottom, then the whole program will not work. Why? Because as soon
    as it goes to `GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)` it will not understand what `GPIO` is,
    neither will it understand what `setmode` is. Hence, we always import the libraries
    as soon as we start writing the code.

    code progresses, it will glow the LED high for 0.5 seconds and then shut it off
    for 0.5 seconds. And then it will wait for 1 second. This will repeat until the
    while loop is false, as in the value of `i` becomes greater than `3` where it
    would get out of the program and terminate. Run the program and see if it actually
    happens.

    as a switch—simply switching the various components on and off. But what if we
    need to vary the intensity of the LEDs that we have just programmed? Is it possible? The
    answer is no. But we can still get it done somehow!

- en: Let's see how. Computers work in binary which means that they can represent
    either `0` or `1`. This is because of the fact that the primary computing unit
    in any system is based on a transistor which can either be on or off representing
    `0` or `1`. So, if we see this technically, computers are only capable of switching
    due to the binary architecture. However, there is a trick. This trick is called
    **pulse width modulation** (**PWM**).

    it a bit and change the `PWM(18,1)` to `PWM(18,5)`. Let's run and see what happens.
  prefs: []

- en: You will have noticed that it is now blinking five times in a second. So the
    number `5` is basically representing the frequency as the LED is now flickering
    five times in a second. Now, again, rewrite the code and increase `5` to `50`.
    Once you increase it to `50`, it switches the LED on and off 50 times in a second
    or at 50 Hertz. So, it appears to you as if it is always on.

    pulse, the characteristics of which we are changing. The first characteristic
    is the frequency, the pulses generated in a second. In the code line `pwm= GPIO.PWM(18,1)` ,
    we are basically telling the microcontroller to generate one pulse every second
    on pin number `1`. In the second line, duty cycle is a percent value. It determines
    for how much percent of the time the pulse will be high. For the rest of the time
    of the pulse the output of the pin will be off. So, for the following code, the
    below bulleted points would be the characteristics:'

- en: When we increase the frequency more than 50 hertz then it is very hard for the
    human eye to make out if it is actually switching on or off. Theoretically, for
    50% of the time the pin will remain high, and for the rest of the time it will
    be low. So, if we take an average then we can easily say that the overall voltage
    would be half of the original. Using this method, we can modulate the voltage
    output of any pin as per our requirements.

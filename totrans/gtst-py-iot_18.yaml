    gets dark red in color, and when we heat it further, it gets brighter and slowly
    goes from red to yellow as depicted in the below diagram which shows a red hot
    steel tab. Now, as the temperature increases, the wavelength of the emitted radiation
    decreases; that is why with the increase in temperature the color changes from
    red to yellow, as yellow has a shorter wavelength compared to red.

    they emit radiation; in fact, any object that is above the temperate of absolute
    zero emits some form of radiation. Some we can see with the naked eye, others
    we can't. So, at room temperature, objects emit infrared radiation which has a
    higher wavelength compared to visible light. Hence, we don't see it with our eyes.
    Nonetheless, it is still there.
  prefs: []

    around it and whenever an object moves, it can sense the overall change in its

    in its proximity.

    sensor detects movement, it turns its output pin to high. All we have to do is
    to monitor that pin and that's basically it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the basics. A proximity sensor is a type of sensor that senses the proximity
    of an object from it. There is a universe full of sensors that are available to
    accomplish this task and numerous technologies that allow us to do so. As the
    name says, the ultrasonic proximity sensor works on the principal of ultrasonic
    sound waves. The working principle is quite easy to understand. The ultrasonic
    sensor sends a beam of ultrasonic sound waves; these waves are inaudible to human
    ears, but nonetheless it is still a sound wave and it also behaves like a sound
    wave.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, as we know, sound bounces off different surfaces and forms an echo. You
    must have experienced this echo when speaking in an empty room. You can hear your
    own sound but with a slight delay. This delay is caused by the property of sound.
    A sound is a wave, hence it has a speed. Sound waves have a set speed of travel.
    So, to cover a specific distance, they take some time. By calculating this time,
    we can derive how far the sound waves are going before getting bounced off from
    a surface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, in this sensor, we shoot ultrasonic sound waves in a specific direction
    and then sense the echo which bounces back. Naturally, there would be a delay
    in receiving the echo; the delay would be directly proportional to the distance
    of the object from the sensor and, based on this delay, we could easily compute
    the distance.

    architecture of the sensor to wire it correctly. There are four pins in the sensor,

    sensors, but we are limited by the number of GPIOs that are present. We have also

    for their working. This further reduces the number of sensors that we can interface

    Now let's go ahead and see how we can connect the sensors via this protocol. Generally,
    it is not required to do the core programming for the I2C, as it is lengthy and
    cumbersome. That's where the magic of open source comes in. There are a lot of
    developers across the globe who are working on these sensors and most of them

    communication. Due to the digital architecture of Raspberry Pi, it is difficult

    would happen in full range. Which for our ADC is from a voltage range of 0V to
    +/-4.096V.  Now changing the gain would result in change of the sensing range.
    I.e. if we change the value of gain to `2` Then the Range in which the sensing
    would happen would be Half of the original range i.w. 0 to +/- 2.048 Volts.

- en: 'The reason is simple. There are different types of analog sensors. Which give
    output in a wide variety of voltage range. Some sensors can give you output in
    the range of 0.5 volt to 4 volt others can give you from 0.1 volt to 0.98 volts.
    Now if we set the gain to `1` then the all of these sensors could be easily interfaced.
    As all of them fall in between the sensing range of 0 to 4.098 Volts. However
    as it is a 16 bit ADC hence the total number of discrete values that the ADC can
    provide would be in between 2^(16) or 65,536 readings. Hence at the gain of `1`
    the minimum voltage change that the ADC could detect would be: *4.096 */ *65536*
    = *0.000062*.'

    `0` to +/- 1.0245\. So this would be able to work with the output range between
    0.1 volt to 0.98 volt. But now lets see the minimum voltage change that it could
    detect: *1.0245* / *65536* = *0.00001563*.'

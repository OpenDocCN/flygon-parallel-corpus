    and similarly whenever we think about moving the wheels of a robot, we think about
    motors. There are various different types of motors that exist. So let''s firstly
    look at the most basic type of motor, which is called a brushed DC motor. As the
    name suggests, it works on a direct current. You may find such motors like this:'

- en: Trust me, these things are omnipresent, from the Christmas gift you bought for
    your neighbor to the biggest baddest machines out there—you will find these motors
    hiding under the hood. These motors are common for a reason and that is because
    they are very, very simple. So simple that powering them up only requires a battery
    and two wires. Simply connect the positive to one terminal and negative to the
    other, and the motor will start spinning. Interchange those connections and the
    direction of the rotation will change. Take two cells and double the voltage and
    the motor will spin even faster. It is that simple.

    and that we would be good to go. But unfortunately this is not going to be the
    case. As you may remember from the previous chapters, Raspberry Pi can only supply
    around 50 milliamps, but the consumption of a motor can be much higher. Hence,
    to run one we need an intermediate device.

    not? They can channel a huge amount of current and can handle high voltages. This
    should be the ideal choice. You would be right if you thought so, but only to
    some extent, and that is because a relay is simply a switch we can use to turn
    the motor on or off. We would not be able to control the speed or the direction
    of rotation of the motor. Now, you would think that this problem is not new and
    that we can very easily solve it by using **pulse width modulation** (**PWM**),
    right? Well, the answer is no! Because these relays are mechanical devices, and
    due to their mechanical nature, there are some maximum limits in terms of it being
    switched on or off in a second. Hence, it would not be able to cope with the frequency
    of PWM. Finally, we would still be left with the problem of changing the direction
    and the speed of the motor. So what do we do now?

    and the solution here is called a motor driver. A motor driver is primarily a
    set of electronic relays—a switch that can allow high currents yet is not mechanical.
    Hence, we can switch it hundreds of times every second. These electronic relays
    are either made of simple transistors or, in high power applications, they can
    even use MOSFETs for switching. We can simply give PWM to these electronic switches
    and get the voltage to modulate while making sure that enough current is being
    delivered to the circuit. Further, as I mentioned earlier, the motor driver is
    made of a set of these electronic relays. The most common and workable fashion
    in which they are arranged is called a full bridge or an H Bridge. Before I explain
    any further, let''s see what this is, exactly:'

    the motor switched off. Now, whenever we want to start the motor, we will have
    to switch on two switches in such a way that the circuit is complete and the motor
    starts working. So let''s see what it would look like:'

    high frequency at varying duty cycles to achieve a specific mean voltage. Now
    that we can achieve a specific speed for the motor by changing the voltage via
    these two switching circuits, let''s see how we are going to change the direction  of

    direction and then it will go in the other direction. The code is very straightforward
    and I don't think there is any need for explanation. All we are doing here is
    simply turning either of the two GPIOs connected to the motor driver on and off.
    Once the input IN 1 of the motor driver is activated, a part of the H-bridge is
    switched on, causing the motor to spin in one direction. Whenever the IN 2 of
    the motor driver is high, then the opposite part of H-bridge is turned on, causing
    the polarity at the output end of the motor driver to change, and hence the motor
    turns in the other direction.

    motor driver, it's time to take it a step further and control the speed of the
    motor using the motor driver. To do this, we don't really have to do much. The
    motor drivers are built to understand the PWM signals. Once the PWM signal to
    the motor driver is provided, then the motor driver in turn adjusts the output
    voltage for the motor and hence changes the speed of the motor driver. The PWM
    has to be provided on the same input ports IN 1 and IN 2 for motor A, and IN 3
    and IN 4 for motor B. It is obvious that the pin on which the PWM is provided
    will decide the direction in which the motor will move, and the duty cycle of
    the PWM will decide the speed at which the motor will be spinning.

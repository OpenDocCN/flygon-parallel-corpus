    The world is going all gaga over the inception of autonomous cars and within this
    decade this will become the new normal. There is so much going on in these vehicles.
    Multiple sensors, GPS, and telemetry are all calculated in real time to make sure
    that the car is on the right course and is being driven by the system safely on
    the road, so making a robotic vehicle proves to be an ideal way to learn robotics
    and future technologies. In this book, we will always try to make technologies
    that are not only as good as the present technologies but in some ways even better.
    So, let's go ahead and get to making this autonomous vehicle one step at a time.

    don''t already know? This may be true, but there are a few that we must make sure
    we understand before taking on this chapter. So, let''s get started.'

    and all the four wheels are independently controlled by a dedicated motor. Hence,
    we can change the speed of every single wheels as per our needs. We have chosen
    a four-wheel drive drivetrain as it is harder for it to get stuck on carpets and
    uneven surfaces. You can also opt for a two-wheel drive drivetrain if you want
    to do so, as it won''t make a huge difference.'

- en: Now, once you assemble the chassis you might see that it does not have a steering
    mechanism. Does this mean that the car will only go straight? Well, obviously
    not. There are many ways by which we can steer the direction of a car while making
    small vehicles. The best one is called differential turning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In conventional cars, there is one engine and that engine powers up the wheels;
    hence in principal all the wheels turn at the same speed. Now this works fine
    when we are going straight but whenever the car wants to turn there comes a new
    problem. Refer to the following diagram:'

    diameter and the one on the outer edge has a larger diameter. You may remember
    a fact from elementary school: the larger the diameter the more the circumference,
    and vice a versa. Hence, the wheel towards the inner edge will be covering a shorter
    distance compared to the wheels on the outer edge at the same time, or in simple
    words, the inner wheels will be spinning slower and the outer wheels will be spinning
    faster.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This problem leads to the discovery of differentials in cars, which is a round
    lump at the center of the axle of the car. What this does is that it varies the
    rate at which the wheels are spinning based on the turning radius. Genius, isn't
    it? Now, you must be thinking: this is all right, but why are you telling me all
    this? Well, because we will do the exact opposite to turn the robot. If we change
    the speed of the motors on the inner and outer edge of the turning circle, then
    the car will try to turn towards inside and similarly if we do it for the other
    end then it will try to turn in the other direction. While making wheeled robot
    this strategy is not new at all. Steering mechanisms are complicated and implementing
    them on small robot is simply a challenge. Hence this is a far simpler and easy
    way to turn your vehicle around.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only is this way simple but it is a very efficient and simple strategy that
    requires minimal components. It is also better as the turning radius of the vehicle
    is also reduced. In fact, if we spin the opposite sides of the wheels in the opposite
    direction at the same speed then the vehicle will turn completely on its own axis,
    making the turning radius entirely zero. this type of configuration is called
    skid-steer drive. For a robot that is wheeled and works indoors, this is a killer
    feature.

    unbox the vehicle chassis and screw every part together. The assembly manual generally
    comes along with the kit, so it won't take long for you to complete it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have completed building the kit, go ahead and segregate the wires for
    each of the motors. This is going to be a very important part of making the vehicle
    ready. So, once you have all the wires coming out of the vehicle, take a cell
    and power up each of the wheels. Notice the polarity of connection in which the
    wheels spin in the forward direction. All you have to do is to take a permanent
    marker or perhaps a nail paint and mark the wire which goes to the positive terminal
    when the motor is spinning in the forward direction. As all of these motors are
    entirely dependent on polarity for the direction, this step is key to ensure that
    whenever we power them up they always spin in the same direction. Trust me, this
    will save you a lot of headaches.

    the motor driver the command to spin the motor in one single direction. There
    might be a chance that a set of motors will be rotating in the reverse direction,
    in which case you should change the polarity of connections on the motor driver.
    This should solve the problem. Some people might think that we can make a change
    to the code as well to do this, but as per my experience it starts getting complicated
    from there and would cause you trouble if you chose the other path.

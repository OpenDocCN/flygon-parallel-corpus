    have started reading this book, did you ever imagine that things could be this
    simple? It is worth noting that everything starts off very simple and, slowly
    and steadily, with the need for more sophisticated systems, the complexity of
    the technology also increases. Go back to the time when personal computing was
    not really a thing. It was only used in business and companies such as IBM were
    only servicing business clients. At that time, people who wanted a personal computer
    had only one option. They needed to build it from scratch, and to be honest, a
    lot of people used to do that. It really wasn't that hard either at least from
    my perspective. But, in contrast to that time, think about what they have become
    right now. Ever thought of building a computer at home? By building, I mean designing
    everything and not just assembly of the CPU. It is not very easy.

    exotic; they were not very common, and they had very limited functionalities.
    However, with time and the brains of people, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and
    Hewlett and Packard, computers became more user-friendly, more easily available,
    and a desirable commodity. Think of the same thing with robots. They are expensive;
    for most people, there is not much they can do with them and also they are rare
    in the public space. But, as you have learned, it is not very hard to build a
    robot for our personal use, and with some tweaking here and there and with inventive
    minds such as yours, things can be taken in an altogether different direction.
    You could be the next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates. All we need is zeal, passion,
    and out-of-the-box thinking. You may be ridiculed for your vision. But do remember
    every inventor has been called mad at some point in time. So the next time someone
    calls you mad, you can be very sure that you are progressing!

    in a certain way. Hence, we react to different stimuli in a very known way. Like
    when it gets dark, our brain produces hormones that trigger sleep. Once the sunlight
    falls on our eyes, we tend to wake up. Well, at least this should be the case!
    In recent times, our lifestyle has changed enormously, which has started to defy
    this cycle. That's why, we are seeing more and more cases of insomnia. Waking
    up by an alarm is certainly not natural. Hence, you are never happy listening
    to an alarm in the morning, even if it has your favorite song as its tone. Our
    sleep cycle is supposed to be synchronized with the sunlight, but nowadays hardly
    anyone wakes up by this method. So, in this chapter, let's first make a smart
    alarm that will replicate the natural way we wake up.

    few chapters when we were making a gardening robot where we had to fetch water
    to the plants at a certain time. All it is doing at this time is to check the
    time and whether the time is `06` hours and the minute is less than `20`. That
    is, the light would be switched on between 07:00 hours to 07:19 hours. Thereafter,

    no matter whether you get up, the light would automatically switch itself off
    within 20 minutes. That is a bit of problem because not every time will you wake
    up in just 20 minutes. So, in that case, what should we do? The first thing we
    need to do is to detect whether you have woken up. This is very simple and not
    much needs to be told here. If you wake up in the morning, it is very certain
    that you will move out of the bed. Once you do, we can detect the motion that
    can tell our automated system whether you have really woken up.

    and based on that detection, we can be decisive on whether you have really woken
    up. This doesn't seem much of a task. All we need to do is to add a motion detection
    sensor. For this purpose, we can use a PIR sensor, which can tell us whether the
    motion has been detected. So, let's go ahead, add another layer of sensor on top
    of our system, and see what happens.

    `Irritation_flag`, and what this basically would be used for is to detect the

    0` as we have already declared in the beginning that the value of `Irritation_flag
    = 3`; hence, initially this condition will always be true. The last condition
    is `GPIO.input(PIR) == 0`; which means that the condition will only be satisfied
    when the PIR has not detected any motion. In very simple words, the alarm will
    go off every time between 07:00 and 07:15 if the PIR does not detect any motion:'

    the time is between 07:00 and 07:59 and whenever the motion is detected, the condition
    will be true. Once true, the program will first switch off the light using the
    line `GPIO.output*LIGHT,GPIO.LOW`. Once it is turned off, it waits for `10` seconds
    using `time.sleep(10)`. Once the time is over, it will implement the following
    operation: `Irritation_Flag - Irritation_Flag - 1`. Now what it does is that it
    decrements the value of `Irritation_Flag` by `1` every time it detects a motion.
    So the first time a motion happens, the value of `Irritation_Flag` would be `2`;
    thereafter, it would be `1`, and finally, it would be `0`.

    three times. Why three times? Because then the code `Irritation_Flag = Irritation

    light without properly waking up. So as in the code, the light would switch off
    whenever the motion was detected three times. But the motion can be anything.

    see what it is doing. In the line, `F-value = adc0.get_last_result()`, it is taking
    the value of the IR proximity sensor and storing it in `F_value`. Thereafter,
    in the line `F1 = (1.0/(F_value/13.15))-0.35`, we are simply calculating the distance
    in centimeters. We have already studied how this is happening, so not much explanation
    needs to be done here. The value of distance is stored in a variable named `F1`.
    Thereafter, using the function `time.sleep(0.1)`, we are pausing the program for
    `0.1` seconds. Thereafter, we are again repeating the same task again; that is,
    we are again taking the value of distance. But this time, the distance value calculated
    is stored in an another variable named `F2`. Finally, after all of this is done,
    we are calculating `F_final`, which is `F_final = F1 - F2`. So we are simply calculating
    the difference in distance between the first and the second reading. But, you
    must be asking why are we doing this. What good does it do?

    in distance. So if there is a change in the overall distance from first to last
    reading, then we can say that someone has passed through the IR sensor.

    Now, this imagination has become a reality. With the advent of smartphones, we
    have been doing stuff which one could have only imagined until a decade back.
    With mobile phones becoming smart, the industry and businesses have also tried
    their best to keep up with the disruptive change. However, there is one part that
    is still lagging behind. Which is that part? Your home!

    things! There are some devices that can turn on or off a bunch of devices such
    as your AC. However, the list is exhaustive. So, with all the knowledge gained
    in the previous chapters and the powerful hardware in our hands, why don't we
    become the trendsetters and the disrupters and make something that is still just
    a part of our imagination.

- en: In this chapter, we will be controlling devices in our home using our smartphones,
    but before doing this, we should understand the basics of this technology. The
    first topic of this chapter is IoT—the overused jargon in the modern world. It
    is something that everyone wants to know about but no one does. IoT can be related
    to a technology, where your refrigerator will tell you what items are low in supply
    and will order it automatically for you. Poor thing! This technology has some
    time to invade our houses. But IoT does not mean this alone. IoT is a very wide
    term, something which can be applied to almost all the places for optimization.
    So what is IoT then?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's break this acronym, **Internet of Things** sometimes also known as cyber
    physical systems. Now, what is **Things**? Any electronic object that has the
    ability to collect or receive data without human intervention can be called a
    thing here. So this thing can be your mobile, a pacemaker, a health monitoring
    device, and so on. The only *if* is that it should be connected to the internet
    and has the ability to collect and/or receive data. The second term is **Internet**;
    the internet refers to the internet, Duh! Now, all of these IoT devices send and
    receive data from a cloud or a central computer. The reason why it does that is
    because any IoT device, whether big or small, is considered a resource-constrained
    environment. That is, the resources such as computing power is much less. This
    is because the IoT devices have to be simple and cheap. Imagine you have to put
    IoT sensors on all of the street lights to monitor traffic. If the device costs
    $500, then it would be impractical to install this kind of device. However, if
    it could be made for $5-$10, then no one would bat an eye. That's the thing with
    IoT devices; they are extremely cheap. Now the flip side to this story is that
    they do not have a lot of computing power. Hence, to balance this equation, instead
    of computing the raw data on their own processors, they simply send this data
    to a cloud computing device or perhaps a server where this data is computed and
    the meaningful result is taken. So, this solves all our problems then. Well, no!
    The second problem with these devices are that they can be battery operated, use-and-throw
    devices as well. For example, where temperature sensors are installed all across
    the forests; in such situations, no one and absolutely no one will go and change
    the batteries every week. Hence, these devices are made in such a way that they
    consume little to almost no power, thereby making the programming very tricky.

- en: Now that we have understood the IoT concepts, in this chapter, we'll be making
    our home IoT enabled. This means, we will be able to receive and collect data
    from the sensors from our home, see it on our mobile devices, and if needed, we
    can control the devices using your smartphones as well. There is one thing though,
    instead of computing it on cloud, we will simply be uploading all of our data
    onto the cloud and just accessing that data or sending our data to the cloud from
    where it can be accessed. We will be talking about the cloud computing aspect
    in a different book as this can be a whole new dimension and will be out of the
    scope of this book.

- en: The MQTT protocol
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MQTT is an ISO-certified protocol and is in use very widely. The interesting
    thing about this protocol is that it was developed by Andy Stanford and Arlen
    Nipper in 1999 for monitoring of an oil pipeline through the desert. As you can
    imagine, in middle of a desert, the protocol they developed had to be energy efficient
    and bandwidth efficient as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How this protocol works is quite interesting. It has a publish-subscribe architecture.
    This means, it has a central server, which we also call a broker. Any device can
    register with this broker and publish any meaningful data onto it. Now, the data
    that is being published should have a topic, for example, air temperature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These topics are particularly important. Why, you may ask? To the broker, there
    can be one or many devices that can be connected. With the connection, they also
    need to subscribe to a topic. Let's say they are subscribed to the topic *Air-*Temperature.
    Now, whenever any new data comes, it gets published to the subscribed devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important thing to know is that there need not be any request to gain the
    data from the broker like what we have in HTTP. Rather, whenever the data is received,
    it will be pushed to the device which is subscribed to that topic. It is very
    obvious that the TCP protocol will also be up and working during the whole time
    and the port related to the broker will always be connected for seamless data
    transmission. However, should there be any break in the data, the broker will
    buffer all the data and send it to the subscriber whenever the connection is resumed.

- en: As you can see The motion sensor and the temperature sensors are giving the
    data to MQTT server by a specific topic namely **Temperature** and **Motion**.
    Those whose are subscribed to these topics would get the reading from this device.
    Hence there is no direct communication needed between the actual sensor and the
    mobile device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good thing about this whole architecture is that there can be limitless
    devices attached with this protocol and there need not be any scalability issues.
    Also, the protocol is relatively simple and easy to work with even a huge amount
    of data. Hence, this becomes the preferred protocol for IoT as it provides an
    easy, scalable, and seamless link between the data producer and the data receivers.

    if it is not, then the specific code will be returned notifying the error. So,

    the broker. Doing this is very simple. All we need to do is pass on the arguments
    of the broker which we want to connect to and the port which would be used. In
    our case, `broker = broker.hivemq.com` and `port = 1883`. So when we call the
    function, Raspberry Pi gets connected to our broker.'

    is that every time Raspberry Pi gets connected to the broker, it starts executing
    the `on_connect` function defined by us. This in-turn will send the data continuously to
    the broker after every 5 seconds, exactly the way in which we have defined in
    the function. This process is also called callback, which makes it event driven.
    That is, if it is not connected, it will not try to send the data to the broker.

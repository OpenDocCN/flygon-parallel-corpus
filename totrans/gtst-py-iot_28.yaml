- en: Since the beginning of time, humans have communicated with each other using
    gestures, even before there wasn't any formal language. Hand gestures were the
    primary way of communication, and it is also evident in the ancient sculptures
    found all across the world that the signs have been a successful way of transferring
    a huge amount of data in a very efficient way, sometimes, even more efficient
    than language itself.

    It also happens subconsciously even without our knowing. So, it becomes an ideal
    way of communication with various devices. However, the question remains, how?

- en: We can be sure that if we are talking about gestures, then we would surely have
    to do a lot of programming to identify the gestures in the videos; furthermore,
    it would require a huge amount of processing power to make it happen as well.
    Hence, it is out of the question. We can build some basic gesture-recognition
    system using an array of proximity sensors. However, the range of gestures recognized
    would be very limited, and the overall ports being used would be multiple fold.

    more than what it would deliver.

    along with it. These charges propagate through the space and go around an object.
    When that happens, the electric field associated with it has a specific characteristic.
    This characteristic will be the same till the time the environment around it is
    empty.

    sensed around it is only for about a few centimeters, so anything beyond that
    point can be disregarded. If there is nothing in that vicinity, then we can safely
    assume that the pattern of electric field being sensed would be unchanged. However,
    whenever an object such as our hand comes in the vicinity, then these waves are
    distorted. The distortion is directly linked to the position of the object and
    its position. With this distortion, we can sense where the finger is, and with
    constant sensing, we see what kind of motion is being performed. The board in
    question looks like this:'

    sides are rectangular structures that are four in number. These are the sensing
    elements. These sense the pattern of waves in the space. Based on it, they can
    derive what are the x, y, and z coordinates of the object. This is powered by
    a chip named MGC 3130\. This does all the computation and delivers the raw reading
    to the user, regarding the coordinates.

    Raspberry Pi and start using. However, once you do that, you will not be left
    with any GPIO pins. Hence, to save ourselves from that problem, we will be connecting
    it using male-to-female wires. This will give us access to the other GPIO pins
    and then we can have fun.

    to do a set of activities. These activities can be very large. Hence, to develop
    complex programs, there is a need for a lot of software engineers who work day
    and night to achieve a certain functionality. This is workable when the problem
    is well defined. But what about situations when the problem is also way complex?

    us to adapt to situations in a better and a more efficient way. Every time we
    do something, we know more. This makes us better at doing that task over a period
    of time. It is said practice makes a man perfect, and it is learning through doing
    things again and again that makes us better.

    Google here according to it, *It is a knowledge acquired through study, experience
    or being taught*. So, learning is basically a way of acquiring information from
    our surroundings to understand a process and its nature.

    lot of vision data in previous chapters when we were making the guard robot. You
    would be absolutely correct to think so. However, the learning can be done in
    different ways. What may work for one kind of problem can be futile for some other
    kind of problem. Hence, there are various types of learning algorithms and their
    principles. In this chapter, we will be focusing on an algorithm named **k-nearest
    neighbor**. It's named the **lazy algorithm**. I love this algorithm personally
    for classification. Why? Because technically there is no training phase. How?

- en: k-nearest neighbor is actually a smart algorithm. Rather than computing a regression
    of data provided and do a lot of mathematics calculations, it simply takes a structured
    data from the dataset provided. Whenever there is new data that has come in for
    prediction, then it simply searches the closest *k* match of the data provided
    by the user to the database based on its classification given. So, in this chapter,
    we will learn how this algorithm will work and how we can use it to make our home
    smart.

    chapter, we will be making a machine learning algorithm based on time and the
    temperature to predict whether the fan should be on or off. Hence, there are at
    least two things that should be provided by us to the system one being `Temperature`,
    and the other would be `Time` so that the prediction can take place. But one thing
    to remember is that we are talking about a supervised learning algorithm, so to
    train the model, we need to also give the outcome of `Temperature` and `Time`
    onto the state of the fan. Here, the state of the fan would be either on or off.
    Hence, we can depict it using `0` or `1`. Now let's go ahead and make a dataset
    by ourselves.

    important that the data has a distinct characteristic and its not random data.
    For example, in the preceding case, you can see that at `12.44` when the temperature
    is `28`, the fan will be on; however, at the same time, when the time is `12.13`
    and temperature is `21`, then the fan is off.

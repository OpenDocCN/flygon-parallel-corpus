    Normally, any time you need to store something in a list, you use python's built-in
    list implementation. In this chapter, however, we are more interested in understanding
    how lists work. So we are going to study list internals. As you will notice, there
    are different types of lists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python's list implementation is designed to be powerful and to encompass several
    different use cases. We are going to be a bit more strict in our definition of
    what a list is. The concept of a node is very important to lists. We shall discuss them
    in this chapter, but this concept will, in different forms, come back throughout
    the rest of the book.

    useful to remind ourselves what these are. To begin with, imagine that you have
    a house that you want to sell. Lacking time, you contact an agent to find interested
    buyers. So you pick up your house and take it over to the agent, who will in turn
    carry the house to anybody who may want to buy it. Ludicrous, you say? Now imagine
    that you have a few Python functions that work with images. So you pass high-resolution
    image data between your functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you don't carry your house around. What you would do is write the
    address of the house down on a piece of scrap paper and hand it over to the agent.
    The house remains where it is, but the note containing the directions to the house
    is passed around. You might even write it down on several pieces of paper. Each
    one is small enough to fit in your wallet, but they all point to the same house.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As it turns out, things are not very different in Python land. Those large image
    files remain in one single place in memory. What you do is create variables that
    hold the locations of those images in memory. These variables are small and can
    easily be passed around between different functions.

- en: We would normally say that `s` is a variable of the type set. That is, `s` is
    a set. This is not strictly true, however. The variable `s` is rather a reference
    (a "safe" pointer) to a set. The set constructor creates a set somewhere in memory
    and returns the memory location where that set starts. This is what gets stored
    in `s`.

- en: Arrays
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An array is a sequential list of data. Being sequential means that each element
    is stored right after the previous one in memory. If your array is really big
    and you are low on memory, it could be impossible to find large enough storage
    to fit your entire array. This will lead to problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the flip side of the coin is that arrays are very fast. Since each
    element follows from the previous one in memory, there is no need to jump around
    between different memory locations. This can be a very important point to take
    into consideration when choosing between a list and an array in your own real-world
    applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pointer structures
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Contrary to arrays, pointer structures are lists of items that can be spread
    out in memory. This is because each item contains one or more links to other items
    in the structure. What type of links these are dependent on the type of structure
    we have. If we are dealing with linked lists, then we will have links to the next
    (and possibly previous) items in the structure. In the case of a tree, we have
    parent-child links as well as sibling links. In a tile-based game where the game
    map is built up of hexes, each node will have links to up to six adjacent map
    cells.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are several benefits with pointer structures. First of all, they don't
    require sequential storage space. Second, they can start small and grow arbitrarily
    as you add more nodes to the structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This, however, comes at a cost. If you have a list of integers, each node is
    going to take up the space of an integer, as well as an additional integer for
    storing the pointer to the next node.

    of a doubly linked circular list, the first node also needs to point to the last
    node.

    is a special case, however. The very first loop iteration, `current` and `prev`,
    will point to the same node, namely the tail node. We want to ensure that the

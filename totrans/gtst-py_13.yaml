    being expressed recursively or iteratively or both. There are algorithms that

    the heap sort. As a recap, let''s create a simple heap with the following items:'

- en: The heap, `h`, is created and the elements in the `unsorted_list` are inserted.
    After each method call to `insert`, the heap order property is restored by the
    subsequent call to the `float` method. After loop has terminated, at the top of
    our heap will be element `4`.

- en: The number of elements in our heap is `10`. If we call the `pop` method on the
    heap object `h`, 10 times and store the actual elements being popped, we end up
    with a sorted list. After each `pop` operation, the heap is readjusted to maintain
    the heap order property.

- en: The `for` loop simply calls the `pop` method `self.size` number of times. `sorted_list`
    will contain a sorted list of items after the loop terminates.

- en: The `insert` method is called *n* number of times. Together with the `float`
    method, the `insert` operation takes a worst case runtime of **O**(*n log n*),
    as does the `pop` method. As such, this sorting algorithm incurs a worst case
    runtime of **O**(*n log n*).

- en: In this chapter, we have explored a number of sorting algorithms. Quick sort
    performs much better than the other sorting algorithms. Of all the algorithms
    discussed, quick sort preserves the index of the list that it sorts. We'll use
    this property in the next chapter as we explore the selection algorithms.

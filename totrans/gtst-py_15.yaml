    The syntax of a UML diagram is generally pretty obvious; you don't have to read
    a tutorial to (mostly) understand what is going on when you see one. UML is also
    fairly easy to draw, and quite intuitive. After all, many people, when describing
    classes and their relationships, will naturally draw boxes with lines between
    them. Having a standard based on these intuitive diagrams makes it easy for programmers
    to communicate with designers, managers, and each other.

    of classes that can be associated with each other. An object instance is a specific
    object with its own set of data and behaviors; a specific orange on the table
    in front of us is said to be an instance of the general class of oranges. That's
    simple enough, but let's dive into the meaning of those two words, *data* and
    *behaviors*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's start with data. Data represents the individual characteristics of a certain
    object. A class can define specific sets of characteristics that are shared by
    all objects from that class. Any specific object can have different data values
    for the given characteristics. For example, the three oranges on our table (if
    we haven't eaten any) could each weigh a different amount. The orange class could
    have a weight attribute to represent that datum. All instances of the orange class
    have a weight attribute, but each orange has a different value for this attribute.
    Attributes don't have to be unique, though; any two oranges may weigh the same
    amount. As a more realistic example, two objects representing different customers
    might have the same value for a first name attribute.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Attributes are frequently referred to as **members** or **properties**. Some
    authors suggest that the terms have different meanings, usually that attributes
    are settable, while properties are read-only. In Python, the concept of *read-only* is
    rather pointless, so throughout this book, we'll see the two terms used interchangeably.
    In addition, as we'll discuss in [Chapter 19](e639a907-22c5-4f1d-b125-f2b9a269c9f6.xhtml),

    these methods, we do not know or care if the television is getting its signal
    from a cable connection, a satellite dish, or an internet-enabled device. We don't
    care what electronic signals are being sent to adjust the volume, or whether the
    sound is destined for speakers or headphones. If we open the television to access
    the internal workings, for example, to split the output signal to both external
    speakers and a set of headphones, we will void the warranty.

    hiding**. It is also sometimes referred to as **encapsulation**, but encapsulation
    is actually a more all-encompassing term. Encapsulated data is not necessarily
    hidden. Encapsulation is, literally, creating a capsule (think of creating a time
    capsule). If you put a bunch of information into a time capsule, and lock and
    bury it, it is both encapsulated and the information is hidden. On the other hand,
    if the time capsule, has not been buried and is unlocked or made of clear plastic,
    the items inside it are still encapsulated, but there is no information hiding.

    as it is difficult to change it in the future. Changing the interface will break
    any client objects that are accessing it. We can change the internals all we like,
    for example, to make it more efficient, or to access data over the network as
    well as locally, and the client objects will still be able to talk to it, unmodified,
    using the public interface. On the other hand, if we alter the interface by changing
    publicly accessed attribute names or the order or types of arguments that a method
    can accept, all client classes will also have to be modified. When designing public
    interfaces, keep it simple. Always design the interface of an object based on
    how easy it is to use, not how hard it is to code (this advice applies to user
    interfaces as well).

    where each interaction involves viewing objects at an appropriate level of abstraction.
    But we don't know yet how to create these levels of abstraction. There are a variety
    of ways to do this; we'll discuss some advanced design patterns in [Chapter 21](b9232138-1747-4f88-b7ac-002c40332e92.xhtml),

    one. Composition is usually a good choice when one object is part of another object.
    We've already seen a first hint of composition in the mechanic example. A fossil-fueled
    car is composed of an engine, transmission, starter, headlights, and windshield,
    among numerous other parts. The engine, in turn, is composed of pistons, a crank
    shaft, and valves. In this example, composition is a good way to provide levels
    of abstraction. The **Car** object can provide the interface required by a driver,
    while also giving access to its component parts, which offers the deeper level
    of abstraction suitable for a mechanic. Those component parts can, of course,
    be further broken down if the mechanic needs more information to diagnose a problem
    or tune the engine.
  prefs: []

    when it comes to designing computer systems. Physical objects are easy to break
    into component objects. People have been doing this at least since the ancient
    Greeks originally postulated that atoms were the smallest units of matter (they,
    of course, didn't have access to particle accelerators). Computer systems are
    generally less complicated than physical objects, yet identifying the component
    objects in such systems does not happen as naturally.

    pieces. While this is unlikely or impossible in a computerized version of chess,
    it introduces us to **aggregation**.

    objects can exist independently. It would be impossible for a position to be associated

    the pieces, which might exist independently of the chess set, are said to be in
    an aggregate relationship with that set.

    about the lifespan of the object. If the composite (outside) object controls when

    If the related object is created independently of the composite object, or can
    outlast that object, an aggregate relationship makes more sense. Also, keep in
    mind that composition is aggregation; aggregation is simply a more general form
    of composition. Any composite relationship is also an aggregate relationship,

    in practice, the distinction between aggregation and composition is often irrelevant
    once you get past the design stage. When implemented, they behave in much the
    same way. However, it can help to differentiate between the two when your team
    is discussing how the different objects interact. Often, you can treat them as
    the same thing, but when you need to distinguish between them (usually when talking

    a **Board** object and decides which piece to move where. A very basic class might
    randomly choose a piece and direction and move it accordingly. We could then override
    this method in a subclass with the Deep Blue implementation. The first class would
    be suitable for play against a raw beginner; the latter would challenge a grand
    master. The important thing is that other methods in the class, such as the ones

    the ability to treat a class differently, depending on which subclass is implemented.
    We've already seen it in action with the pieces system we've described. If we
    took the design a bit further, we'd probably see that the **Board** object can
    accept a move from the player and call the **move** function on the piece. The
    board need not ever know what type of piece it is dealing with. All it has to

    it as a **Knight** or a **Pawn**.

    programming. Python goes an extra step past allowing a subclass of an object to
    be treated like a parent class. A board implemented in Python could take any object
    that has a **move** method, whether it is a bishop piece, a car, or a duck. When
    **move** is called, the **Bishop** will move diagonally on the board, the car
    will drive someplace, and the duck will swim or fly, depending on its mood.

    of birds without actually specifying an inheritance hierarchy for aquatic birds.
    It also allows them to create completely different drop-in behaviors that the

    allows a subclass to inherit functionality from multiple parent classes. In practice,
    multiple inheritance can be a tricky business, and some programming languages
    (most famously, Java) strictly prohibit it. However, multiple inheritance can
    have its uses. Most often, it can be used to create objects that have two distinct
    sets of behaviors. For example, an object designed to connect to a scanner and
    send a fax of the scanned document might be created by inheriting from two separate
    `scanner` and `faxer` objects.

    `move` method, and we want to merge them into the ultimate amphibious vehicle,
    how does the resulting class know what to do when we call `move`? At the design
    level, this needs to be explained, and, at the implementation level, each programming
    language has different ways of deciding which parent class's method is called,

    subjects, with specific titles, or by a particular author. Books can be uniquely
    identified by an **International Standard Book Number** (**ISBN**). Each book
    has a **Dewey Decimal System** (**DDS**) number assigned to help find it on a
    particular shelf.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    quickly identify **Book** as the most important object, with several attributes
    already mentioned, such as author, title, subject, ISBN, and DDS number, and catalog
    as a sort of manager for books.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also notice a few other objects that may or may not need to be modeled in
    the system. For cataloging purposes, all we need to search a book by author is
    an `author_name` attribute on the book. However, authors are also objects, and
    we might want to store some other data about the author. As we ponder this, we
    might remember that some books have multiple authors. Suddenly, the idea of having
    a single `author_name` attribute on objects seems a bit silly. A list of authors
    associated with each book is clearly a better idea.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    never say *a book is an author* (it's not inheritance), and saying *a book has
    an author*, though grammatically correct, does not imply that authors are part
    of books (it's not aggregation). Indeed, any one author may be associated with
    multiple books.
  prefs: []

    objects) *shelf*. Is a shelf an object that needs to be modeled in a cataloging
    system? How do we identify an individual shelf? What happens if a book is stored
    at the end of one shelf, and later moved to the beginning of the next shelf because
    a new book was inserted in the previous shelf?

    a DDS attribute with the book should be enough to locate it, regardless of which
    shelf it is stored on. So we can, at least for the moment, remove shelf from our
    list of contending objects.

    about tracking subscriptions or overdue notices. In the back of our minds, we

    be a useful inheritance relationship here in the future.

    and a DVD with *bunnies* in the title. At this point, the catalog doesn't care
    whether it is holding a DVD, book, CD, or magazine; all items are the same, as
    far as the catalog is concerned. However, the user wants to know how to find the
    physical items, so the catalog would be remiss if it simply returned a list of
    titles. So, it calls the **locate** method on the two items it has uncovered.
    The book's **locate** method returns a DDS number that can be used to find the
    shelf holding the book. The DVD is located by returning the genre and title of
    the DVD. The user can then visit the DVD section, find the section containing
    that genre, and find the specific DVD as sorted by the titles.

    It is bulky and fragile. It may do everything we need, but it feels like it will
    be hard to maintain or extend. There are too many relationships, and too many
    classes would be affected by modifications to any one class. It looks like spaghetti
    and meatballs.

- en: Now that we've explored inheritance as an option, and found it wanting, we might
    look back at our previous composition-based diagram, where **Contributor** was
    attached directly to **LibraryItem**. With some thought, we can see that we actually
    only need to add one more relationship to a brand-new class to identify the type
    of contributor. This is an important step in object-oriented design. We are now
    adding a class to the design that is intended to *support* the other objects,
    rather than modeling any part of the initial requirements. We are **refactoring**
    the design to facilitate the objects in the system, rather than objects in real
    life. Refactoring is an essential process in the maintenance of a program or design.
    The goal of refactoring is to improve the design by moving code around, removing
    duplicate code or complex relationships in favor of simpler, more elegant designs.

    the type of contribution the person has made to the given **LibraryItem**. There
    can be many such contributions to a particular **LibraryItem**, and one contributor
    can contribute in the same way to different items. The following diagram communicates
    this design very well:'

- en: 'At first, this composition relationship looks less natural than the inheritance-based
    relationships. However, it has the advantage of allowing us to add new types of
    contributions without adding a new class to the design. Inheritance is most useful
    when the subclasses have some kind of **specialization**. Specialization is creating
    or changing attributes or behaviors on the subclass to make it somehow different
    from the parent class. It seems silly to create a bunch of empty classes solely
    for identifying different types of objects (this attitude is less prevalent among
    Java and other *everything is an object* programmers, but it is common among more
    pragmatic Python designers). If we look at the inheritance version of the diagram,
    we can see a bunch of subclasses that don''t actually do anything:'

    This example of when not to use inheritance is a good reminder that objects are
    just tools, and not rules.

- en: This is a practical book, not a textbook. As such, I'm not assigning a bunch
    of fake object-oriented analysis problems to create designs for you to analyze
    and design. Instead, I want to give you some ideas that you can apply to your
    own projects. If you have previous object-oriented experience, you won't need
    to put much effort into this chapter. However, they are useful mental exercises
    if you've been using Python for a while, but have never really cared about all
    that class stuff.

    this object as possible. Did it have the following: Color? Weight? Size? Profit?
    Cost? Name? ID number? Price? Style?'

    of those attributes actually behaviors in disguise? Sometimes, what looks like
    data is actually calculated from other data on the object, and you can use a method
    to do those calculations. What other methods or behaviors did the object have?
    Which objects called those methods? What kinds of relationships did they have
    with this object?

    it might be a fun free-time project or a multi-million-dollar contract. It doesn't
    have to be a complete application; it could just be one subsystem. Perform a basic
    object-oriented analysis. Identify the requirements and the interacting objects.
    Sketch out a class diagram featuring the highest level of abstraction on that
    system. Identify the major interacting objects. Identify minor supporting objects.
    Go into detail for the attributes and methods of some of the most interesting
    ones. Take different objects to different levels of abstraction. Look for places
    where you can use inheritance or composition. Look for places where you should
    avoid inheritance.

    so if inclination meets both ambition and available time). The goal is to think
    about object-oriented design. Focusing on projects that you have worked on, or
    are expecting to work on in the future, simply makes it real.

    There are dozens, so find one that suits your preferred method of study. Sketch
    some class diagrams or a sequence diagram for the objects you identified earlier.
    Don't get too hung up on memorizing the syntax (after all, if it is important,
    you can always look it up again); just get a feel for the language. Something
    will stay lodged in your brain, and it can make communicating a bit easier if
    you can quickly sketch a diagram for your next OOP discussion.

- en: In this chapter, we took a whirlwind tour through the terminology of the object-oriented
    paradigm, focusing on object-oriented design. We can separate different objects
    into a taxonomy of different classes and describe the attributes and behaviors
    of those objects via the class interface. Abstraction, encapsulation, and information
    hiding are highly-related concepts. There are many different kinds of relationships
    between objects, including association, composition, and inheritance. UML syntax
    can be useful for fun and communication.

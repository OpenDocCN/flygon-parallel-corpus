- en: Unlike most of the patterns we reviewed in the previous chapter, the adapter
    pattern is designed to interact with existing code. We would not design a brand
    new set of objects that implement the adapter pattern. Adapters are used to allow
    two preexisting objects to work together, even if their interfaces are not compatible.
    Like the display adapters that allow you to plug your Micro USB charging cable
    into a USB-C phone, an adapter object sits between two different interfaces, translating
    between them on the fly. The adapter object's sole purpose is to perform this
    translation. Adapting may entail a variety of tasks, such as converting arguments
    to a different format, rearranging the order of arguments, calling a differently
    named method, or supplying default arguments.

    Decorators typically provide the same interface that they replace, whereas adapters
    map between two different interfaces. This is depicted in UML form in the following

    arguments)**. We already have this perfect **Interface2** class that does everything
    we want (and to avoid duplication, we don't want to rewrite it!), but it provides
    a method called **different_action(other, arguments)** instead. The **Adapter**
    class implements the **make_action** interface and maps the arguments to the existing
    interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is all in one place. The alternative would be really ugly; we'd have to perform
    the translation in multiple places whenever we need to access this code.

    to wonder what the programmer was thinking, using a specifically formatted string
    instead of using Python's incredibly useful built-in `datetime` library. As conscientious
    programmers who reuse code whenever possible, most of the programs we write will
    interact with `datetime` objects, not strings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have several options to address this scenario. We could rewrite the class
    to accept `datetime` objects, which would probably be more accurate anyway. But
    if this class had been provided by a third party and we don't know how to or can't
    change its internal structure, we need an alternative. We could use the class
    as it is, and whenever we want to calculate the age on a `datetime.date` object,
    we could call `datetime.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` to convert it to the proper
    format. But that conversion would be happening in a lot of places, and worse,
    if we mistyped the `%m` as `%M`, it would give us the current minute instead of
    the  month entered. Imagine if you wrote that in a dozen different places only
    to have to go back and change it when you realized your mistake. It's not maintainable
    code, and it breaks the DRY principle.

    interface to `strftime`) into a string that our original `AgeCalculator` can use.
    Now we can use the original code with our new interface. I changed the method
    signature to `get_age` to demonstrate that the calling interface may also be looking
    for a different method name, not just a different type of argument.

    with the original `AgeCalculator` class because the code calls `strip` on a specially
    formatted string, and `strip`, in that case, returns a tuple of year, month, and
    day. The `AgeCalculator` code only cares if `strip` exists and returns acceptable
    values; it doesn''t care if we really passed in a string. The following code really

    would be hard to maintain. We'd soon forget why we needed to add a `strip` method
    to a `date` class. The method name is ambiguous. That can be the nature of adapters,
    but creating an adapter explicitly instead of using inheritance usually clarifies
    its purpose.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of inheritance, we can sometimes also use monkey-patching to add a method
    to an existing class. It won't work with the `datetime` object, as it doesn't
    allow attributes to be added at runtime.  In normal classes, however, we can just
    add a new method that provides the adapted interface that is required by calling
    code. Alternatively, we could extend or monkey-patch the `AgeCalculator` itself
    to replace the `calculate_age` method with something more amenable to our needs.

    obviously fit the actual design of the adapter pattern, but if we recall that
    functions are essentially objects with a `__call__` method, it becomes an obvious
    adapter adaptation.

    makes some common assumptions about the connection, such as that the host for

    language readability, both the language and its libraries tend to provide easy-to-comprehend
    interfaces to complicated tasks. For example, `for` loops, `list` comprehensions,
    and generators are all facades into a more complicated iterator protocol. The
    `defaultdict` implementation is a facade that abstracts away annoying corner cases
    when a key doesn't exist in a dictionary. The third-party **requests** library
    is a powerful facade over less readable libraries for HTTP requests, which are
    themselves a facade over managing the text-based HTTP protocol yourself.

    tend to ignore memory optimization, assuming the built-in garbage collector will
    take care of them. This is usually perfectly acceptable, but when developing larger
    applications with many related objects, paying attention to memory concerns can
    have a huge payoff.

    memory for that shared state. It is normally implemented only after a program
    has demonstrated memory problems. It may make sense to design an optimal configuration
    from the beginning in some situations, but bear in mind that premature optimization
    is the most effective way to create a program that is too complicated to maintain.

    on **SpecificState**, that state needs to be passed into the **Flyweight** by
    the calling code. Traditionally, the factory that returns a flyweight is a separate
    object; its purpose is to return a flyweight for a given key identifying that
    flyweight. It works like the singleton pattern we discussed in [Chapter 22](f09b264b-a4c5-4a1e-9911-8f00ca74144c.xhtml),
    *Python Design Patterns I*; if the flyweight exists, we return it; otherwise,
    we create a new one. In many languages, the factory is implemented, not as a separate
    object, but as a static method on the `Flyweight` class itself.

    serial number and is a specific color. But most of the details about that car
    are the same for all cars of a particular model. For example, the Honda Fit DX
    model is a bare-bones car with few features. The LX model has A/C, tilt, cruise,
    and power windows and locks. The Sport model has fancy wheels, a USB charger,
    and a spoiler. Without the flyweight pattern, each individual car object would
    have to store a long list of which features it did and did not have. Considering
    the number of cars Honda sells in a year, this would add up to a huge amount of
    wasted memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the flyweight pattern, we can instead have shared objects for the list
    of features associated with a model, and then simply reference that model, along
    with a serial number and color, for individual vehicles. In Python, the flyweight
    factory is often implemented using that funky `__new__` constructor, similar to
    what we did with the singleton pattern.
  prefs: []

- en: Unlike the singleton pattern, which only needs to return one instance of the
    class, we need to be able to return different instances depending on the keys.
    We could store the items in a dictionary and look them up based on the key. This
    solution is problematic, however, because the item will remain in memory as long
    as it is in the dictionary. If we sold out of LX model Fits, the Fit flyweight
    would no longer be necessary, yet it would still be in the dictionary. We could
    clean this up whenever we sell a car, but isn't that what a garbage collector
    is for?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can solve this by taking advantage of Python's `weakref` module. This module
    provides a `WeakValueDictionary` object, which basically allows us to store items
    in a dictionary without the garbage collector caring about them. If a value is
    in a weak referenced dictionary and there are no other references to that object
    stored anywhere in the application (that is, we sold out of LX models), the garbage
    collector will eventually clean up for us.

    factory dictionary was deleted and a fresh one was created. If we then try to
    construct a second `CarModel` instance, however, it returns the same object (the
    IDs are the same), and, even though we did not supply any arguments in the second
    call, the `air` variable is still set to `True`. This means the object was not

    The actions that actually occur, such as `Exit`, `Save`, or `Copy`, are implementations

    what class of object will be returned. The underlying implementation returned
    may depend on a variety of factors, such as current locale, operating system,
    or local configuration.

    toolkits, database backends, and country-specific formatters or calculators. An
    operating-system-independent GUI toolkit might use an abstract factory pattern
    that returns a set of WinForm widgets under Windows, Cocoa widgets under Mac,
    GTK widgets under Gnome, and QT widgets under KDE. Django provides an abstract
    factory that returns a set of object relational classes for interacting with a
    specific database backend (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others) depending on
    a configuration setting for the current site. If the application needs to be deployed
    in multiple places, each one can use a different database backend by changing
    only one configuration variable. Different countries have different systems for
    calculating taxes, subtotals, and totals on retail merchandise; an abstract factory
    can return a particular tax calculation object.

    interface that supports these operations, and then use a composite object to represent
    folders, and leaf nodes to represent normal files.

    implementation, as in the example demonstrated earlier. Sometimes, if only a shallow
    tree is being created, we can get away with a list of lists or a dictionary of
    dictionaries, and do not need to implement custom component, leaf, and composite
    classes. Other times, we can get away with implementing only one composite class,
    and treating leaf and composite objects as a single class. Alternatively, Python's

    long as they have the correct interface.

    the `copy` method for the `File` and `Folder` objects in the previous section.
    The `File` method should be quite trivial; just create a new node with the same
    name and contents, and add it to the new parent folder. The `copy` method on `Folder`
    is quite a bit more complicated, as you first have to duplicate the folder, and
    then recursively copy each of its children to the new location. You can call the
    `copy()` method on the children indiscriminately, regardless of whether each is
    a file or a folder object. This will drive home just how powerful the composite
    pattern can be.

    pattern is suited to simplifying them. Flyweight is a complicated pattern and
    only useful if memory optimization is required. In Python, the command pattern
    is often more aptly implemented using first class functions as callbacks. Abstract
    factories allow runtime separation of implementations depending on configuration
    or system information. The composite pattern is used universally for tree-like

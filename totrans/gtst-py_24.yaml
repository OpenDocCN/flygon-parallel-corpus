    among them, feel free to skim this section. You'll find the next section–where
    we actually see how to create tests in Python–much more scintillating. If you're
    not convinced of the importance of testing, I promise that your code is broken,
    you just don't know it. Read on!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some people argue that testing is more important in Python code because of its
    dynamic nature; compiled languages such as Java and C++ are occasionally thought
    to be somehow *safer* because they enforce type checking at compile time. However,
    Python tests rarely check types. They check values. They make sure that the right
    attributes have been set at the right time or that the sequence has the right
    length, order, and values. These higher-level concepts need to be tested in any
    language.

- en: But why test? Do we really need to test? What if we didn't test? To answer those
    questions, write a tic-tac-toe game from scratch without any testing at all. Don't
    run it until it is completely written, start to finish. Tic-tac-toe is fairly
    simple to implement if you make both players human players (no artificial intelligence).
    You don't even have to try to calculate who the winner is. Now run your program.
    And fix all the errors. How many were there? I recorded eight in my tic-tac-toe
    implementation, and I'm not sure I caught them all. Did you?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need to test our code to make sure it works. Running the program, as we just
    did, and fixing the errors is one crude form of testing. Python's interactive
    interpreter and near-zero compile times makes it easy to write a few lines of
    code and run the program to make sure those lines are doing what is expected.
    But changing a few lines of code can affect parts of the program that we haven't
    realized will be influenced by the changes, and therefore neglect to test those
    parts. Furthermore, as a program grows, the number of paths that the interpreter
    can take through that code also grow, and it quickly becomes impossible to manually
    test all of them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To handle this, we write automated tests. These are programs that automatically
    run certain inputs through other programs or parts of programs. We can run these
    test programs in seconds and cover far more potential input situations than one
    programmer would think to test every time they change something.

- en: The first point really doesn't justify the time it takes to write a test; we
    can test the code directly in the interactive interpreter in the same time or
    less. But when we have to perform the same sequence of test actions multiple times,
    it takes less time to automate those steps once and then run them whenever necessary.
    It is a good idea to run tests every time we change code, whether it is during
    initial development or maintenance releases. When we have a comprehensive set
    of automated tests, we can run them after code changes and know that we didn't
    inadvertently break anything that was tested.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The last two of the preceding points are more interesting. When we write tests
    for code, it helps us design the API, interface, or pattern that code takes. Thus,
    if we misunderstood the requirements, writing a test can help highlight that misunderstanding.
    From the other side, if we're not certain how we want to design a class, we can
    write a test that interacts with that class so we have an idea of the most natural
    way to interface with it. In fact, it is often beneficial to write the tests before
    we write the code we are testing.

    takes the *untested code is broken code* concept one step further and suggests
    that only unwritten code should be untested. We don''t write any code until we
    have written the tests that will prove it works. The first time we run a test
    it should fail, since the code hasn''t been written. Then, we write the code that
    ensures the test passes, then write another test for the next segment of code.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, writing tests first forces us to consider exactly how the code will
    be used. It tells us what methods objects need to have and how attributes will
    be accessed. It helps us break up the initial problem into smaller, testable problems,
    and then to recombine the tested solutions into larger, also tested, solutions.
    Writing tests can thus become a part of the design process. Often, when we're
    writing a test for a new object, we discover anomalies in the design that force
    us to consider new aspects of the software.

- en: As a concrete example, imagine writing code that uses an object-relational mapper
    to store object properties in a database. It is common to use an automatically
    assigned database ID in such objects. Our code might use this ID for various purposes.
    If we are writing a test for such code, before we write it, we may realize that
    our design is faulty because objects do not have IDs assigned until they have
    been saved to the database. If we want to manipulate an object without saving
    it in our test, it will highlight this problem before we have written code based
    on the faulty premise.

    a separate, isolated test. Each test should be completely independent of other
    tests. Results or calculations from a previous test should have no impact on the
    current test. The key to writing good unit tests is keeping each test method as
    short as possible, testing a small unit of code with each test case. If our code
    does not seem to naturally break up into such testable units, it's probably a
    sign that the code needs to be redesigned.

    Test cases should never have side effects. In general, we group test methods into
    separate `TestCase` subclasses depending on what setup code they have in common.

    access an attribute that does not exist on the imitated class. You can also construct
    mock methods that return different arguments each time they are called by passing
    a list as the `side_effect` argument. The `side_effect` parameter is quite versatile;

    another sign that the API we are testing is poorly designed. Mocks should exist

    do this if you're starting a new project, but if you have existing code you need
    to work on, you can start by writing tests for each new feature you implement.
    This can become frustrating as you become more enamored with automated tests.
    The old, untested code will start to feel rigid and tightly coupled, and will
    become uncomfortable to maintain; you'll start feeling like changes you make are
    breaking the code and you have no way of knowing, for lack of tests. But if you
    start small, adding tests to the code base improves it over time.

    Once you've started to appreciate the benefits (you will) and realize that the

    you'll want to start writing tests for existing code. This is when you should
    start doing it, not before. Writing tests for code that we *know* works is boring.

    should follow quite naturally, as you will write a test before the code that satisfies
    that test. However, if writing tests for existing code, it is more likely that
    there will be edge conditions that go untested.

    an application by programmatically splitting the task between several workers.
    That was how the pyramids were built 4,500 years ago, and this method has not
    failed to deliver since then. But there is a limitation on how many laborers can
    be brought to work on the same project. The shared resources provide a ceiling
    to how much the workforce can be increased, whether the resources are counted
    in square feet and gallons (as the living quarters and water in the time of the
    pyramids) or in gigabytes and gigahertz (as the memory and processing power of
    a computer).

    very similar. However, we perceive the processing power of the human workforce
    and CPU quite differently. Historians tell us that thousands of ancient Egyptians
    worked on cutting and moving massive stone blocks at the same time. We do not
    have any problem understanding what they mean even if we know that these workers
    rotated all the time, some of them resting or attending to other matters temporarily
    and then coming back to replace the ones who have finished their annual assignment,
    others died or got injured and were replaced by the new recruits.

    executing at the same time, we automatically assume that they literally do what
    they are programmed to do in parallel. Only after we look under the hood of such
    a system we realize that such parallel processing is possible only when the threads
    are executed each by a different CPU. Otherwise, they time share the same processing
    power, and we perceive them working at the same time only because the time slots
    they use are very short--a fraction of the time units we have used in our everyday
    life. When the threads share the same resource, in computer science we say they
    do it concurrently.

    to the shared resources is possible, but it is quite the same from one application
    to another. That's why, after several releases of Java, the thread management
    plumbing became part of the standard JDK library as the `java.util.concurrent`
    package. This package has a wealth of interfaces and classes that support multithreading
    and concurrency. We will discuss how to use most of this functionality in the

    with an option of using a custom thread pool executor (more about this last option
    is explained later). But in most of the cases, a fixed-size thread pool executor

    application of the chance to utilize the available resources effectively. So,
    before selecting the pool size, it is advisable to spend some time on monitoring
    it and tuning JVM (see how to do it in one of the sections of this lesson) with
    the goal of the identification of the idiosyncrasy of the application behavior.
    In fact, the cycle deploy-monitor-tune-adjust has to be repeated throughout the
    application life cycle in order to accommodate and take advantage of the changes
    that happened in the code or the executing environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first parameter you take into account is the number of CPUs in your system,
    so the thread pool size can be at least as big as the CPU's count. Then, you can
    monitor the application and see how much time each thread engages the CPU and
    how much of the time it uses other resources (such as I/O operations). If the
    time spent not using the CPU is comparable with the total executing time of the
    thread, then you can increase the pool size by **time not using CPU/total executing
    time**. But that is in the case that another resource (disk or database) is not
    a subject of contention between the threads. If the latter is the case, then you
    can use that resource instead of the CPU as the delineating factor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assuming the worker threads of your application are not too big or too long
    executing and belong to the mainstream population of the typical working threads
    that complete their job in a reasonably short period of time, you can increase
    the pool size by adding the (rounded up) ratio of the desired response time and
    the time a thread uses CPU or another most contentious resource. This means that,
    with the same desired response time, the less a thread uses CPU or another concurrently
    accessed resource, the bigger the pool size should be. If the contentious resource
    has its own ability to improve concurrent access (like a connection pool in the
    database), consider utilizing that feature first.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the required number of threads running at the same time changes at runtime
    under the different circumstances, you can make the pool size dynamic and create
    a new pool with a new size (shutting down the old pool after all its threads have
    completed). The recalculation of the size of a new pool might be necessary also
    after you add to remove the available resources. You can use `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`
    to programmatically adjust the pool size based on the current count of the available
    CPUs, for example.

    property guarantees that its current value will be always read from the main memory,
    so each thread will see the updates done by the other threads. In our previous

    The `Schedulers` class has methods that generate thread pools dealing mostly with
    I/O operations (as in our example), or heavy on computation (method `computation()`),
    or creating a new thread for each unit of work (method `newThread()`), and several
    others, including passing in a custom thread pool (method `from(Executor executor)`).

- en: In this lesson, we have discussed the ways to improve Java application performance
    by using multithreading. We described how to decrease an overhead of creating
    the threads using thread pools and various types of such pools suited for different
    processing requirements. We also brought up the considerations used for selecting
    the pool size and how to synchronize threads so that they do not interfere with
    each other and yield the best performance results. We pointed out that every decision
    on the performance improvements has to be made and tested through direct monitoring
    of the application, and we discussed the possible options for such monitoring
    programmatically and using various external tools. The final step, the JVM tuning,
    can be done via Java tool flags that we listed and commented in the corresponding
    section. Yet more gains in Java application performance might be achieved by adopting
    the concept of reactive programming, which we presented as the strong contender
    among most effective moves toward highly scalable and highly performing Java applications.

    application into several microservices, each deployed independently and each using
    multiple threads and reactive programming for better performance, response, scalability,
    and fault-tolerance.

- en: In the previous lessons, we talked about possible ways to improve the performance
    of your Java application--from using the new command and monitoring tools to adding
    multithreading and introducing reactive programming and even to radically re-architecting
    your current solution into an unruly and flexible bunch of small independent deployment
    units and microservices. Without knowing your particular situation, there is no
    way for us to guess which of the provided recommendations can be helpful to you.
    That's why, in this lesson, we will describe a few recent additions to the JDK
    that can be helpful to you too. As we mentioned in the previous lesson, the gain
    in performance and overall code improvement does not always require us to radically
    redesign it. Small incremental changes can sometimes bring more significant improvements
    than we could have expected.

    the logistics of the delivery of the stones to the final destination--in order
    to shorten the construction time--it is often prudent to look closer at the tools
    the builders are using first. If each operation can be completed in half the time,
    the overall time of the project's delivery can be shortened accordingly, even
    if each of the stone blocks travels the same, if not a larger, distance.

- en: The `java.util.streams.Stream` interface was introduced in Java 8\. It emits
    elements and supports a variety of operations that perform computations based
    on these elements. A stream can be finite or infinite, slow or fast emitting.
    Naturally, there is always a concern that the rate of the newly emitted elements
    may be higher than the rate of the processing. Besides, the ability to keep up
    with the input reflects the application's performance. The `Stream` implementations
    address the backpressure (when the rate of the element processing is lower than
    their emitting rate) by adjusting the emitting and processing rates using a buffer
    and various other techniques. In addition, it is always helpful if an application
    developer makes sure that the decision about processing or skipping each particular
    element is made as early as possible so that the processing resources are not
    wasted. Depending on the situation, different operations can be used for filtering
    the data.

    helpful, but it would probably not be enough motivation to introduce these new
    factories. It was much more important to address the weakness of the existing
    implementation of `Collections.unmodifiableList()`, `Collections.unmodifiableSet()`,
    and `Collections.unmodifiableMap()`. Although the collections created using these
    methods throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` class when you try to modify
    or add/remove their elements, they are just wrappers around the traditional modifiable
    collections and can thus be susceptible to modifications, depending on the way
    you construct them. Let''s walk through examples to illustrate the point. By the
    way, another weakness of the existing unmodifiable implementation is that it does
    not change how the source collection is constructed, so the difference between
    `List`, `Set`, and `Map`--the ways in which they can be constructed--remains in
    place, which may be a source of bugs or even frustration when a programmer uses
    them. The new factory methods address this issue too, providing a more unified

    defect into an application. The new `Set` and `Map` implementations change the

    Java 8\. It is the next level of asynchronous call control over `java.util.concurrent.Future<T>`
    interface. It actually implements `Future`, as well as `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage<T>`.
    In Java 9, `CompletableFuture` was enhanced by adding new factory methods, support
    for delays and timeouts, and improved subclassing--we will discuss these features
    in more details in the sections to follow. But first, let's have an overview of
    the `CompletableFuture` API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The CompletableFuture API Overview
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `CompletableFuture` API consists of more than 70 methods, 38 of which are
    implementations of the `CompletionStage` interface, and five are the implementations
    of `Future`. Because the `CompletableFuture`class implements the `Future` interface,
    it can be treated as `Future` and will not break the existing functionality based
    on the `Future` API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So, the bulk of the API comes from `CompletionStage`. Most of the methods return
    `CompletableFuture` (in the `CompletionStage` interface, they return `CompletionStage`,
    but they are converted to `CompletableFuture`when implemented in `CompletableFuture`
    class), which means that they allow chaining the operations similar to how the
    `Stream` methods do when only one element goes through a pipe. Each method has
    a signature that accepts a function. Some methods accept `Function<T,U>`, which
    is going to be applied to the passed-in value `T` and return the result `U`. Other
    methods accept `Consumer<T>`, which takes the passed-in value and returns `void`.
    Yet other methods accept `Runnable`, which does not take any input and returns
    `void`. Here is one group of these methods:'

    or void (in the case of `Runnable`and `Consumer`). Each of them has two companion

    (or `CompletionStage`) objects produce a result that is used as an input to the
    action. By both, we mean the `CompletableFuture` that provides the method and
    the one that is passed in as a parameter of the method. From the name of these
    methods, you can quite reliably guess what their intent is. We will demonstrate
    some of them in the following examples. Each of these seven methods has two companions
    for asynchronous processing, too. This means that we have already described 30
    (out of 38) methods of the `CompletionStage` interface.

    of these two methods are present in the chain, then the exception will bubble
    up as any other Java exception. These two also have asynchronous companions, which

    that supports, among other things, the latest trends in reactive microservices
    because it allows processing data fully asynchronously as it comes in, splitting
    the flow if needed, and scaling to accommodate the increase of the input. We encourage
    you to study the examples (many more are provided in the code that accompanies
    this book) and look at the API at [http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html).

- en: In this lesson, we covered a lot of ground in the area of the new features introduced
    with Java 9\. First, we looked at many ways to stream filtering, starting with
    the basic `filter()` method and ending up using the `Stream` API additions of
    JDK 9\. Then, you learned a better way to analyze the stack trace using the new
    `StackWalker` class. The discussion was illustrated by specific examples that
    help you to see the real working code.

    and techniques you have learned to your project or, if it is not suitable for
    that, to build your own Java project for high performance. While doing that, try
    to solve real problems. That will force you to learn new skills and frameworks
    instead of just applying the knowledge you have already, although the latter is
    helpful too--it keeps your knowledge fresh and practical.

- en: The purpose of this book is to give readers a broad understanding of patterns
    in modern software development while diving into more detail with specific examples.
    The number of patterns used when developing solutions is vast, and often, developers
    use patterns without knowing they are doing so. This book covers patterns from
    low-level code, to high-level concepts used in solutions that run in the cloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though many of the patterns presented do not require a specific language, C#
    and .NET Core will be used to illustrate examples for many of them. C# and .NET
    Core were chosen due to their popularity and design, which supports building solutions
    from simple console applications to large-enterprise distributed systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Covering a large number of patterns, the book serves as a great introduction
    to many of them, while allowing a deeper, hands-on approach to a selected collection.
    The specific patterns covered have been selected as they illustrate a specific
    point or aspect of patterns. References to additional resources are provided to
    allow the reader to dive deeper into patterns of particular interest.

- en: From simple websites to large-enterprise distributed systems, the right pattern
    can make the difference between a successful, long-lived solution and a solution
    viewed as a failure due to its poor performance and high cost. This book covers
    many patterns that can be applied to build solutions that handle the inevitable
    change required to stay competitive in business, as well as achieve the robustness
    and reliability expected of modern applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The target audience is modern application developers working in a collaborative
    environment. Intentionally, this represents a great number of backgrounds and
    industries as the patterns can be applied to a wide range of solutions. As this
    book dives into the code to explain the patterns covered, readers should have
    a background in software development—this book should not be viewed as a *how
    to program* book but more of a *how to program **better*** book. Because of this,
    the target audience will range from junior developers to senior developers, to
    software architects and designers. For some readers, the content will be new;
    for others, it will be a refresher.

- en: This book does assume some familiarity with OOP and C#. Though this book covers
    advanced topics, it is not designed to be a comprehensive development guide. Instead,
    the goal of the book is to advance the skill levels of developers and designers
    by providing a wide array of patterns, practices, and principles. Using a toolboxanalogy,
    the book provides a large number of tools for the modern application developer
    by progressing from low-level code design to higher-level architecture, as well
    as important patterns and principles commonly used today.

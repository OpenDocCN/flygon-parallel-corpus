- en: For over 20 years, the most popular programming languages have been based on
    the principles of **object-oriented programming** (**OOP**). The rise in popularity
    of OOP languages is largely to do with the benefits of being able to abstract
    complex logic into a structure, called an object, that can be more easily explained,
    and, more importantly, reused within an application. In essence, OOP is a software
    design approach, that is, a pattern for developing software using the concept
    of objects that contain data and functionality. As the software industry matured,
    patterns appeared in OOP for commonly occurring problems, as they were effective
    in solving the same problems but across different contexts and industries. As
    software moved from the mainframe to client servers and then to the cloud, additional
    patterns have emerged to help in reducing development costs and improving reliability.
    This book will explore design patterns, from the foundation of OOP to the architecture
    design patterns for cloud-based software.

    face during development, and are built from the experience of what works and what
    doesn''t. These solutions are trialed and tested by numerous developers in various
    situations. The benefits of using a pattern based on this previous activity ensure
    that the same efforts are not repeated again and again. In addition to this, using
    a pattern adds a sense of reliability that the problem will be solved without
    introducing a defect or issue.'

- en: OOP refers to a software programming approach that uses objects defined as classes.
    These definitions include fields, sometimes called attributes, to store data and
    methods in order to provide functionality. The first OOP language was a simulation
    of real systems known as Simula ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula))
    and was developed at the Norwegian Computing Center in 1960\. The first pure OOP
    language came into existence in 1970 as the Smalltalk ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk))
    language. This language was designed to program the Dynabook ([http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Dynabook.html](http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Dynabook.html)),
    which is a personal computer created by Alan Kay. Several OOP languages evolved
    from there, with the most popular being Java, C++, Python, and C#.

    to maintain. OOP offered a new paradigm in software development that had advantages
    over other approaches. The concept of organizing code into objects is not difficult
    to explain and this is a huge advantage for the adoption of a new pattern. Many
    examples can be taken from the real world in order to explain the concept. Complex
    systems can also be described using smaller building blocks (that is, an *objects*).
    These allow developers to look at sections of the solution individually while
    understanding how they fit into the entire solution.

    instructions are an abstract representation of a house. A class is similar as
    it defines the features of an object. An object is then created from the definition
    of a class. This is often called **instantiating the object***.*

    to associations, objects have their own life cycle in aggregations, but it involves ownership.
    This means that a child object cannot belong to another parent object. Aggregation
    is a one-way relationship where the lives of the objects are independent from
    each other. For example, the child and parent relationship is an aggregation, because
    every child has a parent but it''s not necessary that every parent has a child.'

    and introducing a `PetOwner` class. The `PetOwner` class could be associated with
    one or more `PetAnimal` instances. As the `PetAnimal` class can exist with or
    without having an owner, the relationship is an aggregation. `PetAnimal` is related
    to `PetColor` and, in this system, `PetColor` only exists if it is related to
    `PetAnimal`, making the association a composition.

    `-`, as we will cover access modifiers when we discuss encapsulation later. The
    associations are shown with a line connecting the classes. In the case of compositions,
    a solid diamond on the side of the parent is used, whereas an open diamond on
    the side of the parent is used to show aggregations. Additionally, note that the
    diagram supports a multiplicity value that indicates the number of possible children.
    In the diagram, a `PetOwner` class can have `0` or more `PetAnimal` classes (note
    that ***** indicates no enforced limit to the number of associations).

    the interface does not provide implementation. Interfaces cannot contain attributes.

    classes allows us to define an *is-a-type-of relationship*; for example, a car
    *is a type of* vehicle. The importance of this concept is that it allows for objects
    of the same type to share similar features. Let's say that we have a system for
    managing different products of an online bookstore. We might have one class for
    storing information about a physical book and a different one for storing information
    about a digital or online book. The features that are similar between the two,
    such as the name, publisher, and author, could be stored in another class. Both
    the physical and digital book classes could then inherit from the other class.

    be used as well as helping to prevent a class from being handled incorrectly.
    For example, let's say we wanted to only allow adding `PetAnimal` objects by using
    the `AddPet(PetAnimal)` method. We would do this by having the `PetOwner` class's
    `AddPet(PetAnimal)` method available while having the `Pets` attribute restricted to
    anything outside the `PetAnimal` class. In C#, this is possible by making the
    `Pets` attribute private. One reason for doing this would be if additional logic
    was required whenever a `PetAnimal` class was added, such as logging or validating
    that the `PetOwner` class could have a pet.

    them in order to ensure that only the base class, `PetAnimal`, can change their
    values. The constructor of `PetAnimal` was protected to ensure only a child class
    could access it. In this application, only classes within the same library as
    the `Dog` class have access to the `RegisterInObedienceSchool()` method.

    TF>`. The `where` keyword is used to indicate additional requirements as to what
    `TP` and `TF` must be. In this example, the `where` keyword defines `TP` as having
    to be a type of `PetAnimal`, while `TF` must implement the `IPetFood` interface.

    encapsulation, and polymorphism. Using these features, the classes within an application
    can be abstracted to provide definitions that are both easy to understand and
    protected against being used in a manner that is inconsistent with its purpose.
    This is an essential difference between OOP and some earlier types of software
    development language such as structural and procedural programming. With the ability
    to abstract functionality, the ability to reuse and maintain code is increased.'

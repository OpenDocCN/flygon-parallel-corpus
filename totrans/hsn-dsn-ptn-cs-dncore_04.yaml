- en: In this section, readers will get hands-on experience with various design patterns.
    Specific patterns will be illustrated in the process of building a sample application
    for maintaining an inventory application. An inventory application was chosen
    as it is conceptually simple but will provide enough complexity to benefit from
    the use of patterns during development. Certain patterns and principles will be
    revisited more than once, such as SOLID, **Minimal Viable Product** (**MVP**),
    and **Test-driven development** (**TDD**). By the end of this section, readers
    will be able to write neat and clean code with the help of various patterns.

- en: In the previous chapter, we introduced FlixOne and the initial development of
    a new inventory management application. Several patterns were used by the development
    team, ranging from patterns designed to limit the scope of a deliverable such
    as a **Minimum Viable Product** (**MVP**) to patterns to assist in the development
    of the project such as **Test Driven Development** (**TDD**). Several patterns
    from the **Gang of Four** (**GoF**) were also applied as a solution to leverage
    how others have solved similar problems in the past so that we don't repeat common
    mistakes. Single responsibility principle, Open–closed principle, Liskov substitution
    principle, Interface Segregation principle, and Dependency inversion principle
    (SOLID principles) were applied to ensure we are creating a stable code base that
    will help in the management and future development of our application.

- en: This chapter will continue to explain the building of the FlixOne inventory
    management application by incorporating more patterns. More of the GoF patterns
    will be used, including the singleton and factory patterns. A singleton pattern
    will be used to illustrate the repository pattern that is used to maintain the
    FlixOne collection of books. The factory pattern will further the understanding
    of the **Dependency Injection** (**DI**). Finally, we will use the .NET Core framework
    to facilitate an **Inversion of Control** (**IoC**) container that will be used
    to complete the initial inventory management console application.

- en: The singleton pattern
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The singleton pattern is another GoF design pattern that is used to restrict
    the instantiation of a class to one object. It is used in situations where actions
    within a system need to be coordinated or access to data needs to be limited.
    For example, if access to a file needs to be restricted within an application
    to a single writer, then a singleton could be used to prevent multiple objects
    from trying to write to the file at the same time. In our scenario, we are going
    to use a singleton to maintain the collection of books and their inventory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The value of the singleton pattern is more apparent when it is illustrated using
    examples. This section will start with a basic class and then go on to identify
    the different issues that the singleton pattern addresses. These issues will be
    identified, and the class will be updated and then verified by unit tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The singleton pattern should only be used when necessary as it can introduce
    a potential bottleneck for the application. Sometimes, the pattern is viewed as
    an anti-pattern as it introduces global state. With global state, unknown dependencies
    within an application are introduced and it then becomes unclear as to how many
    types might depend on the information. Additionally, many frameworks and repositories
    already limit access when required, so introducing an additional mechanism might
    limit the performance unnecessarily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: .NET Core provides support for a number of the patterns discussed. In the next
    chapter, we will take advantage of the `ServiceCollection`class's support for
    both the factory method and the singleton pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our scenario, the singleton pattern will be used to hold an in-memory repository
    containing a collection of books. The singleton will prevent the collection of
    books from being updated by more than one thread at a time. This will require
    us to *lock* a section of the code to prevent unpredictable updates.

    the .Net Framework, an application will be composed of lightweight, managed subprocesses
    called application domains that can comprise one or more managed threads. For
    the purpose of understanding the singleton pattern, let's define this as a multithreaded
    application that contains one or more threads running simultaneously. Technically,
    the threads are actually not running simultaneously, but this is achieved by dividing
    the available processor time between the threads, so that each thread will execute
    for a small amount of time and then the thread will suspend activity, allowing
    for another thread to execute.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Going back to the singleton pattern, in a multithreaded application, special
    care needs to be taken to ensure that access to the singleton is limited so that
    only one thread enters specific areas of logic at a time. Because of this synchronization
    of threads, it is possible for one thread to retrieve a value and update it, and,
    before it can be stored, another thread also updates the value.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The singleton pattern that is introduced to the project is applied to a class
    being used to maintain the inventory's collection of books. The singleton will
    prevent access from multiple threads being handled incorrectly, and, another pattern,
    the repository pattern, will be used to create a facade over the data that is
    being managed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The repository pattern provides an abstraction over a repository to provide
    a layer between the business logic of an application and the underlying data.
    This provides several advantages. By having a clean separation, our business logic
    can be maintained and unit tested independently of the underlying data. Often,
    the same repository pattern class can be reused by multiple business objects.
    An example of this could be `GetInventoryCommand`, `AddInventoryCommand`, and
    `UpdateInventoryCommand` objects; all of these objects use the same repository
    class. This allows us to test the logic in these commands in isolation from the
    repository. Another advantage of the pattern is that it enables centralized data-related
    policies to be more easily implemented, such as caching.

    introduces a **creator** whose responsibility is the instantiation of implementations
    of a specific type. Its purpose is to encapsulate the complexity around constructing
    types. The factory pattern allows for more flexibility as the application changes,
    by limiting the amount of required change compared to whether the construction
    was in the calling class. This is because the complexity of the construction is
    in one location, instead of distributed in multiple locations across the application.

    shields the details of constructing each of the different `InventoryCommand` instances.
    In this scenario, the input received from the console application will be used

- en: .NET Core was designed with **Dependency Injection** (**DI**) built-in to the
    framework. Typically, the start of a .NET Core application contains the set up
    of the DI for an application that primarily contains the creation of a collection
    of services. The framework uses these services to supply the dependencies when
    the application requires them. The services provide the foundation of a robust
    **Inversion of Control** (**IoC**) framework and are arguably one of the coolest
    features of .NET Core. This section will complete the console application and
    demonstrate how .NET Core supports building a sophisticated IoC framework based
    on the `IServiceCollection` interface.

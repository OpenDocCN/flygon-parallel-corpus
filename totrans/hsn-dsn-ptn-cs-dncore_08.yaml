    application (see [Chapter 3](3a038a92-9207-4232-9acd-d17cb24da6c5.xhtml), *Implementing
    Design Patterns Basics – Part 1*), and we will discuss the conversion of a console
    application to a web application. The web application should be more appealing
    to users, as opposed to a console application; Here, we will also discuss why
    we are going for this change.

- en: Web applications are one of the best implementations of the client-server architecture. A
    web application can be a small piece of code, a program, or a complete solution
    for a problem or a business scenario in which users interact with one another
    or with the server, using browsers. A web application serves requests and responses
    via browsers, mainly through the use of **HyperText Transfer Protocol** (**HTTP**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    happen: the client initiates the request and the server generates the response.
    This communication is made up of HTTP requests and HTTP responses. For more information,

- en: From this diagram, you can easily see that with the use of a browser (as a client),
    you're opening doors for millions of users who can access the website from anywhere
    in the world and can interact with you as a user. With a web application, you
    and your customers can communicate easily. Generally, effective engagement is
    only possible when you capture and store the data with all the necessary information
    required for your business and your users. This information is then processed,
    and the results are presented to your users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, web applications use a combination of server-side code to handle
    the storage and retrieval of the information, and client-side scripts to present
    the information to the users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The web application requires a web server (such as **IIS** or **Apache**) to
    manage requests coming from the client (from the browser, as can be seen in the
    previous diagram). An application server (such as IIS or Apache Tomcat) is also
    required to perform the tasks requested. A database is sometimes needed to store
    the information as well.
  prefs: []

- en: Put simply, both a web server and an application server are designed to serve
    HTTP content, but with certain variations. Web servers serve static HTTP content,
    such as HTML pages. Application servers can, apart from serving static HTTP content,
    also serve dynamic content, using different programming languages. For more information,
    refer to [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/936197/what-is-the-difference-between-application-server-and-web-server](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/936197/what-is-the-difference-between-application-server-and-web-server).

    depends on the `InventoryContext` for database operations and interacts with our

    use the `IInventoryRepository` interface to interact with the repository for CRUD

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We started the chapter by discussing business requirements, why we needed a
    web application, and why we wanted to upgrade our console application. We then
    covered the step-by-step creation of a web application using Visual Studio in
    the MVC pattern. We also discussed how a web application can work as a client-server
    model, and looked at user interface patterns. We also started building CRUD pages.

    design patterns for web applications.

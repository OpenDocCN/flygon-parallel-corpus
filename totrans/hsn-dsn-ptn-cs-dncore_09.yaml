    application to a web application while illustrating different patterns. We also
    covered **User Interface** (**UI**) architectural patterns such as **Model-View-Controller**
    (**MVC**), **Model View Presenter** (**MVP**), and others. The previous chapter
    aimed to discuss patterns such as MVC. We now need to extend our existing application
    to incorporate more patterns.

    entry into a specific conference hall. At the gate of a conference hall, you have
    to buy a ticket, making a payment with cash or by card. While you''re making a
    payment, the counter assistant could enter your details into the system, print
    an invoice, and provide you with the ticket. Now consider that there are more
    people who want to buy a ticket. Each person has to perform the required activities
    to collect the ticket from the ticket counter. In this case, only one person can
    be served at a time from one counter, and the rest of the people wait for their
    turn. Let''s assume that one person takes two minutes to collect their ticket
    from the counter; the next person, therefore, needs to wait for two minutes for
    their turn. Consider the wait time of the last person in line if it is a queue
    of 50 people. Things can be changed here. If there were two more ticket counters
    and every counter is performing the tasks in two minutes, this means that every
    two minutes, three people will be able to collect three tickets—or three counters
    are selling two tickets every two minutes. In other words, every ticket counter
    is performing the same task (that is, ticket selling) at the same point in time.
    This means all counters are served in parallel; therefore, they are concurrent.
    This is depicted in the following diagram:'

    of people are in the queue (for example, 10,000 people); there is no use in performing
    parallelism here, as this would not resolve the issue of a likely bottleneck in
    this operation. On the other hand, you can increase the number of counters to
    50\. Will they resolve this problem? These kinds of problems would occur while

    separately from the main application thread, and it tells the calling thread that

    that the code is not processed in sequence and the IDs are not coming through
    in sequence/order, as we can see `Id` `13` comes after `9` but before `10`. If
    these were running in sequence, then the order of the `Id`s would be `9`, `10`,
    and then `13`.

    allows us to perform in-memory query operations by using arbitrary sequences of
    objects. `LINQ-to-Objects` is a collection of extension methods on top of `IEnumerable<T>`.

- en: In this chapter, we discussed concurrent programming and concurrency in the
    real world. We looked at how we can handle various scenarios related to concurrency
    in our day-to-day life. We looked at collecting conference tickets from serving
    counters, and we understood what parallel programming and concurrent programming
    are. We have also covered multithreading, `Async`/`Await`, `Concurrent` collection,
    and PLINQ.

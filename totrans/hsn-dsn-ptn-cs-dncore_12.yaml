    Programming in .NET Core*) introduced concurrent programming in .NET Core, and

    to make our program more performant.

    a functional way. In mathematics, we have formulas and, in functional programming,
    we use math in the form of various functions. The best part of functional programming
    is that it helps to implement concurrency seamlessly.

    based on the current price and discount. In this case, the output of the method
    will never change for the supplied parameter values. In this way, the product
    with a price of `190.00` and a discount of `10.00` will be calculated in this
    way: `190.00 * 10.00 /100`, and this will return `19.00`. Our next method—`PriceAfterDiscount`—with

    we used `LINQ Query`. In this, we are iterating a collection and returning an
    item if it meets the criteria. The preceding code can be further simplified. Consider

    previously discussed `Where` method. This method is criteria-based and has a strategy
    to return results, and this criterion executes at runtime. We can easily call
    the preceding function in a subsequent method to take advantage of functional
    programming. Consider the following code:'

    the price. This method is self-explanatory, and it works on a collection of `ProductViewModel`
    with a criteria to list the products that have a product price that is more than
    the parameter price. In our `FlixOne` inventory application, you can find further
    scope to implement functional programming.

    functions. Any language that supports functional programming always works on the
    solution with two main questions: what needs to be solved and how can this be
    solved? We saw functional programming and its easy implementation using the C#
    programming language.'

    closures, expression trees, currying, closures, and recursion. Finally, we looked into
    the implementation of the strategy pattern using functional programming.

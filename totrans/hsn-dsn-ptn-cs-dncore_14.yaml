- en: Similar to the other topics we have covered in this book, there are a large
    number of databases ranging from basic patterns concerning the schema of a database
    to patterns that govern how database systems are put together. This section will
    cover two system patterns, **Online Transaction Processing** (**OLTP**) and **Online
    Analytical Processing** (**OLAP**). To further understand database design patterns,
    we will explore a specific pattern, ledger-style databases, in more detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A database schema is another word for the collection of tables, views, stored
    procedures, and other components that make up a database. Think of this as the *blueprint*
    of the database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OLTP
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An OLTP database has been designed to handle large numbers of statements that
    cause changes to the database. Basically, the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`
    statements all cause changes and behave very differently from the `SELECT` statement.
    OLTP databases have been designed with this in mind. Because these databases record
    changes, they are typically the *main *or *master*database, meaning that they
    are the repositories that hold the current data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `MERGE` statement also qualifies as a statement that causes change. This
    is because it provides a convenient syntax for the insertion of a record when
    a row does not exist, and the insertion of an update when a row does exist. It
    will update when a row does exist. The `MERGE` statement is not supported in all
    database providers or versions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OLTP databases are typically designed to process change statements quickly.
    This is normally done by the careful planning of table structures. A simple way
    of viewing this is to consider a database table. This table can have fields for
    storing data, keys for looking up the data efficiently, indexes to other tables,
    triggers to respond to specific situations, and other table constructs. Each one
    of these constructs has a performance penalty. The design of OLTP databases is,
    therefore, a balance between using the minimum number of constructs on a table
    versus the desired behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's consider a table that records the books in our inventory system. Each
    book might record the name, quantity, date published, and have references to author
    information, publishers, and other related tables. We could put an index on all
    columns and even add indexes for the data in related tables. The problem with
    this approach is that each index has to be stored and maintained for each statement
    that causes change. Database designers have to carefully plan and analyze databases
    in order to determine the optimal combination of adding and, just as importantly,
    not adding indexes and other constructs to tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A table index can be thought of like a virtual lookup table that provides the
    relational database with a faster way of looking up data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OLAP
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Databases designed using the OLAP pattern are expected to have more `SELECT`
    statements than statements that cause change. These databases usually have a consolidated
    view of the data of one or more databases. Because of this, these databases are
    usually not the master database, but a database used to provide reporting and
    analysis separate from the master database. In some situations, this is provided
    on infrastructure isolated from other databases so as to not impact the performance
    of operational databases. This type of deployment is often referred to as a **data
    warehouse**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A data warehousecan be used to provide a consolidated view of a system or collection
    of systems within an enterprise. The data is traditionally fed with slower periodical
    jobs to refresh the data from other systems, but with modern database systems,
    this is trending towards near real-time consolidation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The major difference between OLTP and OLAP is around how the data is stored
    and organized. In many situations, this would require tables or persistent views—depending
    on the technology used—to be created in the OLAP database that supports specific
    reporting scenarios and duplicates the data. In OLTP databases, duplication of
    data is undesirable as it then introduces multiple tables that need to be maintained
    for a single statement that causes change.

- en: 'The ledger-style database design will be highlighted, as it is both a pattern
    that has been used in many financial databases for decades and it may not be known
    to some developers. The ledger-style database stems from an accountant''s ledger,
    where transactions were added to a document and the quantities and/or amounts
    are tallied in order to arrive at a final quantity or amount. The following table
    shows a ledger of the sale of apples:'

- en: There are a couple of things to point out about the example. The Purchaser information
    is written on separate rows instead of erasing their amounts and entering a new
    amount. Take the two purchases and one credit for West Country Produce. This is
    typically different from many databases in which a single row contains the Purchaser
    information with separate fields for the Amount and Price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A ledger-style database takes this concept by having a separate row per transaction,
    thus removing the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements and only relying on `INSERT`
    statements. This has several benefits. Similarly to a ledger, once each transaction
    has been written it cannot be removed or changed. If a mistake or a change occurs,
    such as the credit to West Country Produce, a new transaction needs to be written
    in order to arrive at the desired state. An interesting benefit of this is that
    the source table now has the immediate value of providing a detailed log of the
    activity. If we were to add a *modified by* column, we could then have a comprehensive
    log of who or what made the change and what the change was.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example is for a single-entry ledger, but in the real world, a double-entry
    ledger would be used. The difference is that in a double-entry ledger, each transaction
    is recorded as a credit in one table and a debit in another.

- en: While this would be fine for smaller data sizes, the issue here is that the
    performance of the query would degrade over time as the number of rows increases.
    An alternative would be to aggregate the data into another form. There are two
    main ways of achieving this. The first is to perform this activity at the same
    time as you write the information from the ledger table into another table (or
    persistent view if supported) that holds the data in an aggregate form.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **persistent** or **materialized view** is similar to a database view, but
    the results of the view are cached. This gives us the benefit of not requiring
    the view to be recalculated on each request, and it is either refreshed periodically
    or when the underlying data changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second approach relies on another mechanism that is separate from the `INSERT`
    statement to retrieve the aggregated view when required. In some systems, the
    primary scenario of writing changes to a table and retrieving the result is performed
    less frequently. In this case, it would make more sense to optimize the database
    so that writes are faster than reads, therefore limiting the amount of processing
    required when new records are inserted.

- en: Essentially , the *embedded* part of an *embedded system* refers to the state
    of being embedded into a larger system. The system that has been embedded is a
    computer system of some description, which has one or more very specific functions
    in the overall system, rather than being a general-purpose component. This larger
    system can be digital, mechanical, or analog in nature, while the additional integrated
    digital circuitry tightly interacts with data from and to interfaces, sensors
    and memory to implement the actual system functionality.

    microprocessors, meaning a computer processor (central processing unit, or CPU)
    usually contained in a single **integrated circuit** (**IC**). The microprocessor
    comprises at least the **arithmetic logic unit** (**ALU**) and control circuitry,
    but logically also registers, and **input/output** (**I/O**) banks, in addition
    to more advanced features commonly tailored to a specific product category (wearables,

    4-bit, single-chip system. It was first made available for sale in 1974\. The
    original model had 1 KB of ROM, 64 x 4 bits of RAM, and 23 I/O pins. They could

    a DIP package. This type of MCU used mask-programmable ROM, meaning that you could
    not get a blank TMS 1000 chip and program it. Instead, you would have to send
    the debugged program to Texas Instruments to have it physically produced using
    a photolithography mask, resulting in a metallic bridge for each bit.

    are to be connected to an external oscillator circuit. Much like with discrete
    logic ICs, the **Init** pin is used to initialize the chip on power-up and has
    to be kept high for at least six cycles, whereas recent MCUs have integrated Power-On
    Reset (POR) and a reset pin that needs at most a discrete resistor and capacitor.

    series, with the 8048, 8035, and 8748 being the first models released in 1976\.
    The 8048 has 1 KB of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM. It is an 8-bit design with a Harvard
    architecture (split code/data memory), introducing a native word size of 8 bits
    and interrupt support (two single-level) and is compatible with 8080/8085 peripherals,
    making it a highly versatile MCU. The advantage of wider ALU and register word
    sizes is still perceivable today, where for example a 32 bit addition is sequentially
    executed on an 8 bit MCU as a series of 8 bit additions with carry.

    and a range of Korg and Roland analog synthesizers. While masked ROM (up to 2
    KB) was an option with the MCS-48 family, the 87P50 used an external ROM module
    for its programming, and the 8748 and 8749 featured up to 2 KB EPROM, which allowed
    for the MCU's internal programming to be altered repeatedly.

    within a 20-30 minute exposure to strong ultraviolet light. The same can be achieved
    in direct sunlight over the course of a few weeks. The erase cycle usually implies
    removing the package and putting it in the light tight erasing device. After this,
    the EPROM can be programmed anew. The specified data retention of an EPROM is
    about 10-20 years at 85°C, and because the degradation accelerates exponentially
    with temperature, statements of 100 years or more at room temperature are not
    uncommon (27C512A: 200 years).'

- en: Due to the expense of creating the quartz window and integrating it into the
    package, one-time programmable EPROMs were used for a while, which allow for the
    easy programming of an EPROM, but mounted the programmed die in an opaque package
    so that it could not be reprogrammed any more. Ultimately, EEPROMs became available
    in the early 1980s, which replaced EPROMs almost completely. EEPROMs can be rewritten
    about a million times before they begin to develop issues when retaining stored
    data. Their data retention performance is similar to that of EPROMs.

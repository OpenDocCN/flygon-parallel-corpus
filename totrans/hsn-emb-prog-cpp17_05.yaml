    small amounts of RAM, CPU power, and storage. This chapter deals with planning
    for and making efficient use of limited resources taking into account the wide
    range of currently available MCUs and **System-on-Chip** (**SoC**) solutions.

    type of MCU, it can seem like an overwhelming task to. As we saw in [Chapter 1](0ff8cac9-3155-45e1-af05-7005fc419dd6.xhtml), *What
    are Embedded Systems?*, there is a large number of MCUs to choose from, even if

    between 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit MCUs, or something as easy to quantify as clock
    speed, but these metrics are sometimes misleading and often don't lend themselves
    well to narrowing down the product selection. As it turns out, the parent categories
    are availability of sufficient I/O and the integrated peripherals to make the
    hardware happen in a lean and reliable way, as well as processing power tailored
    to the requirements faced at design-time and predicted to emerge throughout the
    product life-time.

    tools. For hobby and other noncommercial projects, one would primarily consider
    the strength of the community and the available free development tools, while
    in the context of commercial projects one would also look at the support one could

    Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) IEEE standard 1149.1 and easily recognized by signals
    frequently labeled TDI, TDO, TCK, TMS and TRST, defining the aptly-named Test
    Action Port (TAP). The larger standard has since been expanded up to 1149.8 and
    not all versions apply to digital logic, so we'll limit our scope to 1149.1 and
    a reduced pin count version described under 1149.7\. For now we just require that
    at least one of the full-featured JTAG, SWD and UPDI interfaces be supported.

    an active production phase of a few years, it's vital that we ensure the MCU availability
    (or that of compatible replacements) for at least that period. Reputable manufacturers
    provide product life cycle information as part of their supply chain management,
    with discontinuation notices being sent 1 to 2 years in advance, and recommendations
    for lifetime buys.

    powerful, and easy-to-use Arduino compatible boards, especially the popular ones
    designed around the AVR family of MCUs. Among these, the ATmega MCUs—the mega168/328,
    and in particular the mega1280/2560 variants—provide significant amounts of processing
    power, ROM, and RAM for both high-level functionality and the handling of data
    for input, control, and telemetry, as well as a differentiated but rich sets of
    peripherals and GPIO.

    to a more definitive variant with lower specifications and (hopefully) better
    BOM cost. As an example, the ATmega2560 "MEGA" board is shown as follows, and
    we will look at other boards in more detail later in this chapter as we work through
    a number of examples on how to develop for the AVR platform.

    boards and bread-boarded components will dwindle until one reaches the point where
    one starts working on the final **printed circuit board** (**PCB**) layout. This
    will go through a number of iterations as well, as issues get ironed out, last-minute
    features are added, and the system as a whole is tested and optimized.

- en: MCUs in such systems work on a physical level with the hardware, thus it is
    often a requirement to specify both hardware and software in tandem, if only because
    the software is so reliant on the hardware functionality. A common theme encountered
    in the industry is hardware modularity, either as small add-on PCBs with minimum
    added complexity, adding sensor or communication interfaces to devices such as
    temperature controllers and variable-frequency drives, or as full-fledged DIN
    rail modules connected to a common serial bus.

- en: The cutting beam is usually generated by a CO[2] laser, a type of gas laser
    that was invented in 1964\. The application of a high voltage causes current flow
    and thereby excitement of the gas molecules in the bore that make up the gain
    medium, ultimately resulting in the formation of a coherent beam of **long-wavelength
    infrared** (**LWIR**) or IR-C, light at a wavelength of 9.4 or 10.6 µm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One characteristic of LWIR is that it is strongly absorbed by a large number
    of materials, so that it can be used for engraving, cutting, and even surgery
    on tissues as the water in biological tissues efficiently absorbs the laser beam.
    This also makes it obvious why even brief exposure of one's skin to a CO[2] laser's
    beam is extremely dangerous.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the enclosure during normal operation, deactivating the laser power supply, and
    closing a beam shutter or preferably a combination of these measures when any
    of the interlocks is opened or any other safety condition is no longer satisfied.

    fumes that need to be continuously removed from the enclosure so as not to contaminate
    the optics and exit into the environment when the lid is opened.'

    itself, but due to the increase in code size and CPU requirements to handle cryptography
    with certificates depending on the security level chosen. We would also need a
    secure place to store the certificates which usually bumps up MCU specs.

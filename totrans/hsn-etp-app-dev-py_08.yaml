    the application, such as how we can make sure our application is secure, how well

    have been written. To produce any meaningful output, these individual components
    need to interact with each other in different possible ways based upon the type
    of input that has been provided. To have a complete check of the application code
    base, the components that make up the application not only need to be tested in

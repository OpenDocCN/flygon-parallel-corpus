- en: This book will help you learn about Eclipse MicroProfile, an open source specification
    for enterprise Java microservices that started back in 2016, along with its background
    and history, its value proposition to organizations and businesses, its community
    governance, the current Eclipse MicroProfile sub-projects (more are being added
    as the open source project evolves), its implementations, and its interoperability.
    It will also provide a peek into the future direction of Eclipse MicroProfile,
    a sample application in Red Hat's implementation of Eclipse MicroProfile in Thorntail,
    one of the runtimes provided by Red Hat Runtimes, and guidance and considerations
    for running Eclipse MicroProfile in hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud environments.
    This book will follow a step-by-step approach to help you understand the Eclipse
    MicroProfile project and its implementations in the market.

- en: Eclipse MicroProfile is a set of specifications for microservices written in
    the Java language. It is a project that is community-driven with many implementations
    in the market. The project, first announced in June 2016, continues to develop
    a set of common **Application Programming Interfaces** (**APIs**) for implementing
    Java microservices suitable for modern application development techniques, architectures,
    and environments. In this chapter, you will learn about the origin and importance
    of Eclipse MicroProfile.

    language that runs on your favorite operating system. Nowadays, there are a myriad
    of languages, specifications, frameworks, proprietary and open source software
    and tools, underlying deployment infrastructures, and development methodologies
    that programmers need to learn to develop modern applications. Development at
    IT organizations has become polyglot, that is, multiple programming languages
    are used depending on the needs of specific projects. In this age of the cloud,
    containers, microservices, reactive programming, 12-factor applications, serverless,
    MINI services, polyglot environments, and so on, developers now have the option
    to choose the right tool for their task, making them more effective and productive.

    the **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) have brought about the digital economy. While
    this has opened up new markets, it has also imposed new demands on businesses
    and their IT organizations, which are now required to not only support and maintain
    traditional workloads but also deliver new applications at a faster pace.

    within organizations in an attempt to tackle these new demands. One of these is
    microservices, specifically, Enterprise Java microservices, since Java is still

    In fact, since the invention of the first computer, increasing efficiency has
    always been in the minds of computer scientists. High-level programming languages,
    encapsulation, reusability, inheritance, event-driven design, SOA, microservices,
    machine learning, and AI, are all concepts that address the challenge of doing
    things faster. With each wave of new technology, the gearbox adds a new speed
    requirement to the evolution of how we develop and deliver software. The digital
    economy has added another high-speed gear to the gearbox.

    do they have to create, run, and support traditional-style applications, but also
    applications that conform to the new demands of the digital economy. They have
    to support both waterfall and DevOps processes, hybrid cloud infrastructures,
    and SOA and microservice architectures.

    technology have all been geared toward the implementation, delivery, and maintenance
    of traditional-style applications. Many organizations have already embarked on,
    or are starting, their journey of digital transformation, which addresses the
    challenges of the digital economy. This journey includes changes in technologies,
    frameworks, languages, and processes for the development, delivery, integration,
    and maintenance of applications.

    or a business technology strategy ([https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/Forrester-False-Promise-of-Bimodal-IT.pdf](https://go.forrester.com/wp-content/uploads/Forrester-False-Promise-of-Bimodal-IT.pdf)),
    the fact is that IT needs to deliver faster than ever before on the needs of the
    business, for both existing and new applications. This means IT needs to also
    speed up the maintenance and delivery of existing applications while exclusively
    adopting Agile methodologies for new applications. This does not preclude, however,
    the need to still use different development processes, release cycles, and support
    timelines to handle existing applications versus new applications, which is effectively
    the multi-speed nature of IT.

    of polyglot deployments using new approaches, such as microservices, containers,

    not governed by a single vendor. In addition, it receives contributions from developers
    and subject-matter experts across a spectrum of organizations, corporations, and
    individual contributors. The project is characterized by its innovation, speed,
    and agility via light processes and governance. The topics in this chapter will
    help you to understand the governance of the MicroProfile project, and you will
    discover how you can contribute to the MicroProfile project too.

    and evolving specifications in a collaborative manner.

- en: Eclipse MicroProfile, first and foremost, is an Eclipse project and it, therefore,
    follows Eclipse processes. This includes committer approvals, project releases,
    intellectual property safeguarding, license review processes, and more. However,
    the Eclipse Foundation is flexible enough for projects such as MicroProfile to
    offer some additional lightweight processes for multiple specifications to move
    forward in parallel with ways to communicate across and align specifications.
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of these lightweight processes is the Eclipse MicroProfile bi-weekly Hangout
    meeting/call (whose meeting URL is [https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/949859967](https://eclipse.zoom.us/j/949859967),
    and whose recordings can be found on the Eclipse MicroProfile YouTube channel
    at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Uqc8MYFDoCItFIGheMD_w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Uqc8MYFDoCItFIGheMD_w)),
    which is open to anybody in the community and serves as a forum where topics brought
    up by attendees are discussed and decisions are made, from sub-project statuses
    and release contents to release dates and sub-project creation approvals. It should
    be noted that MicroProfile is not a standards organization, although it can seem
    that way. MicroProfile was created by the community for the community, and it
    moves at the speed that the community determines as it innovates in its different
    sub-projects. MicroProfile defines specifications that encourage multiple implementations,
    much like a standards organization. However, MicroProfile truly operates as a
    fast-evolving open source project whose source code is specifications.

- en: The main means of community communication, discussion, and debate is the Eclipse
    MicroProfile Google Group ([https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/microprofile)).
    You can use your favorite web browser to read, post, answer, or start forum messages
    for any MicroProfile-related topic in the Google Group. You can also use the Group's
    email to start new forum messages. Anybody can start new forum threads to discuss
    topics, such as potential new functionality to be added to MicroProfile. After
    the community discusses a new idea at length in the forum and/or the MicroProfile
    Hangout call, and it's been determined that it is worth furthering the debate,
    the community decides to create a working group for this new idea, and a lead
    or a group of leads, who are usually subject-matter experts in the topic at hand,
    are designated to serve as its facilitators.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One important aspect to note is that the lead or leads of a working group (or
    sub-project for that matter) do not single-handedly shape or determine the evolution
    of a specification or what capabilities are included or not. They do not have
    the power of veto or a final say in the decisions made with respect to their specification.
    By their sharing of ideas, expertise, past experiences, analysis of existing technologies,
    and best practices, the working group will come up with their best proposal possible.
    In addition, all unresolved issues need to be discussed by the community and brought
    up in the bi-weekly Hangout meeting/call for further debate, if needed. Through
    discussion, collaboration, and feedback from the community, many points of view
    are analyzed, allowing the best option or options to bubble up to the top. The
    working group will establish a recurring weekly or bi-weekly meeting, which is
    entered in the MicroProfile Google Calendar ([https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gbnbc373ga40n0tvbl88nkc3r4%40group.calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gbnbc373ga40n0tvbl88nkc3r4%40group.calendar.google.com)).

    calls, and MicroProfile release dates.

- en: While anybody can attend these meetings, there's usually a core number of people
    that serve as the subject-matter experts who participate in these calls. After
    a few meetings, the working group decides whether or not the new functionality
    should be brought up to the MicroProfile Hangout call to discuss its proposal
    to become a MicroProfile sub-project.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the MicroProfile Hangout call, a sub-project proposal may be rejected or
    accepted. It should be said that by the time the sub-project proposal is brought
    to the MicroProfile Hangout call, most of the discussion of whether or not it
    should move forward will have taken place already, so the decision taken at the
    call should really be of no surprise to the sub-project working group. The rejection
    of a sub-project does not mean that it does not fulfill a specific developmental
    need, but rather an affirmation that its goals are not a good match to advance
    the MicroProfile specification, whose goal is the optimization of Enterprise Java
    for a microservices architecture.
  id: totrans-12

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'For example, if a sub-project proposal addresses a need that is unrelated to
    microservices, then the chances are that the sub-project proposal will not move
    forward as a MicroProfile sub-project. The acceptance of a sub-project means that
    it effectively addresses a need that enriches the specification toward its goal
    of optimizing Enterprise Java for a microservices architecture. It is at this
    moment that a sub-project becomes an official MicroProfile API. Once the sub-project
    becomes a MicroProfile API, then a determination is made as to whether it should
    be a standalone sub-project outside the umbrella or a sub-project included in
    the umbrella MicroProfile releases. A high-level flowchart of this process is
    as follows:'

    Major Eclipse MicroProfile releases, for example, from 1.x to 2.x, include major
    updates to MicroProfile APIs that may introduce breaking changes. Minor releases,
    that is point releases, include small API updates or new APIs that make the predetermined
    release date. Currently, the MicroProfile community release windows are in February,
    June, and November of every year for minor and/or major releases.

    released outside the umbrella release. For example, Eclipse MicroProfile Reactive
    Streams Operators 1.0, which we will cover in [Chapter 9](2bf742ea-ed02-4f2b-8e91-f7ae4c200e6f.xhtml),
    *Reactive Programming and Future Developments*, is a specification that was recently
    released outside the umbrella. So, why does MicroProfile allow specifications
    outside the umbrella? Well, the reason is that by releasing outside the umbrella
    first, it gives the community and end users an opportunity to utilize and test
    the new technology and, therefore, proving it in real applications before it can
    be considered for inclusion in the umbrella.

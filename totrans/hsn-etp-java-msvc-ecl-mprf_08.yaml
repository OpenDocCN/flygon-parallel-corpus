    Two of these, Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI and Eclipse MicroProfile REST Client,
    help with the API documentation for your microservices and provide an API for
    type-safe invocation on REST endpoints, respectively. OpenAPI simplifies the documentation
    for microservice endpoints and makes this metadata available for perusal by third-party
    developers. A type-safe REST client simplifies the marshalling and unmarshalling
    of objects to HTTP or JSON.

- en: The mobile force that fuels the digital economy led to the need for businesses
    to establish an omni-channel approach to development in order to optimize costs,
    increase efficiencies, and improve customer experience. A facilitator of this
    approach was APIs, which led to the API economy and concepts such as API-led or
    API-first development practices. In addition, the microservices architecture has
    become the architecture of choice for modern development. API-based (that is,
    RESTful) communication among microservices has been adopted as the *de facto*
    standard because it is a good fit for the *smart endpoints and dumb pipes*, *decentralized
    governance*, and *decentralized data management* characteristics of microservices.

    former provides a specification for generating OpenAPI-compliant documentation
    for your microservices, and the latter supplies a specification for calling REST
    endpoints in a type-safe manner. In this chapter, we covered the specific capabilities
    of these specifications, provided some example code, and supplied pointers on
    how to get further information about these specifications. You have learned the
    features and capabilities of the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI and Eclipse MicroProfile
    REST Client specifications, how to use their annotations and programmatic interfaces,
    and how you could incorporate them into your applications.

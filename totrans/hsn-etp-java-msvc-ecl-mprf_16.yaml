    Group and/or the MicroProfile Hangout call, and it's been determined that it is
    worth furthering the debate, the community decides to create a working group for
    this new idea, and a lead or a group of leads, who are usually subject-matter
    experts in the topic at hand, are designated to serve as its facilitators. The
    working group will establish a recurring weekly or bi-weekly meeting, which is
    entered in the MicroProfile Google Calendar. Anybody can attend these meetings,
    but there's usually a core number of people that serve as the subject-matter experts
    that participate in these calls. After a few meetings, the working group decides
    whether or not the new functionality should be brought up to the MicroProfile
    Hangout call to discuss its proposal to become a MicroProfile sub-project. At
    the MicroProfile Hangout call, a sub-project proposal may be rejected or accepted. The
    acceptance of a sub-project means that it effectively addresses a need that enriches
    the specification towards its goal of optimizing enterprise Java for a microservices
    architecture. It is at this moment, that a sub-project becomes an official MicroProfile
    API. Once the sub-project becomes a MicroProfile API, then a determination is

    to fulfill the same objective as with a single cloud environment to visualize
    the single end-to-end trace associated with a request as it passes through services
    within and across each cloud, but may face complications when dealing with different
    context propagation formats and storage of the tracing data in different formats
    per cloud. The first challenge is to ensure that a trace continues across different
    cloud environments. This is a problem because, at the time of writing, there is
    not widely adopted or standardized trace context format. Usually, each tracing
    system uses different headers and formats to propagate the tracing context. The
    second challenge, even in a homogenous tracing environment, is to visualize tracing
    data from multi-cloud environments. This can be problematic because tracing data
    in each cloud might be stored in different databases or in different formats.
    This can be overcome by replicating the data to a single unified storage or sending
    missing tracing data between systems on-demand with the appropriate data format
    adjustments.

- en: If you asked five professionals the meaning of financial modeling, you would
    probably get five different answers. The truth is that they would all be correct
    in their own context. This is inevitable since the boundaries for the use of financial
    modeling continue to be stretched almost daily, and new users want to define the
    discipline from their own perspective. In this chapter, you will learn the basic
    ingredients of a financial model and what my favorite definitions are. You will
    also learn about the different tools for financial modeling that currently exist
    in the industry, as well as those features of Excel that make it the ideal tool
    to use in order to handle the various needs of a financial model.

    most environmentally friendly option, but is usually a mixture of all these features. Inevitably,
    there is an inherent uncertainty in the situation, which makes it necessary to
    make assumptions based on past results. The most appropriate way to capture all
    the variables inherent in the situation or problem is to create a mathematical

- en: The preceding screenshot gives us an example of how you would lay out your assumptions
    for a loan repayment schedule model. The monthly repayment is calculated using
    Excel's `PMT` function. The tenure is 10 years, but repayment is monthly (12 repayment
    periods per year), giving a total number of periods of *(nper)() of 12 × 10 =
    120*. Note that the annual interest rate will have to be converted to a rate per
    period, which is `10%`/`12` (rate/periods), to give `0.83%` per month in our example. The
    `pv`is the loan amount. We also need to keep in mind that the actual loan amount
    is the cost of the asset less customer's contribution.

- en: '**Large datasets**: Excel struggles with very large data. After most actions,
    Excel recalculates all formulas included in your model. For most users, this happens
    so quickly that you don''t even notice. However, with large amounts of data and

    data from the internet and other sources. For example, financial statements from
    a company''s website, exchange rates from multiple sources, and more. This data
    comes in different formats with varying degrees of structure. Excel does a relatively
    good job of extracting data from these sources. However, it has to be done manually,
    and thus it is tedious and limited by the skill set of the user. Oracle BI, Tableau,

- en: '**Error in assumptions**: When building your model, you need to make a number
    of assumptions since you are making an educated guess as to what might happen
    in the future. As essential as these assumptions are, they are necessarily subjective.
    Different modelers faced with the same set of circumstances may come up with different
    sets of assumptions leading to quite different outcomes. This is why it is always
    necessary to test the accuracy of your model by substituting a range of alternative
    values for key assumptions and observe how this affects the model. This procedure,
    referred to as sensitivity and scenario analyses, is an essential part of modeling.
    These analyses can be done in Excel, but they are always limited in scope and
    are done manually. Alternative software can easily utilize the Monte Carlo simulation
    for different variables or sets of variables to supply a range of likely results
    as well as the probability that they will occur. The Monte Carlo simulation is
    a mathematical technique that substitutes a range of values for various assumptions,
    and then runs calculations over and over again. The procedure can involve tens
    of thousands of calculations until it eventually produces a distribution of possible
    outcomes. The distribution indicates the chance or probability of individual results

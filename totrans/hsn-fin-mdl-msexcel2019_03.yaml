    a template (a standard format) with some simple rules guiding how data is to be
    input and presented. In general, you will require at least six columns of figures,
    three each of historical and projected years, and another three or four columns
    for descriptive information. The template should enhance navigation and be easy
    to follow. The first major decision is whether to adopt a single worksheet or

    an indication of the multiple tabs required in this approach:'

    sheet, you know that everything on the balance sheet worksheet relates to the
    balance sheet alone. There is no ambiguous content on the worksheet. If you then
    need to modify or query the content of that worksheet, you can do so without having
    to consider whether or not you are affecting a statement other than the balance
    sheet.

    that each year is in the same column on each worksheet. So that, if the `Y05F`

    **J** on the profit and loss, cash flow, and all other worksheets.

    that you maintain a standard layout for all statements right from the outset.
    Any change to column width or attempts to insert or delete columns will affect
    all statements since they are stacked one on top of the other. An important part
    of this approach is the grouping of each statement. Excel allows you to group
    rows so that they can be collapsed and hidden or expanded and revealed by clicking
    the **–** or **+** that is displayed alongside the row labels when the group is
    created. The following screenshot is an example of the single worksheet approach:'

    will cause the cursor to jump down to cell **A25**, `Balance Sheet Assumptions`.
    Column **D** will be for the `Units` and column **E** for the first year of historical
    financials. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the years should retain the

    With historical data, we are interested in the balance sheet, profit and loss
    account, and cash flow statement. It is common, in the course of preparing financial
    statements, to have a number of initial drafts which may have content that will
    been superseded when the final statements are agreed. Ensure that the financials
    you are given are the final audited financial statements. The more information
    you have, the more accurate your projections. However, you must not get carried
    away, as too much information will make the model unnecessarily cumbersome. Generally,
    historical data is limited to five years, with another five years of projected
    financials. Try to get soft copies of the historical financials in Excel readable
    format, as this will significantly reduce the amount of time you will need to
    spend converting into your template format.

  zh: 一旦模板就位，下一步就是获取历史财务数据。在历史数据中，我们对资产负债表、损益表和现金流量表感兴趣。在准备财务报表的过程中，通常会有一些初始草稿，这些草稿在最终报表达成一致时可能已经过时。确保您收到的财务报表是最终经过审计的财务报表。您拥有的信息越多，您的预测就越准确。但是，您不应该过分，因为太多的信息会使模型变得不必要地繁琐。通常，历史数据限制在五年内，再有五年的预测财务数据。尽量获取Excel可读格式的历史财务数据软拷贝，因为这将大大减少您需要花费的时间将其转换为模板格式。
- en: Inevitably, you will need to tidy up the data to bring formatting and arrangement
    in line with your model template and other anomalies. The actual figures from
    the historical financials will not change as you create your model; however, more
    often than not, you would have obtained the financials from a source that works
    with different preferences and priorities to yours. Moreover, the financials were
    not prepared with you and your financial model in mind. Imported data is therefore
    riddled with formatting or presentation anomalies, which make it difficult and
    sometimes impossible to utilize some Excel tools and shortcuts. This makes it
    necessary to retype some or all of the financials.

    the `Balance Check` is now red and `FALSE` for the projected years. This is because
    our balance sheet and profit and loss account are not yet complete. We have projected
    growth for most items, but there are certain items that require specific treatment,
    CapEx, depreciation, loans, and interest.

    all transactions carried out during the period under review. This fact is captured
    in the cash flow statement, which considers the inflows and outflows of cash.

    from the balance sheet and profit and loss account. The statement shows, separately,
    cash flow from operations, cash flow from investing activities, and cash flow
    from financing activities. You would expect cash generated from operations to
    be regularly greater than net income. If the reverse is the case, you would want
    to know why there is a delay in converting income into cash. The section on investing
    activities shows the movement in long term assets, such as long-term investments
    and property, plant, and equipment.

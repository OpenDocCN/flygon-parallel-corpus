  zh: 现金流量表简介
- en: Profit and loss accounts are different from the cash flow statement in that
    they do not wait for the cash implications of a transaction to be settled before
    the transaction is recognized. For example, if you make a sale of N100,000 and
    the customer has received the goods or services but has not yet paid, there is
    no cash movement.
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 损益表与现金流量表不同之处在于，它们不会等待交易的现金影响在交易确认之前解决。例如，如果您销售了10万纳伊拉的商品或服务，客户已经收到了货物或服务，但尚未付款，那么就没有现金流动。
- en: However, both you and the customer recognize that a sale has been made—indeed,
    ownership and custody of the goods have been transferred, so the profit and loss
    account will record this as a credit sale, increasing turnover by N100,000, and
    to complete the double entry, a receivable is created under that customer's name
    to signify that they owe you N100,000\. This is the accrual basis of accounting,
    which says that income should be recorded in the period in which it is earned,
    and expenses should be matched with the income they have helped generate.
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而，您和客户都认识到已经发生了销售——实际上，货物的所有权和保管权已经转移，因此损益表将把这笔交易记录为信用销售，将营业额增加10万纳伊拉，并为了完成双重输入，在该客户的名下创建应收账款，表示他们欠您10万纳伊拉。这是会计的权责基础，它规定收入应在其获得的期间记录，支出应与其帮助产生的收入相匹配。
- en: This permeates throughout accounts, affecting things such as rent paid in advance
    (only the rent for this year should go through the profit and loss accounts);
    electricity used but the bill has not yet arrived (charge the electricity in the
    profit and loss accounts); and purchases must be adjusted by opening and closing
    stock so that only the cost of goods sold is reflected in the profit and loss
    account.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这在整个账户中都有影响，影响诸如预付的租金（只有今年的租金应该通过损益表）；用电但账单尚未到达（在损益表中计入电费）；采购必须通过期初和期末库存进行调整，以便只有销售成本反映在损益表中。
- en: In all of these examples, the actual cash flow will differ from the amount included
    in the profit and loss account. This makes good economic sense and is essential
    in order to arrive at the true profit or loss for each period. However, as quoted
    earlier, turnover is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash is reality. No matter
    how much profit a company is making, if it is not backed up by cash, sooner or
    later the company will go bust. This is why the cash flow statement is so important.
  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在所有这些例子中，实际现金流将与损益表中包含的金额不同。这在经济上是有道理的，并且是为了得出每个期间的真实利润或损失而是必不可少的。然而，正如前面引用的那样，营业额是虚荣，利润是理智，但现金是现实。无论公司赚取多少利润，如果没有现金支持，公司迟早会破产。这就是现金流量表如此重要的原因。

- en: In assembling financial statements, the cash flow statement is usually prepared
    from the balance sheet and profit and loss account. The net inflow or outflow
    of cash is then added to or subtracted from the opening balance of cash to arrive
    at the closing balance of cash and cash equivalents, which should agree with the
    corresponding figure on the balance sheet. For the forecast years, there is no
    cash figure on the balance sheet, so we need to take advantage of this balance
    sheet-cash flow relationship to project a figure for cash.

- en: The obvious candidate for this is depreciation. The relevant cash flow occurs
    at the time the asset is purchased. However, we don't charge the total cost to
    the profit and loss account all at once; the correct accounting treatment is to
    allocate the original cost over the useful life of the asset.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This periodic allocation of cost is called **depreciation** and clearly does
    not involve the movement of cash. Since it has been deducted as an expense in
    arriving at our profit, we need to add it back to the PAT, as shown in the preceding
    screenshot. We also add back interest charged to PAT. Although this is cash flow,
    it is the cost of debt finance, and hence, is more appropriately treated under
    financing activities.

    In simple terms, taking our previous example, we have recorded a sale of N100,000,
    increasing our profit by that amount even though no cash was received. This section
    looks at the corresponding increase in accounts receivable of N100,000 and treats
    it as an outflow to be deducted before arriving at cash flow from operating activities,
    hence reversing the inflow recorded from the credit sale.

    equivalent under current assets. However, it is important to note that the balance
    could be negative, in which case, it should be reflected as an overdraft under

    charge in the profit and loss account, which changes the PAT. Since the PAT is
    linked to the cash flow statement, this will also result in a change in the closing

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to create our cash flow statement using various
    functions in Excel. We learned how to factor in various elements, such as items
    not involving cash movement, cash flow from various activities such as investment
    and finance, and so on. We also learned how to balance the sheet so that everything
    is accurate. We also understood how to troubleshoot any errors that might occur
    here. Finally, we created a sample cash flow statement for a specific scenario.

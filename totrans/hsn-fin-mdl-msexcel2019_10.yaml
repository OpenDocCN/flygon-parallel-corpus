- en: Profit and loss accounts are different from the cash flow statement in that
    they do not wait for the cash implications of a transaction to be settled before
    the transaction is recognized. For example, if you make a sale of N100,000 and
    the customer has received the goods or services but has not yet paid, there is
    no cash movement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, both you and the customer recognize that a sale has been made—indeed,
    ownership and custody of the goods have been transferred, so the profit and loss
    account will record this as a credit sale, increasing turnover by N100,000, and
    to complete the double entry, a receivable is created under that customer's name
    to signify that they owe you N100,000\. This is the accrual basis of accounting,
    which says that income should be recorded in the period in which it is earned,
    and expenses should be matched with the income they have helped generate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This permeates throughout accounts, affecting things such as rent paid in advance
    (only the rent for this year should go through the profit and loss accounts);
    electricity used but the bill has not yet arrived (charge the electricity in the
    profit and loss accounts); and purchases must be adjusted by opening and closing
    stock so that only the cost of goods sold is reflected in the profit and loss
    account.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In all of these examples, the actual cash flow will differ from the amount included
    in the profit and loss account. This makes good economic sense and is essential
    in order to arrive at the true profit or loss for each period. However, as quoted
    earlier, turnover is vanity, profit is sanity, but cash is reality. No matter
    how much profit a company is making, if it is not backed up by cash, sooner or
    later the company will go bust. This is why the cash flow statement is so important.

    from the balance sheet and profit and loss account. The net inflow or outflow
    of cash is then added to or subtracted from the opening balance of cash to arrive
    at the closing balance of cash and cash equivalents, which should agree with the
    corresponding figure on the balance sheet. For the forecast years, there is no
    cash figure on the balance sheet, so we need to take advantage of this balance
    sheet-cash flow relationship to project a figure for cash.

    at the time the asset is purchased. However, we don't charge the total cost to
    the profit and loss account all at once; the correct accounting treatment is to
    allocate the original cost over the useful life of the asset.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This periodic allocation of cost is called **depreciation** and clearly does
    not involve the movement of cash. Since it has been deducted as an expense in
    arriving at our profit, we need to add it back to the PAT, as shown in the preceding
    screenshot. We also add back interest charged to PAT. Although this is cash flow,
    it is the cost of debt finance, and hence, is more appropriately treated under
    financing activities.

    In simple terms, taking our previous example, we have recorded a sale of N100,000,
    increasing our profit by that amount even though no cash was received. This section
    looks at the corresponding increase in accounts receivable of N100,000 and treats
    it as an outflow to be deducted before arriving at cash flow from operating activities,
    hence reversing the inflow recorded from the credit sale.

    equivalent under current assets. However, it is important to note that the balance
    could be negative, in which case, it should be reflected as an overdraft under
    current liabilities. Since you don't know which it is going to be, especially
    as it may change as a result of subsequent modifications, you need to build your
    model in such a way that the cash balance is posted to cash and cash equivalents
    if it is positive and to overdraft if it is negative.

    (one that results in a true or false answer), the first thing that springs to
    mind is the `IF` statement. For example, say the cursor is in cell **J35**, cash
    and cash equivalents, and you wish to relate this to the calculated cash balance
    from the cash flow statement in cell **J86**.

    statement, you would type `=IF(J86>0,J86,"")`. This states that if the cash balance

    leave the cell blank.

    cell blank; otherwise, change the cash balance sign from negative to positive
    and put it in cell **J45**.

    error because you have included the answer cell, **A5**, in your sum range. In
    the general scheme of things, a company would invest any surplus cash to earn
    interest. On the other hand, when cash is in overdraft, it will incur interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we wanted to expand our model to include this scenario, we would need to
    extend our cash flow statement to include interest earned or charged on the cash
    balance. This interest is then subtracted from or added to the existing interest
    charge in the profit and loss account, which changes the PAT. Since the PAT is
    linked to the cash flow statement, this will also result in a change in the closing
    cash balance, which will affect the interest earned or charged on that balance,
    and the cycle continues, creating a circular reference.

    the closing cash balance of the cash flow statement gets smaller and smaller and

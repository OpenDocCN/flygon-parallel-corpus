    order to reduce the effects of this subjectivity as much as possible, you will
    need to adopt certain procedures, some of which we have already mentioned, and
    carry out certain tests designed to highlight the most volatile assumptions and
    pay direct attention to those inputs to which the model is most sensitive.

- en: The `RAND` function generates a random number between 0 and 1\. Each time Excel
    performs a calculation in this or another cell, the function recalculates, and
    another random number will be regenerated. The number, `0.83751`, translates to
    an `83.75%` chance of that value occurring.

    from the peak, the less likely it is for that value to occur. The peak represents
    the mean of all the values and is the most likely value of the variable. From
    the graph, you could select a value from the X-axis, the horizontal axis, and
    then trace a vertical line upward. The point at which it hits the curve gives
    the probability of that value occurring.

    learned how to display our results in a chart and to interpret them meaningfully.

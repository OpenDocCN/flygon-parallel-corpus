    backend and the frontend. That sounds like quite a challenging task, but if you
    focus on the right things and don't try to master everything, it is possible.
    Nowadays, the technology stack available is huge and you might often wonder what
    you should learn next. There are multiple factors that might give you some hints
    about where to go next. One way is to browse job opportunities and see which technologies
    companies are looking for.

    is used for frontend development, it can also be used in the backend with Node.js.
    That is the benefit with Node.js; you can use one programming language in the
    frontend and the backend. Other popular languages for backend development are
    Java, C#, Python, and PHP. All these languages also have good backend frameworks
    you can use.

    The database can be either a SQL or NoSQL database, and it is good to know both
    options. You should also know how performance can be optimized with the database
    you are using and the queries you are executing.

    more efficient. Here, we just mention some tools that might be useful for you.
    Gulp.js is an open source JavaScript toolkit to automate your tasks in the development
    process. Grunt is similar to the JavaScript task runner, which you can use to
    automate your process. Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler that creates static
    assets from your dependencies. create-react-app, which we used in previous chapters,
    actually uses Webpack under the hood.

- en: Coding conventions are guidelines that describe how the code should be written
    in a specific programming language. It makes code more readable and easier to
    maintain. Naming conventions define how variables, methods, and more should be
    named. Naming is really important because that helps developers understand the
    purpose of a certain unit in the program. The layout convention defines how the
    structure of the source code should look, for example, indenting and usage of
    spaces. The commenting convention defines how the source code should be commented.
    Quite often it is good to use some standardized ways for the commenting, such
    as Javadoc with Java.

    the tools you use will depend on the process and the technologies you're using.

- en: When starting to develop an application, one of the first things to decide is
    which technologies (programming language, frameworks, databases, and so on) you
    should use. Quite often, it feels safe to select technologies that you have always
    used, but that's not always the optimal choice. The application itself normally
    makes some limitations to the technologies that you can use. For example, if you
    have to create a mobile application, there are several technologies that you can
    use. But if you have to develop a similar application that you have made many
    times, it might be wiser to use technologies that you already know well.

- en: A common good practice is to minimize the amount of coding. This is really wise
    because it makes code maintenance and testing much easier. **DRY** (**Don't Repeat
    Yourself**) is a common principle in software development. The basic idea of DRY
    is to reduce the amount of code by avoiding repetitions in the code. It is always
    good practice to split your source code into smaller components because smaller
    units are always easier to manage. Of course, the optimum structure depends on
    the programming language you are using. One good statement is also **Keep it Simple,
    Stupid** (**KISS**) that should guide you in the right direction.

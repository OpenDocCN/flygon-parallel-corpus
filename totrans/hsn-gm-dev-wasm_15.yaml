    SDL can be used to render the user interface for the game while OpenGL renders
    the game objects. This chapter will deviate from many of the earlier chapters
    in that we will not be mixing SDL and OpenGL directly in the game we have been
    writing. Updating the game to support an OpenGL 2D rendering engine would require
    a complete redesign of the game up to this point. However, I would like to provide
    a chapter for those interested in creating a more advanced 2D rendering engine
    to get their feet wet with combining OpenGL and SDL and writing shaders for that

    or OpenGL ES 3.0 by mapping those calls to WebGL or WebGL 2 calls, respectively.
    Because of this, Emscripten only supports a subset of the OpenGL ES commands that
    correspond to the commands available inside of the WebGL library you use. For
    instance, if you would like to use OpenGL ES 3.0, you will need to include WebGL
    2 when compiling by passing the `-s USE_WEBGL2=1` parameter to the Emscripten
    compiler. In this chapter, we will be using OpenGL ES 2.0 in combination with
    SDL to render sprites using shaders, and later we will be using SDL to render
    an icon that represents the location of a light source in our application. SDL
    provides many features that are absent from OpenGL, such as an audio library,
    an image loading library, and mouse and keyboard input libraries. In many ways,
    SDL is better suited to rendering the game's user interface as it renders objects
    to screen coordinates instead of to the OpenGL clip space. Behind the scenes,
    the WebAssembly version of SDL is also using the Emscripten OpenGL ES implementation,
    which relies on WebGL. So, having a better understanding of WebAssembly's OpenGL
    implementation can help us to take our game development skills to the next level,
    even if we will not be using those skills in the game we have developed for this
    book.

    *HTML5 and WebAssembly*. Shaders are a critical part of modern 3D graphics rendering.
    Back in the early days of computer and video games, graphics were all 2D, and
    how fast graphics could render was a function of how fast the system could move
    pixels from one data buffer to another. This process is called *blitting*. One
    significant advance in these early days came when Nintendo added a **Picture Processing
    Unit** (**PPU**) to their Nintendo Entertainment System. This was an early piece
    of hardware that was designed to speed up graphics processing by moving pixels
    without using the game system's CPU. The Commodore Amiga was also a pioneer in
    these early 2D graphics coprocessors, and by the mid-1990s, hardware for blitting
    became a standard in the computer industry. In 1996, games such as Quake began
    to create a demand for consumer 3D graphics processing, and early graphics cards
    began to provide GPUs that had fixed function pipelines. This allowed applications
    to load geometry data and execute non-programmable texturing and lighting functions
    on that geometry. In the early 2000s, Nvidia introduced the GeForce 3\. This was
    the first GPU that supported a programmable pipeline. Eventually, these programmable
    pipeline GPUs began to standardize around a *unified shader model*, which allows
    programmers to write in a shading language such as GLSL for all graphics cards
    that support that language.

    language called GLSL ES. This shader language happens to work with WebGL and so
    is supported by the version of OpenGL ES that has been ported to WebAssembly.
    The code we are writing will run on both GLSL ES 1.0 and 3.0, which are the two
    versions of GLSL ES supported by WebAssembly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are wondering why there is no support for GLSL ES 2.0, it's because it
    doesn't exist. OpenGL ES 1.0 used a fixed function pipeline and so it had no shader
    language associated with it. When the Khronos Group created OpenGL ES 2.0, they
    created GLSL ES 1.0 as the shader language to go with it. When they released OpenGL
    ES 3.0, they decided that they wanted the version number of the shader language
    to be the same number as the API. Therefore, all the new versions of OpenGL ES
    will come with a version of GLSL that bears the same version number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'GLSL is a language that is very similar to C. Each shader has a `main` function
    that is its entry point. GLSL ES 2.0 only supports two shader types: *vertex shaders*
    and *fragment shaders*. The execution of these shaders is highly parallel. If
    you are used to thinking along single—threaded lines, you will need to reorder
    your brain. Shaders are frequently processing thousands of vertices and pixels
    at the same time.'

    *Introduction to WebGL*. A vertex is a point in space, and a collection of vertices
    define the geometry that our graphics card uses to render to the screen. A fragment
    is a pixel candidate. Multiple fragments usually go into determining the pixel
    output.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each vertex of the geometry that's passed to a vertex shader is processed by
    that shader. Values are then passed using a *varying variable* to a large number
    of threads that are processing individual pixels through a fragment shader. The
    fragment shader receives a value that is interpolated between the output of more
    than one of the vertex shaders. A fragment shader's output is a *fragment*, which
    is a pixel candidate. Not all fragments become pixels. Some fragments are dropped,
    which means they won't render at all. Other fragments are blended to form a completely
    different pixel color. We created one vertex and one fragment shader in [Chapter
    3](dd4517c5-291a-49f5-9c7d-4070bb1fd062.xhtml), *Introduction to WebGL*, for our
    WebGL application. Let's walk through converting that application into an OpenGL/WebAssembly
    app. Once we have a working application, we can further discuss shaders and new
    ways we can write those shaders to improve our 2D WebAssembly game.

    of this app. It looks a little different in C because JavaScript can use a multiline
    string that makes reading the code a little more clear. Like in the WebGL version,
    we use the precision call to set the floating-point precision to medium. We set
    up attributes to receive the position and UV texture coordinate data as vectors.
    We will pass in these vectors using a vertex buffer object. We define a uniform
    translate variable that will be the same value used for all vertices, which in
    general is not the way we would do this for a game, but will work just fine for
    this app. Finally, we define a varying `v_texcoord` variable. This variable will
    represent the texture coordinate value we pass from the vertex shader into the
    fragment shader. The `main()` function in this vertex shader is very simple. It
    adds the `u_translate` uniform variable translation value that's passed into the
    vertex shader to the attribute position of the vertex passed in via `a_position`,
    to get the final vertex position we set using the `gl_Position` variable. After
    that, we pass the texture coordinate of the vertex to the fragment shader by setting
    the `v_texcoord` varying variable to `a_texcoord`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After defining our vertex shader, we create the string that defines our fragment
    shader. The fragment shader receives an interpolated version of `v_texcoord`,
    which is the varying variable that's passed out of our vertex shader. You will
    need to put on your parallel processing hat for a moment to understand how this
    works. When the GPU is processing our vertex shader and fragment shader, it is
    not doing this one at a time, but is likely processing thousands of vertices and
    fragments at once. The fragment shader is also not receiving the output from a
    single one of these threads, but a value that is mixed from more than one of the
    vertices that are currently being processed.

- en: For example, if your vertex shader has a varying variable as output called X,
    and your fragment is halfway between a vertex where X is 0 and a vertex where
    X is 10, then the value in the varying variable coming into your fragment will
    be 5\. This is because 5 is halfway between the two vertex values of 0 and 10\.
    Likewise, if the fragment is 30% of the way between your two points, the value
    in X will be 3.

    pixel color. The last variable is a uniform variable of type `sampler2D`. This
    is a block of memory where we have loaded our texture. The only thing that the
    main function of this fragment shader does is use the built-in `texture2D` function
    to grab a pixel color out of our texture using the texture coordinates we passed
    into the fragment shader.

    variables are of type `GLuint`. A `GLuint` is an unsigned integer, and using the
    `GLuint` type is just an OpenGL type. Seeing `GLuint` instead of `unsigned int`
    is a nice way to give someone reading your code a hint that you are using this
    variable to interact with OpenGL. The program variable will eventually hold a
    reference to a program that will be defined by your shaders, and the texture variable
    will hold a reference to a texture that's been loaded into the GPU. After the
    references to program and texture, we have two variables that will be used to
    reference shader program attributes. The `a_texcoord_location` variable will be
    a reference to the `a_texcoord` shader attribute, and the `a_position_location`
    variable will be a reference to the `a_position` shader attribute value. The attribute
    references are followed up by two uniform variable references. If you are wondering
    what the difference between a uniform and attribute variable is, a uniform variable
    remains the same value for all vertices, whereas an attribute variable is vertex-specific.
    Finally, we have a reference to our vertex texture buffer in the `vertex_texture_buffer`

    to each specific attribute is located in our vertex buffer. We filled our vertex
    buffer with 32-bit floating point variables. The first call to `glVertexAttribPointer`
    sets the location of the values assigned to the `a_position` attribute using the
    reference variable we created in `a_position_location`. We then pass in the number
    of values we use for this attribute. In the case of position, we pass in an `x`

    buffer is using four floating-point values, we pass in `4 * sizeof( float )` for
    our stride. Finally, the last value we pass in is the offset in bytes to the data
    we are using to populate this attribute. For the `a_position` attribute, this
    value is `0` because the position comes at the beginning. For the `a_texcoord`

    a second texture and a time uniform variable. We will pass that variable into

    `u_texture` and `u_glow` using the built-in `texture2D` function. This time, instead
    of storing a value from the texture directly into `gl_FragColor`, we save those
    two values into `vec4` variables called `tex` and `glow`. We are going to be adding
    those two values together, so to keep things from getting too bright everywhere,
    we multiply the `rgb` (red green and blue) values in our `glow` sample color by
    the alpha channel. After that, we multiply all the values in our `glow` color

    Tuong Phong at the University of Utah in 1975, but it was not until the late 1990s
    that desktop computers became fast enough to implement the model in games. Since
    then, the lighting model has become the standard for 3D game development. It combines
    ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to render geometry. We won't be able to
    implement a proper version of the lighting model because we aren't writing a 3D
    game. However, we can implement an approximation of the model by using 2D sprites
    and normal maps to go along with those sprites.

    lighting is not created with a shader, but is included in the sprite by the artist
    that created it. In a platformer game, for instance, the artist may assume that
    there is a light source that comes from above the game objects. The artist would
    design the game objects to have a kind of diffuse lighting by changing the colors
    of the pixels in the artwork. For many 2D games, this will work perfectly fine.

    relatively low polygon counts in 3D games. The idea is that rather than creating
    a surface with a huge number of polygons, a game engine could use a low polygon
    model that had a normal map where each pixel in the normal map would contain the
    x, y, and z values of a normal using the red, green, and blue colors of the image.
    Inside of a shader, we could then sample the normal map texture in the same way
    we sample other texture maps. However, we could use the normal data to help us
    calculate the lighting effects on our sprites. If, in our game, we wanted our
    spaceships to always be lit relative to the star in the center of the gameplay
    area, we could create a normal map for our spaceships and create a light source

    source. We use the `static int mouse_down` variable to track whether or not the
    user pressed the mouse button. If the user pressed the mouse button, we would
    call `SDL_GetMouseState` to retrieve the `light_x` and `light_y` variables, which

    back in [Chapter 3](dd4517c5-291a-49f5-9c7d-4070bb1fd062.xhtml), *Introduction
    to WebGL*, when we built a WebGL app. It is helpful to have an understanding of
    WebGL when you are using OpenGL for WebAssembly because each call to OpenGL from
    WebAssembly is internally calling the corresponding WebGL functions. We started
    by rebuilding that WebGL app using a combination of OpenGL ES and SDL in C++ and
    compiled it to WebAssembly. We then learned how we could use OpenGL and shaders
    to mix different textures in interesting ways. We used this knowledge to create
    a pulsing glow around the spaceship's engines. Finally, we discussed 3D lighting
    and normal maps, and then developed a 2D lighting model and created an app that
    allows us to light a simple circle with that lighting model. This app demonstrates
    the possibilities in 2D lighting by allowing us to move our light around a 2D
    circle with a normal map, which is used to give that 2D surface the appearance
    of depth.

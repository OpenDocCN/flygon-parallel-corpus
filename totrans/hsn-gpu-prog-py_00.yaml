- en: Greetings and salutations! This text is an introductory guide to GPU programming
    with Python and CUDA. **GPU** may stand for **Graphics Programming Unit**, but
    we should be clear that this book is *not* about graphics programming—it is essentially
    an introduction to **General-Purpose GPU Programming**, or **GPGPU** **Programming**
    for short. Over the last decade, it has become clear that GPUs are well suited
    for computations besides rendering graphics, particularly for parallel computations
    that require a great deal of computational throughput. To this end, NVIDIA released
    the CUDA Toolkit, which has made the world of GPGPU programming all the more accessible
    to just about anyone with some C programming knowledge.

- en: The aim of *Hands-On GPU Programming with Python and CUDA* is to get you started
    in the world of GPGPU programming as quickly as possible. We have strived to come
    up with fun and interesting examples and exercises for each chapter; in particular,
    we encourage you to type in these examples and run them from your favorite Python
    environment as you go along (Spyder, Jupyter, and PyCharm are all suitable choices).
    This way, you will eventually learn all of the requisite functions and commands,
    as well as gain an intuition of how a GPGPU program should be written.

- en: Initially, GPGPU parallel programming seems very complex and daunting, especially
    if you've only done CPU programming in the past. There are so many new concepts
    and conventions you have to learn that it may seem like you're starting all over
    again at zero. During these times, you'll have to have some faith that your efforts
    to learn this field are not for naught. With a little bit of initiative and discipline,
    this subject will seem like second nature to you by the time you reach the end
    of the text.

- en: This book is aimed at one person in particular—that is, myself in the year 2014,
    when I was trying to develop a GPU-based simulation for my doctoral studies in
    math. I was poring over multiple books and manuals on GPU programming, trying
    to make the slightest sense of the field; most texts seemed happy to throw an
    endless parade of hardware schematics and buzzwords at the reader on every page,
    while the actual *programming* took a back seat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is primarily aimed at those who want to actually *do* *GPU programming*,
    but without getting bogged down with gritty technical details and hardware schematics.
    We will program the GPU in proper C/C++ (CUDA C) in this text, but we will write
    it *inline* within Python code by way of the PyCUDA module. PyCUDA allows us to
    only write the necessary low-level GPU code that we need, while it automatically
    handles all of the redundancies of compiling, linking, and launching code onto
    a GPU for us.

    which are parallel functions that are launched on the GPU. We will see how to
    write CUDA device functions ("serial" functions called directly by CUDA kernels),
    and learn about CUDA''s abstract grid/block structure and the role it plays in
    launching kernels.'

    that allows us to launch and synchronize many kernels onto a GPU concurrently.

    and use CUDA Contexts.'

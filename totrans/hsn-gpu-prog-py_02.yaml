    under both Windows and Linux. In both cases, there are several steps we will have
    to take. We will proceed through these steps one-by-one, noting any differences
    between Linux and Windows as we proceed. You should, of course, feel free to skip

    3.x users can make use of this book, but should be aware of the differences between
    Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. Some of the examples in this have been tested on using

    modules needed for this text, and uses fast pre-optimized NumPy/SciPy packages
    that make use of Intel's **Math Kernel Library** (**MKL**). (The default Linux

    The `.run` file installs outside of your system's **Advanced Package Tool **(**APT**)

    Python environment variables; the standard path is `Anaconda2\Scripts\activate.bat`.
    We have to further indicate where the Anaconda libraries are with an argument
    to this script. In my case, the second line in my launch script would be `call
    "C:\Users\%username%\Anaconda2\Scripts\activate.bat" C:\Users\%username%\Anaconda2`.

    or command-line prompt—you prefer to program in, which will inherit all of the
    necessary environment and system variables the prior two scripts will set up.
    If you prefer the old standard DOS-style Command Prompt, this line should just
    be `cmd`. If you like to work from PowerShell, change this to `powershell`. It
    will be necessary to use the command line in some cases, particularly for accessing
    the command line `pip` and `conda` for updating your Python library.

- en: Setting up your Python environment for GPU programming can be a very delicate
    process. The Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution is suggested for both Windows and
    Linux users for the purposes of this text. First, we should ensure that we have
    the correct hardware for GPU programming; generally speaking, a 64-bit Windows
    or Linux PC with 4 gigabytes of RAM and any entry-level NVIDIA GPU from 2016 or
    later will be sufficient for our ends. Windows users should be careful in using
    a version of Visual Studio that works well with both the CUDA Toolkit and Anaconda
    (such as VS 2015), while Linux users should be particularly careful in the installation
    of their GPU drivers, and set up the appropriate environment variables in their
    `.bashrc` file. Furthermore, Windows users should create an appropriate launch
    script that will set up their environment for GPU programming and should use a
    pre-compiled wheel file for the installation of the PyCUDA library.

- en: Now, with our programming environment set up and in place, we will spend the
    next chapter learning the very basics of GPU programming. We will see how to write
    and read data to and from the GPU's memory, and how to write some very simple
    *elementwise* GPU functions in CUDA C. (If you have seen the classic 1980's film
    *The Karate Kid*, then you might think of the following chapter as the "wax on,
    wax off" of GPU programming.)

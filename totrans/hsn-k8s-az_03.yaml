    Thankfully, all the major cloud providers, such as Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud
    Platform (GCP), facilitate installing and maintaining clusters. In this chapter,
    you will navigate through the Azure portal, launch your own cluster, and run a
    sample application. All of this will be accomplished from your browser.

    Note that Kubernetes took care of tasks such as connecting the front end and the
    back end, and exposing it to the outside world, as well as providing storage for
    the services.

    portal to perform all the functions required to deploy an AKS cluster. You used
    the free trial on Azure to your advantage to learn the ins and outs of AKS and
    other Azure services. You launched your own AKS cluster with the ability to customize
    configurations if required using the Azure portal.

    This is important for all the upcoming sections, where you will be doing more
    than launching simple applications. Finally, you launched a publicly accessible
    service. The skeleton of this application is the same as for the complex applications
    that you will be launching in later chapters.

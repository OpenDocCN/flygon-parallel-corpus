- en: In computing, virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual form of a device
    or a resource, such as a server, storage device, network, or even an operating
    system. The concept of virtualization came into the picture when IBM developed
    its time-sharing solutions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. **Time-sharing**
    refers to the sharing of computer resources between a large group of users, increasing
    the productivity of users and eliminating the need to purchase a computer for
    each user. This was the beginning of a revolution in computer technology where
    the cost of purchasing new computers reduced significantly and it became possible
    for organizations to utilize the under-utilized computer resources they already
    had.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, this type of virtualization has evolved into container-based virtualization.
    Virtual machines have their own operating system, which is virtualized on top
    of a physical server; on the other hand, containers on one machine (either physical
    or virtual) all share the same underlying operating system. We will talk more
    about containers in *Chapter 9, Container Virtualization in Azure*.

    virtualization, was introduced by companies such as VMware. In their product,
    VMware Workstation, they added a layer on top of an existing operating system
    that provided a set of standard hardware and built-in software instead of physical
    elements to run a virtual machine. This layer became known as a **hypervisor**.
    Later, they built their own operating system, which specialized in running virtual
    machines: VMware ESXi (formerly known as ESX).'

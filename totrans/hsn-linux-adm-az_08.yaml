    This is nice for labs and very small environments, but if you have to manage bigger
    environments, this is a very time-consuming and even boring job. It's also very
    easy to make mistakes and forget things, such as the slight differences between
    VMs, not to mention the concomitant stability and security risks. For example,
    choosing the wrong version during deployment will result in consistency issues,
    and performing an upgrade later is a tedious process.

- en: In musical terms, orchestration is the study of how to write music for an orchestra.
    You have to understand each instrument and know what sounds they can make. Then,
    you can start writing the music; to do this, you have to understand how the instruments
    sound together. Most of the time, you start with a single instrument, for instance,
    a piano. After that, you scale up to include the other instruments. Hopefully,
    the result will be a masterpiece and the members of the orchestra will be able
    to start playing it. It's not that important how the members start, but, in the
    end, the conductor makes sure that the results count.

    of the environment is written in software. Yes, we know, at the end of the line,
    there is still a datacenter with many hardware components, but as a cloud user,
    you don't care about that. Everything you need is written in software and has
    APIs to talk to. So, it's not only possible to automate the deployment of your
    Linux workloads, but you can automate and orchestrate the configuration of the
    Linux operating system and the installation and configuration of applications
    and keep everything up to date. You can also use orchestration tools to configure
    Azure resources, and it's even possible to create Linux VMs using these tools.

    is the better approach in a cloud environment, where you have so many options
    to configure and you can declare each option and achieve the exact goal. The good
    news is that if it's becoming too complex for this method, for instance, when
    the orchestration tool is not able to understand the goal, you can always extend
    this method with a little bit of the imperative method using scripts.

    your workstation running Linux or **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (**WSL**). Along
    with this, we need a node, which needs to be an Azure VM. However, in order to
    provide a better explanation, we've deployed three nodes. If you have budget constraints
    in your Azure subscription, feel free to proceed with one node. It doesn't matter
    which Linux distribution you're using. The examples in this section, to orchestrate
    the node, are for an Ubuntu node, but it's easy to translate them to other distributions.

    want multiple VMs with the same configuration? We are back to square one, where
    you have to repeat the configuration multiple times, which is a time-consuming
    and boring task. Here comes the role of orchestration, as we discussed in the
    introduction. We can make use of orchestration tools to deploy the VM with the
    state we want. The tools will take care of the configuration. Also, in Azure,
    we have Azure Policy Guest Configuration, which can be used to audit the settings.
    Using this policy, we can define a condition that the VM should be in. If the
    evaluation fails or the condition is not met, Azure will mark this machine as
    non-compliant.

    however, you can also use JSON. Terraform is supported in macOS, Linux, and Windows.

    subscription that already has resources, Azure Policy can only act on resources
    that are created post assignment. However, if any of the existing resources before
    assignment don't comply with the policy, they will be marked as "non-compliant"
    so an administrator can rectify them if necessary. Also, Azure Policy will only

    this task using the Guest Configuration extension and client. The extension and

    of an application, its state, and also the environmental settings of the guest
    OS.

    Configuration extension for Linux. As discussed earlier, they work hand-in-hand,

    the user to audit the policies on the VM. Chef InSpec ([https://www.inspec.io/docs/](https://www.inspec.io/docs/))

    `puppetlabs/azure` provides you with everything you'll need. Both modules need
    the Azure CLI to work. The integration of the Azure CLI in their commercial Puppet
    Enterprise product is amazingly good. Azure has a VM extension that's available

    such as a knife. In Chef, much of its terminology comes from the kitchen. Chef
    integrates very well with Azure, especially if you use Chef Automate from Azure

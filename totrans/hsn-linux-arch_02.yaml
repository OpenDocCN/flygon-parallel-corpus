    who understands the technical part of the requirements. They are looking for an

    OSS，从而降低前期成本。解决方案将部署在现有的虚拟环境中，其支持将由我们的内部 Linux 团队处理，并且更新将由我们自己的更新管理解决方案在内部进行。用户群体将每两个月增长一次，这在我们的采购流程范围内，允许我们相当快速地获取新资源，而不会产生资源争用的长时间。用户增长将主要影响计算资源。

    and version control infrastructure that it is already in place, so, possibly,
    only monitoring agents will be needed for your new solution.

- en: A POC is the process of demonstrating an idea or method, in our case a solution,
    with the aim of verifying a given functionality. Additionally, it provides a broad
    overview of how the solution will behave within an environment, allowing further
    testing to be able to fine-tune for specific workloads and use cases.

- en: Any POC will have its advantages and disadvantages, but the main focus is for
    customers and architects to explore the different concepts of the solution of
    an actual working environment. It is important to note that you, as an architect,
    have a heavy influence in which POC will be used as a final solution, but the
    customer is the one who chooses which constraints and advantages suit their business
    better.

- en: With the example of choosing an NGINX as a load balancer to provide high availability
    and performance improvements to Apache web servers hosting the application files,
    we can implement a working solution with scaled-down resources. Instead of deploying
    four nodes for the final solution, we can deploy just two to demonstrate the load-balancing
    features as well as provide a practical demonstration of high availability by
    purposely bringing one of them down.

- en: This does not require the full four-node cluster that was envisioned during
    the design phase, as we're not testing the full performance of the entire solution.
    For performance or load testing, this can be done by having less concurrent users
    provide a close to actual workload for the application. While having fewer users
    will never provide exact performance numbers for the full implementation, it delivers
    a good baseline with data that can later be extrapolated to provide an approximation
    of what the actual performance will be.

- en: As an example for performance testing, instead of having 2,000 users load the
    application, we can have a quarter of the userbase and half of the resources.
    This will considerably decrease the amount of resources needed, while providing
    enough data to be able to analyze the performance of the final solution at the
    same time.

    we can start constructing our design. At this stage, you will be facing different
    obstacles, as implementing the POC in a development or QA environment might vary
    from production. Things that worked in QA or development may now fail in production,
    and different variables might be in place; all these things only arise at the
    implementation stage, and you need to be aware that, in a worst-case scenario,
    it might mean changing a large amount of the initial design.

    so it is of utmost importance to ensure that the changes you make won't affect
    the current production. Working with the customer is also important, because this
    will familiarize their IT team with the new solution; this way, when the sign-off
    is done, they will be familiar with it and its configuration.

    this stage, since it will document each step and every minor configuration made
    to the solution. It will also help in the future in case an issue appears and
    the support team needs to know how it was configured in order to be able to solve
    the problem.

    while at the same time asking the right questions. This will help define the actual
    requirements and narrow the scope to the real business needs. Working with the
    initial problem statement will impose problems further down the road, making this
    stage extremely important, as it will prevent unnecessarily going back and forth.

- en: Then, we considered the possible paths or solutions we can take to solve the
    already defined problem. With the right questions asked in the previous stage,
    we should be able to construct several options for the customer to select, and
    can later implement a POC. POCs help both customers and architects understand
    how the solution will behave in an actual working environment. Normally, POCs
    are scaled-down versions of the final solution, making implementation and testing
    more agile.

  zh: 然后，我们考虑了解决已定义问题的可能路径或解决方案。通过在前一阶段提出正确的问题，我们应该能够构建几个选项供客户选择，并且稍后可以实施POC。POC有助于客户和架构师了解解决方案在实际工作环境中的行为。通常，POC是最终解决方案的缩减版本，使实施和测试更加灵活。
- en: Finally, the implementation stage deals with the actual configuration and hands-on
    aspects of the project. Based on the findings during the POC, changes can be made
    to accommodate the specifics of each infrastructure. Documentation delivered through
    this stage will help align parties to ensure that the solution is implemented
    as expected.

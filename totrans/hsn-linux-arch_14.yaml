    doing searches or incoming indexes; be sure to size for as much RAM as possible.
    There is a point were cache usage will balance out, and no more RAM will be used
    for the page cache. At this point, it is worth monitoring the process to try and
    identify this threshold to avoid running into unnecessary charges. To put it into
    perspective, if a **Virtual Machine** (**VM**) is sized with 32 GB of RAM, but
    only uses about 10 GB for the cache and never goes above this number, then it
    might be worth resizing to a smaller VM, as the remaining RAM will be left unused.

- en: The primary variable would be the size of the logs/metrics that are sent to
    Elasticsearch. This depends on the number of logs that are generated daily (or
    monthly). For example, if the daily log rate is 100 MB, then that means that,
    to be able to store a month's worth of logs, at least 3 GB of available space
    is needed (100 MB x 30 days = 3 GB).

  zh: 主要变量将是发送到Elasticsearch的日志/指标的大小。这取决于每天（或每月）生成的日志数量。例如，如果每天的日志速率为100 MB，那么这意味着至少需要3
    GB的可用空间才能存储一个月的日志（100 MB x 30天 = 3 GB）。
- en: Note that this is the minimum space required for a single source. Ideally, some
    overhead should be accounted for as data changes regularly and a figure of 100
    MB/day might not be constant for all of the days in the month or other months
    might have a higher rate due to higher load. Additionally, once more sources (or

    there is some overhead required to complete the process. If Logstash is to be
    installed on its own (with no other components on the same system), anything above
    one vCPU and 2 GBs of RAM should suffice for small/testing deployments. Ideally,
    the actual usage should be monitored and the system tuned accordingly. Logstash
    by default has in-memory queues that are used to store events temporarily; this
    behavior can be changed to use persistent queues when processing events. This
    allows for persistent consistency and avoids data loss during an outage. Additionally,
    having persistent queues helps to absorb bursts of events by acting as a buffer
    between the clients and Logstash.
  id: totrans-120

  zh: Logstash对CPU和内存的要求不高，但这完全取决于有多少来源在向Logstash提供数据，因为Logstash解析每个事件都需要一些额外的开销来完成这个过程。如果Logstash要单独安装（没有其他组件在同一系统上），那么一个vCPU和2GB的RAM应该足够小型/测试部署。理想情况下，应该监控实际使用情况并相应地调整系统。Logstash默认具有用于临时存储事件的内存队列；当处理事件时，这种行为可以更改为使用持久队列。这样可以实现持久一致性，并避免在故障期间丢失数据。此外，持久队列有助于吸收事件的突发增长，充当客户端和Logstash之间的缓冲区。
- en: 'When using persistent queues for storage capacity, the `/var/lib/logstash`

    The amount of space depends on two factors: the egress speed when sending data

  zh: 摘要
- en: In this chapter, we went through the requirements that are needed when designing
    an Elastic Stack using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. For Elasticsearch,
    we determined that the minimum CPU requirement is two vCPUs for small setups,
    and the CPU speed should be kept above 2 GHz. If these minimum requirements are
    not met, Elasticsearch will take longer to start up and will perform more slowly.
    This manifests as a decrease in the number of indexes per second and an increased
    search latency, both of which are things that need to be avoided in order for
    us to be able to take full advantage of the near-instant searches that Elasticsearch
    provides.

  zh: 在本章中，我们介绍了在设计使用Elasticsearch、Logstash和Kibana的Elastic Stack时所需的要求。对于Elasticsearch，我们确定了小型设置的最低CPU要求为两个vCPU，CPU速度应保持在2
    GHz以上。如果不满足这些最低要求，Elasticsearch将需要更长的时间启动，并且性能将更慢。这表现为每秒索引数量的减少和搜索延迟的增加，这两者都是需要避免的，以便我们能够充分利用Elasticsearch提供的几乎即时搜索。
- en: Memory sizing is probably the most important specification when designing an
    Elasticsearch setup. Part of the system memory will be used for the filesystem
    cache (also known as the page cache), which helps with searches and indexes per
    second. Swapping is not recommended, as it is considered extremely slow when compared
    to actual RAM access, and so swapping should be disabled on Elasticsearch nodes.
    If the correct memory requirements are not met, Elasticsearch will fail to start
    altogether since there will not be enough memory for the JVM to start. If, on
    the other hand, enough memory is present to start the JVM, but the load increases
    over time and the system runs out of memory, the OOM or out-of-memory killer will
    be engaged to avoid a system crash that would lead to a failure of the application.
    The very minimum amount of RAM required is 2.5 GB, but resource constraints will
    be seen relatively quickly.

  zh: 在设计Elasticsearch设置时，内存大小可能是最重要的规格。系统内存的一部分将用于文件系统缓存（也称为页面缓存），这有助于搜索和每秒索引。不建议交换，因为与实际的RAM访问相比，它被认为是非常慢的，因此应该在Elasticsearch节点上禁用交换。如果未满足正确的内存要求，Elasticsearch将无法启动，因为JVM启动时没有足够的内存。另一方面，如果有足够的内存来启动JVM，但随着时间的推移负载增加，系统耗尽内存，OOM或内存耗尽杀手将被启用，以避免导致应用程序失败的系统崩溃。所需的最小RAM量为2.5
    GB，但资源限制将相对快速地被看到。

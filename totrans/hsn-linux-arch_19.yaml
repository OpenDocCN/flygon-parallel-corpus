    server; for instance, a small web application that will not be serving a lot of
    user requests has no place on a 64-core 1 TB of RAM physical server. It's a waste
    of resources and a terrible economic decision. Most of the time, 90% of this server

    else. These types of applications should be put into a VM or containerized altogether.

    sharing their resources across multiple hosted VMs, they require large quantities
    of resources. One thing to note is that some of the resources of the hypervisor
    will be consumed by the hypervisor itself, which creates a resource overhead on

  zh: 虚拟化监控器在裸金属服务器上也更好；因为它们将在多个托管的虚拟机之间共享资源，所以需要大量资源。需要注意的一点是，监控器的一些资源将被监控器本身消耗，这会在硬件中断和其他操作上产生资源开销。
- en: Sometimes, when building physical servers, we focus a lot on the CPU cores that
    our application will need. With hypervisors, CPU time is served to VMs on priority
    or a first-come-first-served basis to the available core; depending on how it
    is configured, the CPU resource is shared across the running VMs. On the contrary,
    RAM memory is not shared across the VMs, and we need to be careful in the resource
    balancing that we are implementing. Deploying a server with the necessary CPU
    cores but with enough RAM that can satisfy any period of contention that we can
    face is something to take into account. With hundreds of VMs running on a single
    host, we can run out of memory really quickly and start swapping, and this is
    a situation that we want to avoid.
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 有时，在构建物理服务器时，我们会非常关注应用程序所需的CPU核心。对于虚拟化监控器，CPU时间优先分配给虚拟机，或者按照可用核心的先到先服务的原则分配给虚拟机；根据配置方式，CPU资源在运行的虚拟机之间共享。相反，RAM内存不会在虚拟机之间共享，我们需要在实施资源平衡时小心谨慎。部署具有必要CPU核心但具有足够RAM的服务器，可以满足我们可能面临的任何争用期的需求是需要考虑的。在单个主机上运行数百个虚拟机时，我们可能会很快耗尽内存并开始交换，这是我们要避免的情况。
- en: With resource provisioning, we also need to take into account that if we are
    running a cluster of hypervisors, there can be situations when one of the cluster
    nodes needs to go into maintenance or go down because of an unexpected failure.
    Scenarios such as this are the reason we should always leave some resources to
    be able to manage additional unexpected workloads from VMs that might failover
    due to the aforementioned reasons.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在资源配置方面，我们还需要考虑的是，如果我们运行一组虚拟化监控器，可能会出现集群节点需要进行维护或由于意外故障而宕机的情况。正是因为这样的情况，我们应该始终留出一些资源，以便能够处理由于上述原因可能发生故障转移的虚拟机的额外意外工作负载。
- en: When dealing with hypervisors, you have to be careful, as you will not be running
    just a single workload per physical host. The number and the VMs themselves will
    always vary, unless you have some type of affinity rule configured. Things such
    as how much network bandwidth your network interface cards support are of utmost
    relevance. Depending on the amount of resources of the host hypervisor, tens or
    hundreds of VMs will be sharing the same network hardware to perform their I/O.
    Here is where deciding, for example, whether a 10 GbE network card instead of
    a 1 GbE network card is required.
  id: totrans-47
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One more thing to take into consideration when picking the network interfaces
    of your physical host is the type of storage you will be using; for example, if
    you are considering a **network filesystem **(**NFS**) solution or an iSCSI solution,
    you have to keep in mind that, many times, they will be sharing the same interfaces
    such as the ones for the regular network traffic. If you know the infrastructure
    you are designing will have a very congested network and require a good storage
    performance, it is better to have another approach, such as choosing a fibre channel
    storage area network, with its own dedicated hardware just for storage I/O.

- en: Network segmentation is crucial for virtualized environments, management traffic,
    application network traffic, and storage network traffic, which should always
    be segmented. You can achieve this in several ways, such as by provisioning dedicated
    network interface cards for each purpose or via VLAN tagging. Each hypervisor
    will have its own set of tools to achieve segmentation, but the idea behind it
    is the same.

- en: Classical statistics is also called frequentist because it interprets probability
    as the relative frequency of an event over the long run, that is, after observing
    a large number of trials. In the context of probabilities, an event is a combination
    of one or more elementary outcomes of an experiment, such as any of six equal
    results in rolls of two dice or an asset price dropping by 10% or more on a given
    day.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bayesian statistics, in contrast, views probability as a measure of the confidence
    or belief in the occurrence of an event. The Bayesian perspective of probability
    leaves more room for subjective views and, consequently, differences in opinions
    than the frequentist interpretation. This difference is most striking for events
    that do not happen often enough to arrive at an objective measure of long-term
    frequency.

- en: Put differently, frequentist statistics assume that data is a random sample
    from a population and aims to identify the fixed parameters that generated the
    data. Bayesian statistics, in turn, take the data as given and considers the parameters
    to be random variables with a distribution that can be inferred from data. As
    a result, frequentist approaches require at least as many data points as there
    are parameters to be estimated. Bayesian approaches, on the other hand, are compatible
    with smaller datasets and are well-suited for online learning, one sample at a
    time.

- en: PyMC3 was released in January 2017 to add Hamiltonian MC methods to the Metropolis-Hastings
    sampler that's used in PyMC2 (released in 2012). PyMC3 uses Theano as its computational
    backend for dynamic C compilation and automatic differentiation. Theano is a matrix-focused
    and GPU-enabled optimization library that was developed at Yoshua Bengio's Montreal
    Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and inspired TensorFlow. MILA recently
    ceased to further develop Theano due to the success of newer deep learning libraries
    (see Chapter 16 *Deep Learning* for details). PyMC4, which is planned for 2019,
    will use TensorFlow instead, with presumably limited impact on the API.

    Learning Workflow*, logistic regression estimates a linear relationship between
    a set of features and a binary outcome, which is mediated by a sigmoid function
    to ensure that the model produces probabilities. The frequentist approach resulted
    in point estimates for the parameters that measure the influence of each feature
    on the probability that a data point belongs to the positive class, with confidence
    intervals based on assumptions about the parameter distribution.

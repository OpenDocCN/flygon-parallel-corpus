    for microservices based on Spring Boot. To allow our microservices to communicate
    with Netflix Eureka, we will use the Spring Cloud module for Netflix Eureka clients.
    Before we delve into the details, we will elaborate on why a discovery server
    is needed and why a DNS server isn't sufficient.

    provide a discovery service using a server-side *service* concept in Kubernetes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Cloud comes with an abstraction of how to communicate with a discovery
    service such as Netflix Eureka and provides an interface called `DiscoveryClient`.
    This can be used to interact with a discovery service to get information regarding
    available services and instances. Implementations of the `DiscoveryClient` interface
    are also capable of automatically registering a Spring Boot application with the
    discovery server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Boot can find implementations of the `DiscoveryClient` interface automatically
    during startup, so we only need to bring in a dependency on the corresponding
    implementation to connect to a discovery server. In the case of Netflix Eureka,
    the dependency that's used by our microservices is `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Cloud also has `DiscoveryClient` implementations that support the use
    of either Apache Zookeeper or HashiCorp Consul as a discovery server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spring Cloud also comes with an abstraction—the `LoadBalancerClient` interface—for
    clients that want to make requests through a load balancer to registered instances
    in the discovery service. The standard reactive HTTP client, `WebClient`, can
    be configured to use the `LoadBalancerClient` implementation. By adding the `@LoadBalanced`
    annotation to an `@Bean` declaration that returns a `WebClient.Builder` object,
    a `LoadBalancerClient` implementation will be injected into the `Builder` instance
    as `ExchangeFilterFunction`. With the `spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client` dependency
    on the classpath, `RibbonLoadBalancerClient` will be automatically injected, that
    is, a load balancer based on Netflix Ribbon. So, even though a Netflix Ribbon
    is placed in maintenance mode, as described in [Chapter 8](9878a36a-5760-41a4-a132-1a2387b61037.xhtml),

- en: Netflix Eureka is a highly configurable discovery server that can be set up
    for a number of different use cases, and it provides robust, resilient, and fault-tolerant
    runtime characteristics. One downside of this flexibility and robustness is that
    it has an almost overwhelming number of configuration options. Fortunately, Netflix
    Eureka comes with good default values for most of the configurable parameters—at
    least when it comes to using them in a production environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to using Netflix Eureka during development, the default values
    cause long startup times. For example, it can take a long time for a client to
    make an initial successful call to a microservices instance that is registered
    in the Eureka server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up to two minutes of wait time can be experienced when using the default configuration
    values. This wait time is added to the time it takes for the Eureka service and
    the microservices to start up. The reason for this wait time is that the involved
    processes need to synchronize registration information with each other.
  prefs: []

    Due to this, it still thinks that there are two instances up and running. Every
    second call to the client will cause it to call a `review` instance that no longer
    exists, resulting in the response from the client not containing any information
    from the `review` service. The service address of the `review` service will be
    empty.

    of a discovery service. If even higher availability is desired, multiple Eureka
    servers can be launched and configured to communicate with each other. Details
    on how to set up multiple Eureka servers can be found in the Spring Cloud documentation: [https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Greenwich.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server-peer-awareness](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/Greenwich.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud.html#spring-cloud-eureka-server-peer-awareness).

    First, we looked into the shortcomings of a simple DNS-based service discovery
    solution and the challenges that a robust and resilient service discovery solution
    must be able to handle.

- en: Netflix Eureka is a very capable service discovery solution that provides robust,
    resilient, and fault-tolerant runtime characteristics. However, it can be challenging
    to configure correctly, especially for smooth developer experience. With Spring
    Cloud, it becomes easy to set up a Netflix Eureka server and adapt Spring Boot-based
    microservices, both so that they can register themselves to Eureka during startup
    and, when acting as a client to other microservices, to keep track of available
    microservices instances.

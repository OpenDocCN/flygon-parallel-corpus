- en: In this chapter, we will learn how to use Spring Cloud Gateway as an edge server,
    that is, to control what APIs are exposed from our microservices-based system
    landscape. We will see how microservices that have public APIs will be made accessible
    from the outside through the edge server, while microservices that have private
    APIs only will be accessible from the inside of the microservice landscape. In
    our system landscape, this means that the product composite service and the discovery
    service, Netflix Eureka, will be exposed through the edge server. The three core
    services—`product`, `recommendation`, and `review`—will be hidden from the outside.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we have seen how Spring Cloud Gateway can be used as an edge
    server to control what services are allowed to be called from the outside of the
    system landscape. Based on predicates, filters, and destination URIs, we can define
    routing rules in a very flexible way. If we want to, we can configure Spring Cloud
    Gateway to use a discovery service such as Netflix Eureka to look up the target
    microservice instances.

    to the APIs exposed by the edge server and how we can prevent third parties from
    intercepting the traffic.

    using standard security mechanisms such as HTTPS, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.

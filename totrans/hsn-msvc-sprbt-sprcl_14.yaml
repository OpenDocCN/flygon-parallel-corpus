    to centralize managing the configuration of our microservices. As already described
    in [Chapter 1](282e7b49-42b8-4649-af81-b4b6830d391d.xhtml), *Introduction to Microservices*,
    in the *Central configuration* section, an increasing number of microservices
    typically come with an increasing number of configuration files that need to be
    managed and updated.

- en: With the Spring Cloud Configuration server, we can place the configuration files
    for all our microservices in a central configuration repository that will make
    it much easier to handle them. Our microservices will be updated to retrieve their
    configuration from the configuration server at startup.

    Based on the configuration, it connects to the discovery server, that is, Netflix
    Eureka in our case, to register itself. It is also possible to do this the other
    way around, that is, the client first connects to the discovery server to find
    a config server instance and then connects to the config server to get its configuration.
    There are pros and cons to both approaches.

    become a single point of failure. If the clients connect first to a discovery
    service, such as Netflix Eureka, there can be multiple config server instances
    registered, so that a single point of failure can be avoided. When, later on in
    this book, we learn about the *service* concept in Kubernetes, we will see how
    we can avoid a single point of failure by running multiple containers, for example,
    config servers, behind each Kubernetes service.

    This means that we need to secure the configuration information both in transit
    and at rest. From a runtime perspective, the config server does not need to be
    exposed to the outside through the edge server. During development, it is, however,
    useful to be able to access the API of the config server to check the configuration.
    In production environments, it is recommended to lock down external access to
    the config server.

    can steal sensitive information, such as passwords, the config server supports
    encryption of configuration information when stored on disk. The config server
    supports using both symmetric and asymmetric keys. Asymmetric keys are more secure
    but harder to manage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the config server at startup by specifying an environment variable, `ENCRYPT_KEY`.
    The encrypted key is just a plain text string that needs to be protected in the
    same way as any sensitive information.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we have seen how we can use the Spring Cloud Configuration
    server to centralize managing the configuration of our microservices. We can place
    the configuration files in a common configuration repository and share common
    configurations in a single configuration file while keeping microservice-specific
    configuration in microservice specific configuration files. The microservices
    have been updated to retrieve their configuration from the config server at startup
    and are configured to handle temporary outages while retrieving their configuration
    from the config server.

- en: The config server can protect configuration information by requiring authenticated
    usage of its API with basic HTTP authentication, and can prevent eavesdropping
    by exposing its API externally through the edge server that uses HTTPS. To prevent
    intruders who obtained access to the configuration files on disk from gaining
    access to sensitive information such as passwords, we can use the config server
    `/encrypt` endpoint to encrypt the information and store it encrypted on disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While exposing the APIs from the config server externally is useful during development,
    they should be locked down before use in production.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the next chapter, we will learn how we can use *Resilience4j* to mitigate
    the potential drawbacks of overusing synchronous communication between microservices.
    If we, for example, establish chains of microservices that call each other synchronously
    using REST APIs, and the last microservice stops responding, bad things can happen
    that affect many of the microservices involved. Resilience4j comes with an implementation
    of the circuit breaker pattern, which can be used to handle these types of problem.

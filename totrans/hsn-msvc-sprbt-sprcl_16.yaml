- en: In this chapter, we will learn how to use distributed tracing to better understand
    how our microservices cooperate; for example, fulfilling a request sent to the
    external API. Being able to utilize distributed tracing is essential for being
    able to manage a system landscape of cooperating microservices. As already described
    in [Chapter 8](9878a36a-5760-41a4-a132-1a2387b61037.xhtml), *Introduction to Spring
    Cloud*, in reference to the *Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing* section,
    Spring Cloud Sleuth will be used to collect trace information, and Zipkin will
    be used for the storage and visualization of said trace information.

    out for us and makes the information presentable in the Zipkin UI. The important
    point here is that we can see that the trace events actually were sent to the
    Zipkin server using Kafka.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we have learned how to use distributed tracing to understand
    how our microservices cooperate. We have learned how to use Spring Cloud Sleuth
    to collect trace information, and how to use Zipkin to store and visualize the
    trace information.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To promote the decoupling of runtime components, we have learned how to configure
    microservices to send trace information to the Zipkin server asynchronously while
    using RabbitMQ and Kafka as message brokers. We have seen how adding Spring Cloud
    Sleuth to microservices is effected by adding a couple of dependencies to the
    build files and setting up a few configuration parameters. We have also seen how
    the Zipkin UI makes it very easy to identify what part of a complex workflow caused
    either an unexpectedly long response time or an error. Both synchronous and asynchronous
    workflows can be visualized by Zipkin UI.

    Kubernetes. We will learn how to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage microservices,
    while also improving important runtime characteristics such as scalability, high
    availability, and resilience.

    widely used container orchestrator at the time of writing this book. Since the
    subjects on container orchestrators in general and Kubernetes itself are too big
    to be covered in one chapter, I will focus on introducing the areas that I have
    found to be the most important when I used Kubernetes over the last few years.

- en: At a high level, as a container orchestrator, Kubernetes makes a cluster of
    servers (physical or virtual) that run containers appear as one big logical server
    running containers. As an operator, we declare a desired state to the Kubernetes
    cluster by creating objects using the Kubernetes API. Kubernetes continuously
    compares the desired state with the current state. If it detects differences,
    it takes actions to ensure that the current state is the same as the desired state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main purposes of a Kubernetes cluster is to deploy and run containers,
    but also to support zero-downtime rolling upgrades using techniques such as green/blue
    and canary deployments. Kubernetes can schedule containers, that is, **pods** that
    contain one or more co-located containers, to the available nodes in the cluster.
    To be able to monitor the health of running containers, Kubernetes assumes that
    containers implement a **liveness** **probe**. If a liveness probe reports an
    unhealthy container, Kubernetes will restart the container. Containers can be
    scaled in the cluster manually or automatically using a horizontal autoscaler.
    To optimize the use of the available hardware resources in a cluster, for example,
    memory and CPU, containers can be configured with **quotas** that specify how
    much resources a container needs. On the other hand, limits regarding how much
    a group of containers is allowed to consume can be specified on a **namespace**
    level. Namespaces will be introduced as we proceed through this chapter. This
    is of extra importance if several teams share a common Kubernetes cluster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another main purpose of Kubernetes is to provide service discovery of the running
    pods and its containers. Kubernetes `Service` objects can be defined for services
    discovery and will also load balance incoming requests over the available pods.
    `Service` objects can be exposed externally of a Kubernetes cluster. However,
    as we will see, an Ingress object is, in many cases, better suited to handling
    externally incoming traffic to a group of services. To help Kubernetes find out
    whether a container is ready to accept incoming requests, a container can implement
    a **readiness probe**.

- en: Internally, a Kubernetes cluster provides one big flat IP network where each
    pod gets its own IP address and can reach all the other pods, independent of what
    node they run on. To support multiple network vendors, Kubernetes allows the use
    of network plugins that comply with the **Container Network Interface** (**CNI**) specification
    ([https://github.com/containernetworking/cni](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni)).
    Pods are not isolated by default, that is, they accept all incoming requests.
    CNI plugins that support the use of network policy definitions can be used to
    lock down access to pods, for example, only allowing traffic from pods in the
    same namespace.

- en: To allow multiple teams to work on the same Kubernetes cluster in a safe way, **Role-Based
    Access Control** (**RBAC**, [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac)/)
    can be applied. For example, administrators can be authorized to access resources
    on a cluster level, while the access of team members can be locked down to resources
    that are created in a namespace owned by the teams.

- en: Summary
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we have been introduced to Kubernetes as a container orchestrator.
    Kubernetes makes a cluster of servers that run containers appear as one big logical
    server. As an operator, we declare a desired state to the cluster and Kubernetes
    continuously compares the desired state with the current state. If it detects
    differences, it takes actions to ensure that the current state is the same as
    the desired state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The desired state is declared by creating resources using the Kubernetes API
    server. The controller manager in Kubernetes and its controllers react to the
    various resources that were created by the API server and takes actions to ensure
    that the current state meets the new desired state. The scheduler assigns nodes
    to newly created containers, that is, pods that contain one or more containers.
    On each node, an agent, `kubelet`, runs and ensures that the pods that were scheduled
    to its node are up and running. `kube-proxy` acts as a network proxy, enabling
    a service abstraction by forwarding requests that are sent to the service to available
    pods in the cluster. External requests can be handled either by a service that
    specifies a node port that's available on all of the nodes in the cluster or through
    a dedicated Ingress resource.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have also tried out Kubernetes by creating a local single-node cluster using
    Minikube and VirtualBox. Using the Kubernetes CLI tool known as `kubectl`, we
    deployed a simple web server based on NGINX. We tried out resilience capabilities
    by deleting the web server, and we observed it being recreated automatically and
    scaled it by requesting three pods running on the web server. Finally, we created
    a service with a node port and verified that we could access it both externally
    and from the inside of the cluster.

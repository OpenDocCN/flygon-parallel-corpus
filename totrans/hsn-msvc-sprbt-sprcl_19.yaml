    We will also learn about some of the core features of Kubernetes, such as using
    **Kustomize** to configure deployments for different runtime environments and
    using Kubernetes deployments object for rolling upgrades. Before we do that, we
    need to review how we use service discovery. Since Kubernetes comes with built-in
    support for service discovery, it seems unnecessary to deploy our own since we
    have been using Netflix Eureka up to this point.

- en: As shown in the previous chapter, [Chapter 15](87949e5b-2761-4dc1-a70c-d9d21f03d530.xhtml),
    *Introduction to Kubernetes*, Kubernetes comes with a built-in discovery service
    based on Kubernetes `Service` objects and the `kube-proxy` runtime component.
    This makes it unnecessary to deploy a separate discovery service such as Netflix
    Eureka, which we used in the previous chapters. An advantage of using Kubernetes
    discovery service is that it doesn't require a client library such as Netflix
    Ribbon, which we have been using together with Netflix Eureka. This makes the
    Kubernetes discovery service easy to use, independent of which language or framework
    a microservice is based on. A drawback of using the Kubernetes discovery service
    is that it only works in a Kubernetes environment. However, since the discovery
    service is based on `kube-proxy`, which accepts requests to the DNS name or IP
    address of a service object, it should be fairly simple to replace it with a similar
    discovery service, for example, one that comes bundled with another container
    orchestrator.

    responding with 200 (OK) typically means that the microservice instance has problems

- en: Finding optimal settings for the probes can be challenging, that is, finding
    a proper balance between getting a swift reaction from Kubernetes when the availability
    of a pod changes and not overloading the pods with probe requests. Specifically
    configuring a liveness probe with values that are too low can result in Kubernetes
    restarting pods that just take some time to start, that is, that don't need to
    be restarted. Starting a large number of pods with values that have been set too
    low on the liveness probes can result in a lot of unnecessary restarts. Setting
    the configuration values too high on the probes (except for the `successThreshold`
    value) makes Kubernetes react slower, which can be annoying in a development environment.
    Proper values also depend on the available hardware, which affects the startup
    times for the pods. For the scope of this book, `failureThreshold` for the liveness
    probes is set to a high value, `20`, to avoid unnecessary restarts on computers
    with limited hardware resources.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, updates often result in some downtime of the component that is
    updated. In a system landscape with an increasing number of autonomous microservices
    that are updated independently of each other, recurring downtimes due to frequent
    updates of the microservices is not acceptable. Being able to deploy an update
    without downtime becomes crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we will see how we can perform a rolling upgrade, updating
    a microservice to a new version of its Docker image without requiring any downtime.
    Performing a rolling upgrade means that Kubernetes first starts the new version
    of the microservice in a new pod, and when it reports as being healthy, Kubernetes
    will terminate the old one. This ensures that there is always a pod up and running,
    ready to serve incoming requests during the upgrade. A prerequisite for a rolling
    upgrade to work is that the upgrade is backward compatible, both in terms of APIs
    and message formats that are used to communicate with other services and database
    structures. If the new version of the microservice requires changes to either
    the external APIs, message formats, or database structures that the old version
    can't handle, a rolling upgrade can't be applied. A deployment object is configured
    to perform any updates as a rolling upgrade by default.

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to deploy the microservices in this book on
    Kubernetes. We also introduced some core features in Kubernetes, such as using Kustomize to
    configure deployments for different runtime environments, using Kubernetes deployment
    objects for rolling upgrades, and how to roll back a failed update if required. To
    help Kubernetes understand when the microservices need to be restarted and if
    they are ready to accept requests, we implemented liveness and readiness probes.

- en: Finally, to be able to deploy our microservices, we had to replace Netflix Eureka
    with the built-in discovery service in Kubernetes. Changing the discovery service
    was done without any code changes – all we had to do was apply changes to the
    build dependencies and some of the configuration.

- en: In the next chapter, we will see how we can further utilize Kubernetes to reduce
    the number of supporting services we need to deploy in Kubernetes. Head over to
    the next chapter to see how we can eliminate the need for the configuration server
    and how our edge server can be replaced by a Kubernetes ingress controller.

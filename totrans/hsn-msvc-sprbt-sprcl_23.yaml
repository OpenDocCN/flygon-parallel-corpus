    monitor, and alert about performance metrics. As we mentioned in [Chapter 1](282e7b49-42b8-4649-af81-b4b6830d391d.xhtml),
    *Introduction to Microservices*, in the *Centralized monitoring and alarms* section,
    in a production environment, it is crucial to be able to collect metrics for application
    performance and hardware resource usage. Monitoring these metrics is required
    in order to avoid long response times or outages for API requests and other processes.

    a Service Mesh to Improve Observability and Management*, in the *Deploying Istio
    in the Kubernetes cluster* section. Also in that chapter, in the *Introducing
    the runtime components in Istio* section, we were briefly introduced to Prometheus,
    a popular open source database for time series such as performance metrics. We
    were also introduced to Grafana as an open source tool for visualizing performance
    metrics. Istio's console for observability, Kiali, is integrated with Grafana.
    A user can navigate from a service of interest in Kiali to its corresponding performance
    metrics in Grafana. Kiali can also render some performance-related graphs without
    the use of Grafana. In this chapter, we will get some hands-on experience with
    this integration by using these tools together.

    a Service Mesh to Improve Observability and Management*, includes a configuration
    of Prometheus, where it automatically collects metrics from pods in Kubernetes.
    All we need to do is set up an endpoint in our microservice that produces metrics
    in a format Prometheus can consume. We also need to add annotations to the Kubernetes
    pods so that Prometheus can find the address of the endpoints. See the *Changes
    in source code for collecting application metrics* section of this chapter for
    details on how to set this up.

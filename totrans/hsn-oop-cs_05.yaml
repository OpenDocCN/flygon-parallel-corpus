    In English, the word **exception** refers to something unusual that doesn''t usually
    happen. In programming, the word exception has a similar meaning, but is related
    to software code. By their nature, computer programs should do only those things
    that we instruct them to do, and it is considered abnormal when a computer won''t
    or can''t follow our instructions. If the computer program fails to follow our
    instructions, it is classified as an exception in the software world.'

  zh: 让我们从两个词开始：异常和处理。在英语中，**exception**一词指的是不经常发生的异常情况。在编程中，异常一词有类似的含义，但与软件代码有关。根据它们的性质，计算机程序应该只执行我们指示它们执行的操作，当计算机不能或无法遵循我们的指示时，这被认为是异常。如果计算机程序无法遵循我们的指示，它在软件世界中被归类为异常。
- en: '**Error **is another word that is heavily used in programming. It is important
    for us to understand that an error and an exception are not the same thing. An
    error refers to an incident where the software couldn''t even run. More specifically,
    an error means that the code that is written contains something wrong, and that
    is why the compiler couldn''t compile/build the code. On the other hand, an exception is
    something that happens at runtime. The easiest way to distinguish between these
    two concepts is—if the code doesn''t compile/build, then there is an error in
    your code. If the code compiles/builds, but when you run it you get some unusual
    behavior, then it''s an exception.'

    reasons why the file isn''t found there: the file may have been deleted by someone
    or may have been moved to another location. Now, what will your software do? It''s
    not smart enough to handle this situation automatically. If the software is not
    clear about its work, it will throw an exception. It is our duty as a software
    developer to tell the software what to do in these kind of situations.'

- en: The software will let us know that it is stuck and can't resolve the situation by
    passing a message. But what should it say to us? *"Help! Help!"* won't be an appropriate
    message, and this kind of message won't make the developer's life any easier.
    We need more information about the situation so that we can guide the computer
    to work accordingly. For that reason, the .NET framework has created some very
    common exceptions that occur very often in programming. If the problem that the
    software is facing has a predefined exception, it will throw that. For example,
    say that there is a program that is trying to divide a number by zero. Mathematically,
    this is not possible, but the computer has to do it because you have instructed
    it to do so. Now the computer is in big trouble; it's confused and helpless. It
    tries to divide the number by zero as you instructed, but then the compiler will
    stop it and say *"Ask for help, Mr. Program!"*, which means, *"T**hrow a* `DivideByZeroException`
    *to your master for help".* The program will then throw a `DivideByZeroException`
    and expect some code that the programmer has written to handle it. This is how
    we will actually know what exceptions we need to handle in the program. This is
    why we need exceptions in programming.

- en: The .NET framework and C# programming language have developed some powerful
    ways to handle exceptions. `System.Exceptions` is a class in .NET under the system
    namespace and has some functionality that will help you to manage exceptions that
    occur during runtime and prevent your program from crashing. If you don't handle
    exceptions properly in your code, your software will crash. This is why exception
    handling is very important in software development.

    is something unexpected. How can you know which exception will occur in your code
    and cause the program to crash? This is a very good question, and I am sure this
    question was also asked when language developers were designing the language.
    That is why they came up with a solution for .NET that has created a very beautiful
    mechanism to handle exceptions.

    throw a general exception instead of throwing a specific exception, you might
    miss some important information about the exception. For this reason, the C# language
    introduced multiple `catch` blocks for a `try` block. You can specify one `catch`
    block that will be called for one type of exception, and you can create other
    `catch` blocks just after one-by-one with different exception types. When a specific
    exception is thrown, only that particular `catch` block will be executed if it
    has a dedicated `catch` block for that kind of exception. Let''s look at an example:'

  zh: 在一个`try`块中获得不同类型的异常是正常的。但是你该如何处理它们呢？您不应该使用通用异常来做这个。如果您抛出通用异常而不是抛出特定异常，您可能会错过有关异常的一些重要信息。因此，C#语言为`try`块引入了多个`catch`块。您可以指定一个`catch`块，它将被一个类型的异常调用，并且您可以创建其他`catch`块，每个后面都有不同的异常类型。当抛出特定异常时，只有那个特定的`catch`块将被执行，如果它有一个专门的`catch`块来处理这种类型的异常。让我们看一个例子：

    handler. But why is that? Yes, we might miss some information but my system isn''t
    crashing! Isn''t it better this way?"* Actually, the answer to this question is
    not straightforward. It may vary from system to system, but let me tell you why
    you want the system to crash sometimes. Suppose you have a system where you deal
    with very complex and sensitive data. When an exception happens in such a system, it
    might be very risky to allow the customer to use the software. The customer could
    do some serious damage to the data, as the exception was not handled properly.
    But yes, if you think your system will be fine if you allow the user to continue,
    even if they got an unknown exception, you can use a general `catch` block. Now
    let me show you how you can do this. If you want a `catch` block to catch any
    kind of exception, regardless of the exception type, then your `catch` block should
    accept the `Exception` class as a parameter, as shown in the following code:'

  prefs: []

  zh: 现在你可能会想，“你说我们不应该使用通用异常处理程序。但为什么呢？是的，我们可能会错过一些信息，但我的系统没有崩溃！这样做不是更好吗？”实际上，这个问题的答案并不直接。这可能因系统而异，但让我告诉你为什么有时候你希望系统崩溃。假设你有一个处理非常复杂和敏感数据的系统。当这样的系统发生异常时，允许客户继续使用软件可能非常危险。客户可能会对数据造成严重破坏，因为异常没有得到适当处理。但是，如果你认为即使出现未知异常，如果允许用户继续使用系统也不会有问题，你可以使用通用的`catch`块。现在让我告诉你如何做到这一点。如果你希望`catch`块捕获任何类型的异常，无论异常类型如何，那么你的`catch`块应该接受`Exception`类作为参数，如下面的代码所示：

    doing this you are not becoming the bad guy; you are actually the hero who is

    a string that contains information about the exception. The exception is easier
    to read and understand when it is represented in string format.

    `Attempted to divide by zero`. In addition, the `ToString()` method gives a lot
    of information about the exception. These properties and methods will help you
    a lot when handling exceptions in your program.

    方法提供了大量关于异常的信息。这些属性和方法在处理程序中处理异常时会帮助你很多。

- en: To filter out exceptions, you have to use the `when` keyword just next to the
    `catch` declaration line. So first, when any exception is thrown, it will check
    what type of exception it is and then check the condition provided after the `when`
    keyword. In our example, the exception type is `IndexOutOfRangeException` and
    the condition is `ex.Message == "Index was outside the bounds of the array."`.
    We can see that, when the code ran, only that particular `catch` block was executed,
    which fulfilled all the conditions.

    errors and exceptions. Software developers don't want their software to break
    down, but unexpected exceptions happen every now and then. Consequently, handling
    these exceptions is necessary for developing awesome software. In this chapter,
    we familiarized ourselves with what an exception is in software development. We
    have also learned how to handle exceptions, why we need to handle exceptions,
    how to create custom exceptions, and many other important topics. When implementing
    exception handling in your application, try to follow best practices so that you
    get an application that runs smoothly.

- en: Visual Studio is an **integrated development environment** (**IDE**) from Microsoft.
    It's computer software, and a tool that can be used to write, debug, and execute
    code. Visual Studio is one of the most popular IDEs available in the industry,
    and is mainly used for .NET applications. As it is from Microsoft, it makes .NET
    development very easy and smooth. You can use Visual Studio for other programming
    languages, but I can't guarantee that it will be the most useful option; however,
    for C# developers like me, this is the best IDE available. As a developer, I spend
    most of my time in Visual Studio.

    Studio 2017\. Microsoft has introduced different editions of Visual Studio. One
    of these, the Community edition, is free. There are also two other editions: Visual
    Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise. The Professional and Enterprise
    editions are not free, and are more suitable for big projects. In this book, we
    will explore the features of the Community edition, as that is free and has sufficient

- en: Visual Studio is the best IDE for Microsoft-related technology stacks. You can
    use Visual Studio whether you are planning to develop a desktop application for
    Windows or a web application for Windows Server. The best part of using Visual
    Studio is that the IDE will help you with lots of common tasks that you would
    have to perform manually if you were not using it. For example, if you were planning
    to create a web application using ASP.NET **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**),
    Visual Studio can provide you a template for an MVC application. You can start
    with the template and modify it according to your requirements. Without this,
    you would have to download the packages, create the folders, and set the web configuration
    for the application. To get the full benefit of Visual Studio, you have to know
    the different projects and templates that come with it so that you can speed up
    your development process.

  zh: Visual Studio是与微软相关技术堆栈的最佳IDE。无论您是计划为Windows开发桌面应用程序还是为Windows Server开发Web应用程序，都可以使用Visual
    Studio。使用Visual Studio的最佳部分是，如果您没有使用它，IDE将帮助您完成许多常见任务，否则您将不得不手动执行这些任务。例如，如果您计划使用ASP.NET
    **Model-View-Controller**（**MVC**）创建Web应用程序，Visual Studio可以为您提供MVC应用程序的模板。您可以从模板开始，并根据您的要求进行修改。如果没有这个，您将不得不下载包，创建文件夹，并为应用程序设置Web配置。要充分利用Visual
    Studio，您必须了解它提供的不同项目和模板，以便加快开发过程。

    colors, underline marks, and symbols available in Visual Studio to help you understand
    the code better. If you are reading a black-and-white copy of this book, I would
    suggest that you open Visual Studio and write the code to check the color representation.
    For example, take a look at the `using` statements in the following screenshot.
    Apart from the `System` namespace, all other namespaces are in a duller color,
    which means that those namespaces are not yet in use in this file. The `System`
    namespace is bright white because we have used the `Console.WriteLine()` method
    in our code, which belongs to the `System` namespace. You can also see that there

    displays the files and folders in the solution you are working on. In Visual Studio,
    we have solutions that are like wrappers of different projects. This term could
    be a little confusing, as we would normally use the word *project* to identify
    a particular piece of work. In Visual Studio, solutions are created as wrappers
    and projects are created inside solutions. A solution can have multiple projects
    in it. This breakdown helps to make modular applications. In this Solution Explorer window,

    we have added another project called TestApp to the solution, as well as a class
    called Person in the ExploreVS project. You can also see the number of projects
    that the solutions contain next to the solution name. There is also a search option
    in the Solution Explorer to search files easily in big solutions, in addition
    to some other features hiding behind the icons at the top. The circular arrow
    refreshes the Solution Explorer. Next to that, the stacked boxes collapse the
    projects to get a high-level view of the solution. After that, the icon with the
    three documents shows all the documents in the Solution Explorer. This is necessary
    because not every file is always available for viewing, as Visual Studio gives
    us the option to exclude files from the solution. This doesn't delete the file
    from the filesystem, but just ignores it in the solution. Then, next to that icon,

    and windows, and its debugging facilities. We also looked at breakpoints, Call
    Stack Trace, and the Watch window, and how to use these to optimize your debugging
    process. After that, we explored Git and GitHub integration with Visual Studio.
    Finally, we talked about the different refactoring features that are available
    in Visual Studio. It's very hard to cover all of the concepts that are related
    to such an extraordinary IDE in one chapter of a book; I would recommend that
    you play with it and explore it further in order to learn how to use it in the
    best way possible. In the next chapter, we will talk about databases and ADO.NET.

  zh: Visual Studio是C#开发人员的必备工具；正确理解它将提高您的生产力。在本章中，我们讨论了与Visual Studio相关的各种概念，包括其项目和模板，不同的编辑器和窗口，以及其调试功能。我们还研究了断点、调用堆栈跟踪和监视窗口，以及如何利用这些来优化调试过程。之后，我们探讨了Git和GitHub与Visual
    Studio的集成。最后，我们谈到了Visual Studio中可用的不同重构功能。在一本书的一章中很难涵盖与这样一个非凡的集成开发环境相关的所有概念；我建议您尝试使用它并进一步探索，以便学会如何以最佳方式使用它。在下一章中，我们将讨论数据库和ADO.NET。

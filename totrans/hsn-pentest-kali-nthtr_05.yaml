    looking at the tools that are useful for gathering intelligence from a target
    host or network. The tools we will be encountering in this chapter will be those
    that tend to be deployed during the first phase of pentesting, with the potential
    to be deployed again during later phases.

- en: Before you can effectively deploy any tools used to break into a system or otherwise
    compromise it, you must learn whatever information you can about it. Depending
    on the amount of care you take and depth you need to go into, this process can
    take a short period of time or a considerable period of time. To accelerate this
    process, NetHunter provides a full range of tools designed just for this purpose.

- en: 'Since we don''t have a specific target in mind for this book, we will explore
    a range of tools designed to gather different types of information. We will assume
    that there is a good amount of information to be gathered about the target and
    we must simply deploy the right tools to get it. Keep in mind that, in the real
    world, you may be approached to perform a pentest using one of three popular approaches
    based on the client''s needs. With this in mind, let''s go over the three popular
    approaches to a pentest based on the amount of information that is provided or
    needs to be gathered:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**White box**: A term used to describe a test where complete information is
    provided to the tester prior to the start of the test and additional questions
    can be asked later. Typically, this test is used in situations where the client
    needs to perform an audit, and simulating an actual attack is not necessary.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Grey box**: In this type of test, limited information is provided to the
    tester in order to either guide the test or control the extent of the test. For
    example, a client may provide a list of server names and IP addresses which, if
    discovered, would be the point where you contact the client for further instructions
    on how to proceed.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Black box**: In this type of test, no information is provided and the attacker
    must gain all information on their own. This type of test most closely emulates
    the actual environment that an outside attacker would face, having to gain information
    along the way.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important that, before you engage in the test, that you understand the
    client's goals and the type of test that they want. For this book, we will assume
    that we are running a black box test and have to dig for and earn the information
    we need to proceed to later phases of the pentesting process.
  prefs: []

    but we will not be including them in this book. Instead, we will keep things simple

    a very real downside to having this much information available: you can get overwhelmed
    if you''re not careful. Once you have been testing long enough and are familiar
    with the types of information that can be revealed, you will learn what is more
    valuable.'

    Typically, you will find yourself, as a beginner, gathering far more information
    than you will actually use, while possibly missing some items that don't appear
    to be of much use. As you gain experience with the different actions that can
    be taken during pentesting, you will learn to recognize useful information, be
    it information that is immediately useful or that will be useful later.

    emulates many of the methods that are used to gain information from public sources,

    keywords creatively. Keywords can be any number of different items, but in this
    case, they typically are the name of the manufacturer and the device model number.
    In some cases, it could even be the name of an unusual device, such as an embedded
    device or an **Internet of Things** (**IoT**) gadget. Once you have an idea of
    keywords to use, you can use these within Shodan to search for devices. You can
    even refine your results if you get overwhelmed by utilizing filter commands.

    it has the ability to locate devices, such as named IoT objects. Basically, as

    everything you may want. Search engines only show a small fraction of the information
    available on the web and many take advantage of this shortcoming to keep things
    from showing up in a search engine. One of these ways is by tweaking a file known
    as `robots.txt`.

    the root of a website and comes into play when a robot or bot visits a site in
    an attempt to catalog content. A robot visits a website such as [www.sample.com](http://www.sample.com).
    However, before it does it checks for the existence of the `robots.txt` file.
    If the file exists, it reads the file to see whether it is allowed to proceed,
    and if so, where. In this case, let''s say that `robots.txt` is found in [www.sample.com/robots.txt](http://www.sample.com/robots.txt)

- en: A technical area we should also focus on is DNS, or Domain Name System, which
    is responsible for resolving hostnames to IPs and IPs to hostnames. This service
    is extremely common to find running on a network, and is essentially a required
    service within most environments.

- en: 'If you recall from your networking experience, DNS is a database that contains
    information about the relationships between IP addresses and corresponding hostnames.
    When a client wishes to obtain the IP address that goes with a given hostname
    (in a query known as a forward-lookup), a process goes on within DNS where the
    hostname is located in the database and the address returned. Each of these IP-to-hostname
    relationships in the database is known as a record. Not all records in DNS are
    the same and they exist as many different types, each leading to a different type
    of resource. Looking for the IP for a file server? That''s an A record. Looking
    for a mail server? That''s an MX record. The following table lists these different
    records:'

    nslookup comes in. Nslookup allows us to interact with a DNS server and query
    it for different record types. Executing queries to retrieve HINFO or TXT records
    can yield information such as notes or other details that may be useful to you.
    Additionally, retrieving other records, such as an MX record, could yield you
    the address of a mail server or an NS record could tell you the address of the
    target's DNS servers.

    ways in which core security aspects, such as authentication and authorization,
    use Spring Security. In doing so, we just skimmed over a very thin layer of the
    capabilities that can be achieved using Spring Security. In this chapter, we will
    cover some other capabilities provided by Spring Security in a concise manner.

    a product by giving a gist of the technical capability that we need to address,
    then introduce you briefly to the product.

    Spring Security can be used to achieve remember me, or persistent login, functionality.
    In the example that we are going to reuse, we have used basic authentication,
    in which user credentials are stored in a MySQL database.
  prefs: []

- en: Remember me functionality is achieved in Spring Security by sending cookies
    to the browser when the user chooses to remember his/her credentials on the client
    side. The cookie can be configured to be stored in the browser for a stipulated
    time. If the cookie exists and is valid, the next time the user accesses the application,
    they are taken straight to the user's home page and avoid explicit authentication
    with a username/password combination.

    form of API keys, other application passwords, and more. Often, for an application
    deployed and running in a production environment, keeping these in plain text
    can result in security breaches. With automation up for grabs quite cheaply nowadays,
    for modern applications, storing such data securely with access control and secure
    storage is a must.

    and helps in managing these secrets easily with very rigid controls. It provides
    APIs that give access based on set policies. It also has the capability to provide
    access control, and it also comes with encryption functionality out of box. In
    addition, it has a variety of persistent backend supports, such as Consul (from
    HashiCorp), and more, making it easy for enterprises to adopt it. Vault is written
    in Go and has binaries available for many platforms, and can be downloaded from
    its website. In this section, we will quickly run you through the Vault product
    itself, and then go through an example in which we will create a Spring Boot project
    and securely access some of the secrets stored in the Vault. Without further ado,
    let's get our hands dirty with actual code.

    allowing us to do so very easily and with minimal code. However, Spring Security
    is slowly and steadily catching up with many of the additional security features
    needed in modern applications. Most of these applications are deployed on the
    cloud and have very high rates of changes pushed to production on a day-to-day
    basis. **HTTP Data Integrity Validator** (**HDIV**) is a product that can be used
    to further enrich your application security.
  prefs: []

- en: What is HDIV?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HDIV was originally born as an open source project when it was developed by
    Roberto Velasco, Gotzon Illarramendi, and Gorka Vicente to confront security issues
    detected in production environments. The first stable Version 1.0 was released
    in 2008, in the form of a security library to be integrated within web applications.
    HDIV was officially integrated with Spring MVC, the most-used Java solution for
    web application development in 2011\. In 2012, HDIV was integrated with Grails.
    In 2015, HDIV was included within Spring Framework official documentation as a
    solution related to web security. Based on global interest and responding to high
    market demand, the creators founded the **HDIV Security **([https://hdivsecurity.com/](https://hdivsecurity.com/))
    company and launched the commercial version of HDIV in 2016\. HDIV solutions are
    built into applications during development to deliver the strongest available
    **Runtime Application Self Protection** (**RASP**) against the OWASP Top 10 threats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HDIV was born to protect applications against parameter-tampering attacks. Its
    first purpose (looking at the acronym) was to guarantee the integrity (no data
    modification) of all the data generated by the server (links, hidden fields, combo
    values, radio buttons, destiny pages, cookies, headers, and more). HDIV extends
    a web application's behavior by adding security functionalities, as well as maintaining
    the API and the framework specification. HDIV gradually incorporated capabilities
    such as CSRF, **SQL Injection** (**SQLi**), and XSS protection, thus offering
    greatly increased security and being more than just an HTTP data integrity validator.

    is becoming a costly bottleneck. Spring Security protects the application by easily
    implementing the most important security aspects, such as authentication and authorization,

    code. This is where integrating a Spring application that is already secured using
    Spring Security can bring in HDIV. We will be going through a very simple example,
    which will showcase a few of the areas where HDIV shines. Here are some of those
    advantages, as detailed by their website:'

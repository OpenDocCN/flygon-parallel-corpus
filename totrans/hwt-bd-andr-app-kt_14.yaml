    Android projects. It covers using the **MVVM** (**Model-View-ViewModel**) pattern,
    adding ViewModels, and using data binding. You will also learn about using the
    Repository pattern for caching data and WorkManager for scheduling data retrieval
    and storage.

- en: When developing an Android application, you might tend to write most of the
    code (including business logic) in activities or fragments. This would make your
    project hard to test and maintain later. As your project grows and becomes more
    complex, the difficulty will increase too. You can improve your projects with
    architectural patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Architectural patterns are general solutions for designing and developing parts
    of applications, especially for large apps. There are architectural patterns you
    can use to structure your project into different layers (the presentation layer,
    the **user interface** (**UI**) layer, and the data layer) or functions (observer/observable).
    With architectural patterns, you can organize your code in a way that makes it
    easier for you to develop, test, and maintain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Android development, commonly used patterns include **MVC** (**Model-View-Controller**),
    **MVP** (**Model-View-Presenter**), and MVVM. Google's recommended architectural
    pattern is MVVM, which will be discussed in this chapter. You will also learn
    about data binding, the Repository pattern using Room library, and WorkManager.

- en: MVVM
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: MVVM allows you to separate the UI and business logic. When you need to redesign
    the UI or update the Model/business logic, you only need to touch the relevant
    component without affecting the other components of your app. This will make it
    easier for you to add new features and test your existing code. MVVM is also useful
    in creating huge applications that use a lot of data and views.

    fragments, and layouts that your users see and interact are the Views in MVVM.
    Views only deal with how the app looks. They let the ViewModel know about user
    actions (such as opening an activity or clicking on a button).

    Model and transform them for display in the View. Views subscribe to the ViewModel

- en: 'In the previous chapter, you developed an app that can display a list of TV
    shows that are on the air. The app had two screens: the main screen and the details
    screen. On the main screen, there''s a list of TV shows. When clicking on a TV
    show, the details screen will be displayed with the details of the selected show.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When running the app, it takes a while to display the list of shows. Update
    the app to cache the list so it will be immediately displayed when opening the
    app. Also, improve the app by using MVVM with data binding and adding a WorkManager.

- en: 'This chapter focused on architectural patterns for Android. You started with
    the MVVM architectural pattern. You learned its three components: the Model, the
    View, and the ViewModel. You also used data binding to link the View with the
    ViewModel.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, you learned about how the Repository pattern can be used to cache data.
    Then, you learned about WorkManager and how you can schedule tasks such as retrieving
    data from the network and saving that data to the database to update your local
    data.

    apps with `CoordinatorLayout` and `MotionLayout`.

    moving parts and delightful animations in our apps to make them more lively and
    to make the UI and user experience better. For example, we can add visual cues
    so that the user will not be confused about what to do next and can be guided
    through what steps they can take. Animations while loading can entertain the user
    while content is being fetched or processed. Pretty animations when the app encounters
    an error can help prevent users from getting angry about what has happened and
    can inform them of what options they have.

    The enter transition defines how the activity and its views will be animated when

    and views are animated when the activity is closed or a new activity is opened.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This chapter covered creating animations and transitions with `CoordinatorLayout`
    and `MotionLayout`. Animations can improve the usability of our app and make it
    stand out compared to other apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We started by customizing the transition when opening and closing an activity
    with activity transitions. We also learned about adding shared element transitions
    when an activity and the activity that it opens both contain the same elements
    so that we can highlight this link between the shared elements to the users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We learned how we can use `CoordinatorLayout` to handle the motion of its child
    views. Some views have built-in behaviors that handle how they work inside `CoordinatorLayout`.
    You can add custom behaviors to other views too. Then, we moved on to using `MotionLayout`
    to create animations by specifying the start constraint, end constraint, and the
    transition between them. We also looked into modifying the motion path by adding
    keyframes in the middle of the animation. We learned about keyframes such as `KeyPosition`,
    which can change the view's position, and `KeyAttribute`, which can change the
    view's style. We also looked into using the Motion Editor in Android Studio to
    simplify the creation and previewing of animations and modifying the path.

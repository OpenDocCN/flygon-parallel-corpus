    and the entire release process. It covers creating a Google Play Developer account,
    setting up the store entry for our developed app, and creating a key store (including
    coverage of the importance of passwords and where to store files). We'll also
    learn about app bundles and APK, looking at how to generate the app's APK or AAB
    file. Later in the chapter, we'll set up release paths, open beta, and closed
    alpha, and finally we'll upload our app to the store and download it on a device.

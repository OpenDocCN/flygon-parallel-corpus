  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `RestTemplate` module is a port of the Java-based REST client `RestTemplate`,
    which initially appeared in 2009 in Spring for MVC. Like the other Spring template
    counterparts (`JdbcTemplate`, `JmsTemplate`, and so on), its aim is to bring to
    Java developers (and thus Android developers) a high-level abstraction of lower-level
    Java API; in this case, it eases the development of HTTP clients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In its Android version, `RestTemplate` relies on the core Java HTTP facilities
    (`HttpURLConnection`) or the Apache HTTP Client. According to the Android device
    version you use to run your app, `RestTemplate` for Android can pick the most
    appropriate one for you. This is according to Android developers' recommendations.

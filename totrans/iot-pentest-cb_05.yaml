- en: In consumer, and some commercial, IoT devices, there is an accompanied mobile
    application employed to fulfill a purpose. For instance, a mobile application
    may report analytical data to a server in a fleet management infrastructure, or
    the application may be given delegated control to start a car engine. In each
    case, data is likely stored in the mobile application and can be manipulated to
    perform unintended actions. To start discovering vulnerabilities and reverse engineering
    mobile applications, similar methodologies discussed in [Chapter 3](f0b26a31-570b-4a51-9519-cdfb567cb1cb.xhtml),
    *Analyzing and Exploiting* *Firmware *can also be applied to the mobile space.
    An application must first be acquired; afterwards, the application can be statically
    analyzed, dynamically analyzed, and can also be repackaged where applicable. This
    chapter will assist with assessing IoT mobile applications in an effort to exploit
    common vulnerabilities discovered in the field.

    box perspective. What is relevant from both the white and black box testing perspective
    is the **Mobile Application Security Verification Standard** (**MASVS**). The
    MASVS aimed to establish a framework of security requirements needed to design,
    develop, and test mobile applications for both iOS and Android ([https://www.owasp.org/images/f/fe/MASVS_v0.9.3.pdf](https://www.owasp.org/images/f/fe/MASVS_v0.9.3.pdf)).
    In addition, trends and patterns of common vulnerabilities that affect both Android
    and iOS applications have been identified and translated into a checklist created
    to accompany the MASVS, which testers as well as developers can follow when assessing
    an application ([https://www.owasp.org/images/1/1b/Mobile_App_Security_Checklist_0.9.3.xlsx](https://www.owasp.org/images/1/1b/Mobile_App_Security_Checklist_0.9.3.xlsx)).

    in progress but is at a mature stage. The MASVS and the checklist point out many
    potential vulnerabilities and the requirements for mitigation. Some of the most

    (native or hybrid) but are also introduced via poor coding practices. In this
    chapter, many of the common vulnerabilities listed will be demonstrated on both
    mobile platforms. Applying these methodologies and the checklist is outside of
    the scope of this book, however it is a good idea to use them as a reference when
    attacking IoT mobile applications. For simplicity, we will take the path of statically
    analyzing mobile applications then work towards dynamically analyzing the mobile
    applications during runtime. To get started, we need the target application binaries
    to start the process of testing an IoT mobile app.

    and installing the app for the target platform. Usually, if an IoT device has
    an Android app, there is also an iOS app available as well. To install an application
    for Android, Google Play Store is used, which also shares basic information about
    the app. For iOS applications, Apple's App Store is used to install an app to
    an iDevice. However, the raw application binaries are not made available and cannot
    be obtained via the Play Store or App Store. The application binaries or packages
    are known as Android packages or APK, and **iOS App Store Package Archive** (**IPA**)
    for iOS. If you happen to be testing an application from a white box perspective,
    these binaries will be given to you without the need of exploring ways to obtain
    the app binaries. If you are testing from a black box perspective for research
    purposes, you may be wondering how we are going to get our hands on the application
    binaries.

    files. However, there are some caveats to consider when using these third-party
    app stores. Sometimes, the app stores do not have an updated version of the app,
    or have an incorrect app altogether. It is important to verify the hash, version,
    and contents of the app prior to installation of the Play Store''s version. Some
    third-party app stores claim to have an app you are looking for but they end up
    being masked as spyware apps that require unnecessary permissions. The cool part
    about downloading Android apps from third-party app stores is the ability to download
    older versions of an application as well as their historical release notes. Select
    a third-party app store, such as [https://apps.evozi.com](https://apps.evozi.com)

    Apple provides. This leads to data leakage via clear text databases (including

    we notice an `access_token` being sent as a URL parameter in a `GET` request directed
    to an MP4 of the video (CVE-2017-6085). Copying this `GET` request to our clipboard
    and pasting it into a browser allows access to download the MP4 video without
    a username or password, as seen in the following images:'

- en: Remember, we did not input any username or password to download and watch this
    video. This shows that the doorbell manufacturer has access control issues for
    users and may indicate other holes in the product as well. For a video doorbell,
    accessing video feeds without credentials is a risk from a security and privacy
    perspective. Several vulnerabilities can be identified within this finding alone,
    which includes sending session tokens as `GET` requests, lack of token expiration,
    and insufficient access controls. An attacker may acquire the necessary `access_token`
    via social engineering or MITM techniques. Additional access control test cases
    can be performed with external user accounts as a follow-up to this finding.

    inside an emulator, virtual machine, and even a physical device. Dynamic testing
    for Android apps also includes testing intents and activities. There are some
    caveats that are listed in MobSF's wiki ([https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/2.-Configure-MobSF-Dynamic-Analysis-Environment-in-your-Android-Device-or-VM](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/wiki/2.-Configure-MobSF-Dynamic-Analysis-Environment-in-your-Android-Device-or-VM)).
    If the app you are testing requires access to hardware such as the camera or wireless
    protocol (that is, Bluetooth, ZigBee, or Z-Wave), it is recommended you use a
    physical device and test manually.

    the Java compiler executes sequentially. However, in certain cases, we might need
    to perform actions based on the current state of the program.

- en: Consider the example of the software that's installed in an ATM machine – it
    performs a set of actions, that is, it allows a transaction to occur when the
    PIN that's been entered by the user is correct. However, when the PIN that's been
    entered is incorrect, then the software performs another set of actions, that
    is, it informs the user that the PIN does not match and asks the user to reenter
    the PIN. You'll find that such logical constructs that depend upon values or stages
    are present in almost all real-world programs.

    and then the second `case`, the third `case`, and the `default` `case`. The `default`

    Java. Object-oriented programming allows us to explain highly complicated systems
    to the computer and also ourselves. In addition, there's a lot more to learn about
    object-oriented programming in terms of how objects fit together, the kinds of
    relationships they can have, and what we can do with objects to make our programs
    easier to write. We will also walk through the topics of creating custom classes,
    member variables, and member functions. Finally, we will look into a very special
    member assigned to our custom classes, that is, the constructor, and types of
    constructor.

- en: In this section, you'll take the first real steps of learning object-oriented
    programming in Java. So I guess the first question to ask is, "What is object-oriented
    programming?" Well, at a high level, object-oriented programming is the creation
    of objects, discrete code, and logic entities that are unique and separate from
    each other but can have complicated relationships.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When we write object-oriented code, we begin to deal with and think about the
    code as though it were a collection of physical pieces or objects. Java is by
    its very nature an object-oriented language. So, if you've been learning Java,
    at the very least, you've been using objects without realizing it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To see the power of object-oriented programming, take a look at the following
    program (`GettingObjectOriented.java`):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'This program is a very basic input/output program, the kind you''ve probably
    already written if you''ve been learning Java. In this program, we make use of
    a `Scanner` object that we call `reader`, and you''ll notice that we utilize `reader`
    on two lines: on one line, we declare and initialize `reader`, and on the other
    line, we call the `next()` function of `reader` to acquire some user input.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The important thing I'd like you to notice about the relationship between these
    two lines of code is that when we declare `reader`, we provide it with some additional
    information besides simply the command to create a new `Scanner` object. This
    is interesting because later when we utilize the `next()` function of `reader`,
    we won't have to retell it what stream it should be reading from; instead, this
    information is automatically stored and recalled by the `reader` object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is the beauty of object-oriented programming: the entities or objects
    we create can be constructed in such a way that not only do they know what to
    do with the information given to them and provide us with additional functionality,
    but also that they know exactly what information to ask to perform their later
    tasks.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's make sure we have our terminology straight. First, let's analyze the `new
    Scanner(System.in)` part of our code. This command tells Java to create a new
    object, a new `Scanner` object, for use in our program. This object has location
    and memory in which it lives, and this location is referenced by the `reader`
    variable. It would be possible for us to create multiple variables that all point
    toward the same `Scanner` object; however, in the context of this simple program,
    `reader` is our only entry point to the object's location in memory. So, we can
    often get away with referring to an object like this simply by its variable name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, different objects operate in a different manner. It is possible for
    us to create multiple `Scanner` objects; they would not have the same location
    in memory, but they would share similar functionality. The piece of code and logic
    that declares what functionality an object has and how that functionality operates
    is called the object's class. In this case, we're creating an object of the `Scanner`
    class and pointing to it with the `reader` variable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is all well and good, and we can create a whole lot of programs simply
    using the default standard libraries that Java provides; however, to really open
    the doors, we're going to need the ability to create custom classes of our own.
    Let's jump in and create one.

    class declaration code is a little different and logically discrete from something
    like the executed `main()` method, where the lines are executed one after another
    in order. Rather, the class we're going to create is going to serve more as a
    reference for the lines of code, such as the `Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);`
    code line. Generally, when working in an object-oriented language, a high-level
    object-oriented language such as Java, we simply put each and every new class
    we create in its own separate file.

    Remember, these member variables are unique to each instance of a `Person` object,

    Java considers it a little special.

    Creating a new person is as simple as creating a new `Scanner` object. We use

    Now `john` already has some basic functionality just by the fact that we've declared
    some member variables for the `Person` class, so even our rudimentary declaration
    of the `Person` class has given John some member variables that we can work with.

    `firstName` and `lastName` by the time we reach this point. While strings are
    technically classes in Java, Java also gives them the special privilege of being
    able to be assigned to an explicit value or a string explicit. Calendars, of course,
    don't have this unique special privilege, so we're going to need to create a new
    `Calendar` object to place within our object, that is, `john`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, `Calendar` is one of those classes that we can assign instances of; however,
    when we want to create a brand new one, we would need to create something more
    specific that is also a calendar. So, for this instance, we'll use `GregorianCalendar`.
    Then, let's assign `birthday` to `john`, say, `1988,1,5`. Then, to see that everything
    is being assigned as expected, simply print out John's first and last names.

    people with some more functionality. So, the beauty of object-oriented Java is
    that we're already beginning to think about instances of our `Person` class as
    physical objects. This makes anticipating the questions that will be asked of
    them much easier.

    a string called `fullName` that people could just ask of rather than having to
    individually acquire their first and last names?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, of course, simply adding another member variable like this is unwieldy
    because the people creating a new instance of `Person` will need to set `fullName`.
    Also, if the person's first name, last name, or full name were to ever change,
    their `fullName`, `firstName`, and `lastName` variable might not match up properly.

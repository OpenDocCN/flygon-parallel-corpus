- en: How often have you ended up writing code that spawns a new process? Not often.
    However, there may have been situations that necessitated the writing of such
    code. In such cases, you had to resort to using a third-party API such as **Apache
    Commons Exec** ([https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-exec/](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-exec/)),
    among others. Why was this? Wasn't the Java API sufficient? No, it wasn't; at
    least not until Java 9\. Now, with Java 9 and above, we have many more features
    added to the process API.

    With Java 7, new APIs were introduced, which allowed the redirecting of the input,
    output, and error to other processes (pipe), to a file, or to a standard input/output.
    Then, in Java 8, a few more APIs were introduced. In Java 9, there are now new
    APIs for the following areas:'

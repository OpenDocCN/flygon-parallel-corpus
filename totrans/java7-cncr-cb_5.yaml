- en: Normally, when you implement a simple, concurrent Java application, you implement
    some `Runnable` objects and then the corresponding `Thread` objects. You control
    the creation, execution, and status of those threads in your program. Java 5 introduced
    an improvement with the `Executor` and `ExecutorService` interfaces and the classes
    that implement them (for example, the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Executor framework separates the task creation and its execution. With it,
    you only have to implement the `Runnable` objects and use an `Executor` object.
    You send the `Runnable` tasks to the executor and it creates, manages, and finalizes
    the necessary threads to execute those tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java 7 goes a step further and includes an additional implementation of the
    `ExecutorService` interface oriented to a specific kind of problem. It's the **Fork/Join
    framework** .

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This framework is designed to solve problems that can be broken into smaller
    tasks using the divide and conquer technique. Inside a task, you check the size
    of the problem you want to resolve and, if it''s bigger than an established size,
    you divide it in smaller tasks that are executed using the framework. If the size
    of the problem is smaller than the established size, you solve the problem directly
    in the task and then, optionally, it returns a result. The following diagram summarizes
    this concept:'

- en: There is no formula to determine the reference size of a problem that determines
    if a task is subdivided or not, depending on its characteristics. You can use
    the number of elements to process in the task and an estimation of the execution
    time to determine the reference size. Test different reference sizes to choose
    the best one to your problem. You can consider `ForkJoinPool` as a special kind
    of `Executor`.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main difference between the Fork/Join and the Executor frameworks is the
    **work-stealing** algorithm. Unlike the Executor framework, when a task is waiting
    for the finalization of the subtasks it has created using the join operation,
    the thread that is executing that task (called **worker thread** ) looks for other
    tasks that have not been executed yet and begins its execution. By this way, the
    threads take full advantage of their running time, thereby improving the performance
    of the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To achieve this goal, the tasks executed by the Fork/Join framework have the
    following limitations:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tasks can only use the `fork()` and `join()` operations as synchronization mechanisms.
    If they use other synchronization mechanisms, the worker threads can't execute
    other tasks when they are in the synchronization operation. For example, if you
    put a task to sleep in the Fork/Join framework, the worker thread that is executing
    that task won't execute another one during the sleeping time.

    It provides the mechanisms to execute the `fork()` and `join()` operations inside
    a task and the methods to control the status of the tasks. Usually, to implement
    your Fork/Join tasks, you will implement a subclass of two subclasses of this
    class: `RecursiveAction` for tasks with no return result and `RecursiveTask` for
    tasks that return one.'

- en: In this example, you have created a `ForkJoinPool` object and a subclass of
    the `ForkJoinTask` class that you execute in the pool. To create the `ForkJoinPool`
    object, you have used the constructor without arguments, so it will be executed
    with its default configuration. It creates a pool with a number of threads equal
    to the number of processors of the computer. When the `ForkJoinPool` object is
    created, those threads are created and they wait in the pool until some tasks
    arrive for their execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the `Task` class doesn't return a result, it extends the `RecursiveAction`
    class. In the recipe, you have used the recommended structure for the implementation
    of the task. If the task has to update more than 10 products, it divides those
    set of elements into two blocks, creates two tasks, and assigns a block to each
    task. You have used the `first` and `last` attributes in the `Task` class to know
    the range of positions that this task has to update in the list of products. You
    have used the `first` and `last` attributes to use only one copy of the products
    list and not create different lists for each task.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To execute the subtasks that a task creates, it calls the `invokeAll()` method.
    This is a synchronous call, and the task waits for the finalization of the subtasks
    before continuing (potentially finishing) its execution. While the task is waiting
    for its subtasks, the worker thread that was executing it takes another task that
    was waiting for execution and executes it. With this behavior, the Fork/Join framework
    offers a more efficient task management than the `Runnable` and `Callable` objects
    themselves.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `invokeAll()` method of the `ForkJoinTask` class is one of the main differences
    between the Executor and the Fork/Join framework. In the Executor framework, all
    the tasks have to be sent to the executor, while in this case, the tasks include
    methods to execute and control the tasks inside the pool. You have used the `invokeAll()`
    method in the `Task` class, that extends the `RecursiveAction` class that extends
    the `ForkJoinTask` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have sent a unique task to the pool to update all the list of products using

- en: When you execute `ForkJoinTask` in `ForkJoinPool`, you can do it in a synchronous
    or asynchronous way. When you do it in a synchronous way, the method that sends
    the task to the pool doesn't return until the task sent finishes its execution.
    When you do it in an asynchronous way, the method that sends the task to the executor
    returns immediately, so the task can continue with its execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should be aware of a big difference between the two methods. When you use
    the synchronized methods, the task that calls one of these methods (for example,
    the `invokeAll()` method) is suspended until the tasks it sent to the pool finish
    their execution. This allows the `ForkJoinPool` class to use the work-stealing
    algorithm to assign a new task to the worker thread that executed the sleeping
    task. On the contrary, when you use the asynchronous methods (for example, the
    `fork()` method), the task continues with its execution, so the `ForkJoinPool`
    class can't use the work-stealing algorithm to increase the performance of the
    application. In this case, only when you call the `join()` or `get()` methods
    to wait for the finalization of a task, the `ForkJoinPool` class can use that
    algorithm.

- en: The `ForkJoinTask` class provides the `cancel()` method that allows you to cancel
    a task if it hasn't been executed yet. This is a very important point. If the
    task has begun its execution, a call to the `cancel()` method has no effect. The
    method receives a parameter as a `Boolean` value called `mayInterruptIfRunning`.
    This name may make you think that, if you pass the `true` value to the method,
    the task will be canceled even if it is running. The Java API documentation specifies
    that, in the default implementation of the `ForkJoinTask` class, this attribute
    has no effect. The tasks are only canceled if they haven't started their execution.
    The cancelation of a task has no effect over the tasks that this task sent to
    the pool. They continue with their execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A limitation of the Fork/Join framework is that it doesn't allow the cancelation
    of all the tasks that are in `ForkJoinPool`. To overcome that limitation, you
    have implemented the `TaskManager` class. It stores all the tasks that have been
    sent to the pool. It has a method that cancels all the tasks it has stored. If
    a task can't be canceled because it's running or it has finished, the `cancel()`
    method returns the `false` value, so you can try to cancel all the tasks without
    being afraid of possible collateral effects.
  prefs: []

- en: In the example, you have implemented a task that looks for a number in an array
    of numbers. You divide the problem into smaller sub-problems as the Fork/Join
    framework recommends. You are only interested in one occurrence of the number

- en: Java 8, released on March 8, 2014, brought arguably two of the most significant
    features since Java 5, released in 2004--lambdas and streams. With functional
    programming gaining popularity in the JVM world, especially with the help of languages
    such as Scala, Java adherents had been clamoring for more functional-style language
    features for several years. Originally slated for release in Java 7, the feature
    was dropped from that release, finally seeing a stable release with Java 8.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it can be hoped that everyone is familiar with Java's lambda support,
    experience has shown that many shops, for a variety of reasons, are slow to adopt
    new language versions and features, so a quick introduction might be helpful.

    Church in 1936, simply refers to an anonymous function. Typically, a function
    (or method, in more proper Java parlance), is a statically-named artifact in the
    Java source:'

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This abbreviated syntax indicates that we have a function that takes two parameters
    and returns their sum. Depending on where this lambda is used, the types of the
    parameters can be inferred by the compiler, making the second, even more concise
    format possible. Most importantly, though, note that this method is no longer
    named. Unless it is assigned to a variable or passed as a parameter (more on this
    later), it can not be referenced--or used--anywhere in the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This example, of course, is absurdly simple. A better example of this might
    be in one of the many APIs where the method''s parameter is an implementation
    of what is known as a **Single Abstract Method** (**SAM**) interface, which is,
    at least until Java 8, an interface with a single method. One of the canonical
    examples of a SAM is `Runnable`. Here is an example of the pre-lambda `Runnable`
    usage:'

    as is the case in many other languages, can also be assigned to variables and
    passed as parameters (indeed, the functionality would be almost worthless without
    this capability). Revisiting the `Runnable` method in the preceding code, we can
    separate the declaration and the use of `Runnable` as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This is intentionally more verbose than the preceding example. The stubbed out
    body of the `Runnable` method is intended to mimic, after a fashion, how a real-world
    `Runnable` may look and why one may want to assign the newly-defined `Runnable`
    method to a variable in spite of the conciseness that lambdas offer. This new
    lambda syntax allows us to declare the body of the `Runnable` method without having
    to worry about method names, signatures, and so on. It is true that any decent
    IDE would help with this kind of boilerplate, but this new syntax gives you, and
    the countless developers who will maintain your code, much less noise to have
    to parse when debugging the code.

    code more concise, but it also reduces the level of effort, such as it is, in
    creating some of these concrete SAM instances. That is to say, rather than having
    to decide between an anonymous class and a concrete, named class, the developer
    can declare it inline, cleanly and concisely.

    is the new **Streams API**. If you were to search for a definition of Java streams,
    you would get answers that range from the somewhat circular **a stream of data
    elements** to the more technical **Java streams are monads**, and they're probably
    both right. The Streams API allows the Java developer to interact with a stream
    of data elements via a **sequence of steps**. Even putting it that way isn't as
    clear as it could be, so let's see what it means by looking at some sample code.

    in Java knows the pain of `java.util.Calendar` and company. Clearly, you can get
    your work done, but it''s not always pretty. Many developers found the API too
    painful to use, so they integrated the extremely popular Joda Time library into
    their projects. The Java architects agreed, and engaged Joda Time''s author, Stephen
    Colebourne, to lead JSR 310, which brought a version of Joda Time (fixing various
    design flaws) to the platform. We''ll take a detailed look at how to use some

    language feature: default methods. Since the beginning of Java, an interface was
    used to define how a class looks, implying a certain type of behavior, but was
    unable to implement that behavior. This made polymorphism much simpler in a lot
    of cases, as any number of classes could implement a given interface, and the
    consuming code treats them as that interface, rather than whatever concrete class
    they actually are.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the problems that have confronted API developers over the years, though,
    was how to evolve an API and its interfaces without breaking existing code. For
    example, take the `ActionSource` interface from the JavaServer Faces 1.1 specification.
    When the JSF 1.2 expert group was working on the next revision of the specification,
    they identified the need to add a new property to the interface, which would result
    in two new methods--the getters and setters. They could not simply add the methods
    to the interface, as that would break every implementation of the specification,
    requiring the maintainers of the implementation to update their classes. Obviously,
    this sort of breakage is unacceptable, so JSF 1.2 introduced `ActionSource2`,
    which extends `ActionSource` and adds the new methods. While this approach is
    considered ugly by many, the 1.2 expert group had a few choices, and none of them
    were very good.

    and `sayGoodbye()`, to save our users a little time. However, as discussed earlier,
    if we just add these new methods to the interface, we''ll break our users'' code
    as soon as they update to the new version of the library. Default methods allow

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite being a solid, feature-packed release, Java 8 was considered by a fair
    number to be a bit disappointing. It lacked the much anticipated **Java Platform
    Module System** (**JPMS**), also known more colloquially, though not quite accurately,
    as Project Jigsaw. The Java Platform Module System was originally slated to ship
    with Java 7 in 2011, but it was deferred to Java 8 due to some lingering technical
    concerns. Project Jigsaw was started not only to finish the module system, but
    also to modularize the JDK itself, which would help Java SE scale down to smaller
    devices, such as mobile phones and embedded systems. Jigsaw was scheduled to ship
    with Java 8, which was released in 2014, but it was deferred yet again, as the
    Java architects felt they still needed more time to implement the system correctly.
    At long last, though, Java 9 will finally deliver this long-promised project.

- en: That said, what exactly is it? One problem that has long haunted API developers,
    including the JDK architects, is the inability to hide implementation details
    of public APIs. A good example from the JDK of private classes that developers
    should not be using directly is the `com.sun.*/sun.*` packages and classes. A
    perfect example of this--of private APIs finding widespread public use--is the
    `sun.misc.Unsafe` class. Other than a strongly worded warning in Javadoc about
    not using these internal classes, there's little that could be done to prevent
    their use. Until now.

    so that they may be easily used inside their projects, but not expose them outside
    the module, meaning they are not exposed to consumers of the API or library. To
    do this, the Java architects have introduced a new file, `module-info.java`, similar
    to the existing `package-info.java` file, found at the root of the module, for
    example, at `src/main/java/module-info.java`. It is compiled to `module-info.class`,
    and is available at runtime via reflection and the new `java.lang.Module` class.

    and `impl`. We want to expose the models and the API classes, but not any of the

    the project will not build, and if it is not available at runtime, the system
    will throw an exception and exit. Note that the `requires` statement does not
    specify a version. This is intentional, as it was decided not to tackle the version-selection
    issue as part of the module system, leaving that to more appropriate systems,
    such as build tools and containers.

    If you access your mail from more than one location (that is, from more than one
    desktop or mobile app), managing your email rules can be trickier still. If your
    mail system doesn't support rules stored on the server, you're left deciding where
    to put the rules so that they'll run most often. With this project, we'll develop
    an application that will allow us to author a variety of rules and then run them
    via an optional background process to keep your mail properly curated at all times.

    In Java 9, these were augmented with improved support for the TIFF specification.
    In this chapter, we'll exercise this API in creating an image/photo management
    application. We'll add support for importing images from user-specified locations
    into the configured official directory. We'll also revisit the duplicate file
    finder and reuse some of the code developed as a part of the project to help us
    identify duplicate images.

    hottest trends these days. It is an application/deployment model where a small
    function is deployed to a service that manages almost every aspect of the function--startup,
    shutdown, memory, and so on, freeing the developer from worrying about such details.
    In this chapter, we'll write a simple serverless Java application to see how it
    might be done, and how you might use this new technique for your own applications.

    synchronization in the background, if desired. We will also build the related
    components on the desktop--a graphical application to configure and monitor the
    process from the desktop as well as a background process to handle the synchronization
    from the desktop side.

    development tools, so we have much to choose from. The most fundamental choice
    facing us is the build tool. For our work here, we will be using Maven. While
    there is a strong and vocal community that would advocate Gradle, Maven seems
    to be the most common build tool at the moment, and seems to have more robust,
    mature, and native support from the major IDEs. If you do not have Maven already
    installed, you can visit [http://maven.apache.org](http://maven.apache.org/) and
    download the distribution for your operating system, or use whatever package management
    system is supported by your OS.

    free and open source IDE from Oracle. There are, of course, proponents of both
    IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse, and they're both fine choices, but NetBeans offers
    a complete and robust development out-of-the-box, and it's fast, stable, and free.
    To download NetBeans, visit [http://netbeans.org](http://netbeans.org/) and download
    the appropriate installer for your operating system. Since we are using Maven,
    which IDEA and Eclipse both support, you should be able to open the projects presented
    here in the IDE of your choice. Where steps are shown in the GUI, though, you
    will need to adjust for the IDE you've chosen.

    on Java 9, but, as it is a development version, it can be unstable from time to

    and Project Jigsaw, the process handling APIs, the new concurrency changes, and
    the new Java REPL. For each, we've discussed the what and why, and looked at some
    examples of how these might affect the systems we write. We've also taken a look

    is different, so it is not possible to write this book in such a way that you
    can simply copy and paste large swathes of code into your project. Similarly,
    every developer writes code differently; the way I structure my code may be vastly
    different from yours. It is important, then, that you keep that in mind when reading
    this book and not get hung up on the details. The purpose here is not to show
    you the one right way to use these APIs, but to give you an example that you can
    look at to get a better sense of how they might be used. Learn what you can from
    each example, modify things as you see fit, and go build something amazing.

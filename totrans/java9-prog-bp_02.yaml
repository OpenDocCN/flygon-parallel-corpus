    some of these new APIs in a practical manner. We'll start with a simple process

    These modules are part of the standard JDK as of Java 9, so that shouldn''t be
    an issue. However, that may change in future versions of Java, and this module
    declaration will help prevent runtime failures in our application by forcing the
    host JVM to provide the module or fail to start. It is also possible to build

    method returns **a snapshot of all processes visible to the current process**.
    From each `ProcessHandle` in the stream, we can get information about the process
    ID, its state, children, parents, and so on. Each `ProcessHandle` also has a nested
    object, `Info`, that contains a snapshot of information about the process. Since
    not all information is available across the various supported platforms and it
    is limited by the privileges of the current process, the properties on the `Info`
    object are the `Optional<T>` instances, indicating that the values may or may
    not be set. It's probably worth the time to take a quick look at what `Optional<T>`

    which does as its name implies--it shows the dialog and waits for the user''s
    response. It returns `Optional<ButtonType>`, which holds the type of the button
    that the user clicked on, which will either be `ButtonType.YES` or `ButtonType.NO`,
    given the type of `Alert` box we''ve created. With `Optional`, we can apply `filter()`
    to find only the type of button that we''re interested in, which is `ButtonType.YES`,
    the result of which is another `Optional`. If the user clicked on yes, `ifPresent()`
    will return true (thanks to our filter), and the lambda we passed in will be executed.

    user would like to kill a process, we need to identify **which** process to kill.
    To do that, we ask `TableView` which row is selected via `TableView.getSelectionModel()
    .getSelectedItem()`. We do need to check for null (alas, there's no `Optional`
    here) in the event that the user has not actually selected a row. If it is non-null,
    we can call `destroy()` on the `ProcessHandle` the `TableView` gives us. We then
    call `processListUpdater.updateList()` to refresh the UI. We'll take a look at
    that later.

    Unfortunately, the dialog doesn't support the builder pattern, meaning we don't
    have a nice, fluid API to build the dialog, so we do it in several discrete steps.
    Processing `Optional` is also similar. We call `ifPresent()` to see if the dialog
    returned a command line (that is, the user entered some text **and** pressed OK),
    and pass that to the lambda if present.

- en: Let's take a quick look at the lambda. This is another example of a multiline
    lambda. Whereas most lambdas we've seen so far have been simple, one-line functions,
    remember that a lambda **can** span multiple lines. All that needs to be done
    to support that is to wrap the block in curly braces as we've done, and it's business
    as usual. Care must be taken with multiline lambdas like this, as any gains in
    readability and conciseness that lambdas give us can be quickly obscured or erased
    by a lambda body that grows too large. In those instances, extracting the code
    out to a method and using a method reference might be the wise thing to do. Ultimately,
    the decision is yours, but remember the words of Uncle Bob Martin--*Clarity is
    king*.

    A system can be single or multithreaded, depending on the needs and runtime environment
    of the system. And multithreaded programming is hard to get right. Luckily, our
    use case here is fairly simple, but we must still exercise caution, or we'll see

    since you''re not tied to a concrete base class (`Runnable` is an `interface`).
    In our case, however, we have a relatively simple system that has little to gain
    from that approach, so we''ll extend `Thread` directly and simplify our code a

    `Thread.suspend`, and `Thread.resume` deprecated? If you would like more details;
    however, the suggested best practice now is to use a control flag, like we've
    done with `running`, to signal to the `Thread` class that it needs to clean up

    processes, updates `ObservableList` we discussed earlier, and then instructs `TableView`
    to re-sort itself, based on the user''s sort selection, if any. This is a public

- en: The eagle-eyed will notice that `updateList()` has the `synchronized` keyword
    on it. This is to prevent any sort of race condition that might be caused by calling
    this method from multiple threads. Imagine the scenario where the user decides
    to kill a process and clicks on OK on the confirmation dialog at the exact moment
    the thread wakes up (this type of thing happens more often than you might think).
    We could conceivably have two threads calling `updateList()` at the same time,
    resulting in the first thread hitting `processView.sort()` just as the second
    is hitting `processList.setAll()`. What happens when `sort()` is called while
    another thread is rebuilding the list? It's hard to say for sure, but it could
    be catastrophic, so we want to disallow that. The `synchronized` keyword instructs
    the JVM to allow only one thread to execute the method at a time, causing all
    others to queue up, waiting their turn (note that their execution order is non-deterministic,
    so you can't base any expectations on the order in which threads get to run a
    `synchronized` method). This avoids the potential for a race condition, and ensures
    that our program doesn't crash.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While appropriate here, care must be taken with `synchronized` methods, as acquiring
    and releasing the locks can be expensive (though much less so with modern JVMs)
    and, more importantly, it forces threads to run sequentially when they hit this
    method call, which can cause a very undesirable lag in the application, especially
    in GUI applications. Keep that in mind when writing your own multithreaded applications.

    new, and we're going to give this project a name, something that might be a bit
    more appealing than the dry, albeit accurate, `description-turned-name` that we've
    used to date. This application, then, we'll call Sunago, which is the phonetic
    spelling of the (Koine) Greek word συνάγω, which means **I gather together**,
    **collect**, **assemble**.

    of the accordion on the left, select Wrap in, and then VBox, as shown in the preceding
    screenshot. Scene Builder will then modify the FXML file, making AnchorPane a
    child of VBox as expected. Once that's done, you can right-click on AnchorPane,

    user interface that's more boring than it was when we began. We can fix that now
    by adding a couple of controls--a MenuBar and a ListView. We do that by clicking
    on each component in the Controls section of the accordion and dragging them to
    VBox. If you drop the components on VBox, they will be appended to its list of

    case here. It's a scenario that some consider to be unacceptable, and they may
    have a point, but it's really a question of trade-offs. Our options include a
    slightly bloated interface or a complex system in which each network support module
    (which we'll get to shortly) provides its own renderer, and the application has
    to interrogate each module, looking for the renderer that can handle each item
    while drawing `ListView`. There are likely others, of course, but faced with (at
    least) those two, for the sake of simplicity and performance, we'll take the first
    option. When faced with similar situations while designing your own systems, though,
    you'll need to evaluate the various requirements of your project, and make an
    appropriate choice. For our needs here, the simple approach is more than adequate.

    the screen. Notice that we check to see if `item` is null. We do that because
    `ListView` calls this method not for every item in its `List`, but for every row
    in `ListView` that's visible, whether there's data for it or not. That means that,
    if `List` has five items but `ListView` is tall enough to show ten rows, this
    method will be called ten times, with the last five calls being made with a null
    `item`. In those cases, we call `setGraphic(null)` to clear out any item that
    may have been previously rendered.

    social media network icon (so users can tell at a glance where the item is from),
    any image embedded in the item, and, finally, any text/caption from the item.
    To help arrange that, we start with an `HBox`.

    up, we would include language in it that would stipulate that the module include
    a file called `icon.png`, which is in the same package as the module's `SocialMediaItem`
    implementation. Using the `ClassLoader` for the implementation, then, we try to
    get an `InputStream` for the resource. We check for null, just to make sure the
    image was actually found; if so, we create an `ImageView`, set some properties,
    then wrap the resource in an `Image`, hand that to `ImageView`, then add `ImageView`
    to `HBox`.

    around the image (via `picture.setPadding(new Insets()`) to give this image some
    space between it and the network icon.

    our `HBox`, which we then return to the caller, `updateItem()`.

    can't have a complex `ListCell` structure like we have here without implementing
    `ListCell` yourself. If you're planning on doing much JavaFX development, you

    second one. We want to give our tab a meaningful label. We can do that by double-clicking
    on the tab in the preview window (or selecting the Text property in the Properties
    section of the Inspector) and typing `General`. Finally, expand the Inspector's
    Code section, and enter `tabPane` for fx:id.

    save or discard changes. We implement that by dragging a ButtonBar component to
    our border pane's BOTTOM area. That will add a ButtonBar with one button, but
    we need two, so we drag another button on to the ButtonBar. The nice thing about
    this control is that it will handle button placement and padding for us, so, when
    we drop the new button, it's automatically added in the proper place on the right.
    (This behavior can be overridden, but it works exactly how we want it to, so we
    can just accept the defaults.)
  prefs: []

    The first property is in the Properties section of the inspector, and the last
    two in the Code section. The values for the first button are `Save`, `savePrefs`,
    and `savePreferences`. For the second button, the values are `Cancel`, `cancel`,
    and `closeDialog`. Select the Layout section for the `ButtonBar` in the inspector,

    and use AnchorPane to demonstrate this feature of Scene Builder. If you drag a
    TextField onto TabPane and try to position it, you should see more red lines show
    up. Positioned just right, you should see a red line running through the middle
    of the Label and the `TextField`, indicating that the two components are vertically

    any preference storing strategy that you can image. Fortunately, though, it also
    offers a couple of different standard APIs that allow you to do so in a more easily
    portable manner, those being `Preferences` and `Properties`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `java.util.Properties` class has been in the JDK since version 1.0, and
    while its basic, no-frills API might make that obvious, it's still a very useful
    abstraction. At its heart, `Properties` is a `Hashtable` implementation to which
    methods have been added for loading its data from input streams and readers, and
    writing its data to output streams and writers (in addition to a handful of other
    related methods). All the properties are treated as `String` values with `String`
    keys. Since `Properties` is a `Hashtable`, you can still use `put()` and `putAll()`
    to store non-string data, but that will result in `ClassCastException` should
    you call `store()`, so, it's probably best to avoid doing that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `java.util.prefs.Preferences` class was added in Java 1.4, and it's a much
    more modern API. Whereas with properties we have to handle persistence separately,
    preferences handle that for us opaquely--we don't need to worry about how or when
    it's written. In fact, the call to set a preference may return immediately, while
    the actual persistence may not occur for quite some time. The contract of the
    `Preferences` API guarantees that preferences will be persisted even if the JVM
    shuts down, assuming it's a normal, ordered shutdown (by definition, there's not
    much that can be done if the JVM process suddenly dies).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, the user also need not worry about how preferences are saved.
    The actual backing store is an implementation-specific detail. It could be a flat
    file, an OS-specific registry, a database or some sort of directory server. For
    the curious, the actual implementation is chosen by using the class name, if specified,
    in the `java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory` system property. If that's not defined,
    the system will look for the file `META-INF/services/java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory`
    (a mechanism known as SPI, which we will look at in depth later), and use the
    first class defined there. Finally, failing that, the implementation for the underlying
    platform is loaded and used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So which to choose? Either will work as well as the other, but you have to decide
    if you want control of where the information is stored (`Properties`) or ease
    of implementation (`Preferences`). To a certain degree, portability might also
    be a concern. For example, if you have Java code running in some sort of a mobile
    or embedded device, you might not have permissions to write to the filesystem,
    and you might not have a filesystem at all. To show how similar the two implementations
    might be, though, we'll implement both.

    in our previous example) defines and publishes an interface. Ideally, this system
    would provide a default implementation, but that's not necessary in all cases.
    Any interested third party could then implement this interface, register it, and
    the target system could then load and use it. One of the advantages of this approach
    is that the target system can be extended easily, with no coupling to the third
    party. That is to say, while the third party knows about the target system via
    the interface, the target system has no knowledge at all of the third party. It's
    merely operating off the interface it defined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How are these third-party plugins registered with the target system? The third-party
    developer would create a text file using a specific file in a specific directory.
    The file has the same name as the interface being implemented. For the `Preferences`
    class example, one would be implementing the `java.util.prefs.PreferencesFactory`
    interface, so that would be the name of the file, which would be in the `META-INF/services`
    directory in the root of the libraries classpath. In a Maven-based project, the
    file would be found in `src/main/resources/META-INF/services`. The file contains
    just the name of the class implementing the interface. It's also possible to have
    more than one class listed in the services file, each on a new line. It's up to
    the consuming system, though, as to whether or not each of those might be used.

    If, say, the file doesn't exist (as it won't be the first time this class is created),
    an `Exception` will be thrown, and `input` will be null. If it's not null, we

    We use the `ServiceLoader.load()` method to ask the system for any implementations

    that it won't pick up **any** implementation in the system, but **only** those

    There is a chance here for a `NullPointerException` since we are returning `null`,
    but we're also providing an implementation, so we avoid that risk. However, in

    social networks. Technically, as we'll soon see, the **network** need not even
    be social as the only thing that will imply a specific type of source is the name
    of the classes and interfaces involved. However, we will, in fact, focus on social
    networks, and we'll use a couple of different ones to show some variety. To that

    Instagram, the increasingly photo-focused network that is now part of Facebook.

    that Facebook offers make it virtually impossible to integrate with it in a way
    that would be of interest here. For example, the permission to read a user's home
    timeline (or wall) is only granted to applications targeted at those platforms
    where Facebook is not currently available, and not at all to desktop applications,

    truly finished?). However, while you will see a reasonably complete API, a word
    of caution--attempts to create an abstraction that start with that abstraction--that
    is, writing the abstraction from scratch--rarely end well. It is usually best
    to write a specific implementation to get a better understanding of the details
    required, then extract an abstraction. What you will see here is the end result

- en: We start by getting a list of the jar files (we'll see that code in a moment),
    then, if the array is non-null, we need to build an array of `URL`s, so, we iterate
    over the `File` array, and call `.toURI().toURL()` to do so. Once we have our
    `URL` array we create a new `ClassLoader` (`URLClassLoader.newInstance(urls)`),
    then set the `ClassLoader` for the current Thread via `Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader()`.

    that ends with `.jar`. A list of zero or more jar files is returned to our calling
    code for inclusion in the new `ClassLoader`, and our work is done.

- en: So there you have two ways of adding plugin jars to the runtime dynamically.
    Each has its strengths and weaknesses. The first requires multi-platform development
    and maintenance, while the second is a bit riskier, as classloaders can be tricky.
    I have tested the second approach on Windows and Linux and Java 8 and 9 with no
    errors detected. Which approach you use will, of course, depend on your unique
    environment and requirements, but you have at least two options with which to
    start your evaluation.

    is truly complete, and there's much more that could be done to Sunago. Twitter
    support could be expanded to include direct messages. The Instagram module needs
    some configuration options added. While the capabilities exposed via the Facebook
    API are limiting, some sort of meaningful Facebook integration could be added.
    Sunago itself could be modified to, say, add support for in-application viewing
    of social media content (as opposed to shelling out to the host operating system's
    default browser). There are a handful of minor user experience bugs that could
    be addressed. And the list can go on and on. What we do have, though, is a moderately
    complex, networked application, that demonstrates a number of features and capabilities
    of the Java platform. We've built an extensible, internationalized JavaFX application
    that demonstrates the use of the Service Provider Interface and `ClassLoader`
    magic, and offers many more examples of lambdas, stream operations, and functional
    interfaces.

    given that most people are familiar with the topic at this point, I think it would

    as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services in which each
    service runs a unique process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight
    mechanism to serve a business goal.

    several related systems in one web application and deploying it to a large application
    server, such as GlassFish/Payara Server, Wildfly, WebLogic Server, or WebSphere,
    each of these systems would instead be run separately in their own JVM process.
    The benefits of this approach include easier, piecemeal upgrades, increased stability
    through process isolation, smaller resource requirements, greater machine utilization,
    and so on. The concept itself is not necessarily new, but it has certainly gained
    popularity in recent years, and continues to grow at a rapid pace.

    we have a myriad of choices, which is almost always good. Since we can only build
    using one, I have chosen to use the MicroProfile. Specifically, we'll base our
    application on Payara Micro, Payara's implementation, which is based on the GlassFish
    sources (plus Payara's bug fixes, enhancements, and so on).

    is the relational database. It is a tried and true choice that powers a wide swath
    of the industry. They are, however, not without their limitations and problems.
    While databases themselves can be complicated in terms of classifications and
    functionality, perhaps the most popular alternatives to relational databases are
    NoSQL databases. While these have existed for half a century, the idea had not
    gained any significant market traction until sometime in the last decade or so

    tend to be key-value, document, or graph data stores, each offering distinct performance
    and behavior characteristics. A full treatment of each type of NoSQL database
    and its various implementations is beyond the scope of this book, so, in the interest
    of time and space, we'll just get straight to our selection--MongoDB. Its scalability
    and flexibility, especially in regard to document schemas, meshes well with our

    only is it a very powerful and flexible option, it also presents the least amount
    of friction getting started. Since this book is focused on Java, I felt it prudent

    we can take advantage of one of JAX-RS's great features--POJO mapping. We've already
    seen a hint of it in the previous code with `GenericEntity`. JAX-RS will attempt
    to unmarshal--that is, convert from a serialized form to a model object--the JSON
    request body. If the client sends a JSON object in the correct format, we get
    a usable `Note` instance. If the client sends an improperly built object, it gets
    a response. This feature allows us to deal solely with our domain objects and

    be able to move those concerns elsewhere and inject the instances. Hopefully,

    can either be full of CDI configuration elements, or completely empty, which is

    With the braces, though, we're telling JAX-RS that we want to match the additional

- en: When the page loads, the application will immediately send a request to the
    backend for Notes, sending the bearer token, if there is one, in the `Authorization`
    header. When the response returns, we update the state of the `isLoggedIn` property
    in the store, and, if the request was successful, we update the list of `Notes`
    on the page. Note that we're using `fetch()`. That is the new, experimental API
    for sending XHR, or Ajax, requests in browsers. As of the writing of this book,
    it is supported in every major browser except Internet Explorer, so be careful
    using this in production apps if you can't dictate the client's browser.

    in its `state` property. Handled properly, any Vue component bound to one of these
    state fields is automatically updated for you. You don''t need to track and manage
    state, manually reflecting changes on the page as the application state changes.
    Vue and Vuex handle that for you. Mostly. There are some situations, such as array
    mutation (or replacement), that require some special handling. Vuex offers **mutations**
    to help with that. For example, `NotesAction.fetchNotes()`, upon a successful
    request, we will make this call:'

    function or a method with a peculiar invocation syntax if that helps) is a JSON
    array (hopefully, we show no type checking here), so we start by clearing out
    the current list of notes, then iterating over this array, creating and storing
    new objects, and reformatting some of the data as we do so. Strictly using only
    this mutation to replace the set of notes, we can guarantee that the user interface
    is kept in sync with the changing state of the application, all for free.

    of files, all ultimately compiled together using something like Grunt or Gulp,
    and one of these files would be our component''s template. Since we are trying
    to make this as simple as possible by avoiding the JS build processes, we have
    everything declared right on our page. In `index.html`, we can find the template

    to the DOM without it rendering on the page. Inside this template, the interesting
    part is the `div` tag with the `note-list` class. We have the `v-` attribute on
    it, which means the Vue template processor will iterate over the `notes` list
    using this `div` as a template for displaying each `note` in the array.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each note will be rendered using the `span` tag. Using the template markup `:title`,
    we are able to create a value for the title tag using our application state (we
    can't say because string interpolation was deprecated in Vue 2.0). The sole child
    of the `span` tag is the `{{ note.title }}` expression, which renders the title
    of the `note` list as a string. When the user clicks on the note title on the
    page, we want to react to that, so we bind the `onClick` handler to the DOM element
    via `v-on:click`. The function referenced here is the `loadNote()` function that
    we defined in the `methods` block of our component definition.

    JAX-RS endpoints to restrict access to authenticated users, which we authenticate
    against their Google accounts using Google's OAuth2 workflow. We've packaged the
    application using Payara Micro, a great option to develop microservices, and we've
    integrated MongoDB into our application using the MongoDB Java API. Finally, we

    that could be done. The application could use a great deal of styling, and support
    for embedded images and videos would be nice, as would a mobile client. There
    is lots of room for improvements and enhancements with the app, but interested
    parties have a solid foundation to start from. Although, for us, it's time to
    turn to the next chapter and a new project, where we'll jump into the world of
    cloud computing with Functions as a Service.

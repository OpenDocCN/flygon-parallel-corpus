    we're going to build a very practical application, one that lets us send and receive
    SMS messages from the comfort of our desktop. There are a number of products on
    the market that let you do this now, but they typically require a third-party
    service, meaning your message travels through someone else's servers. For the
    privacy-minded, that can be a real problem. We'll build a system that is 100%
    local.

    Starting with Android 6, though, the user is prompted for each permission that
    the application requests, allowing for the possibility of a user to grant some
    permissions while denying others. We will need to request some permissions--we
    need to be able to read and write SMS messages, and we''ll need access to the
    contacts (so we can try to figure out who sent us a given message). Android provides
    an API for requesting those permissions very easily, which we''ll put in our `onCreate()`
    method, as follows:'

    the requested permissions. This is done asynchronously, so, in your applications,
    you need to make sure you don't attempt any operation that requires any permission
    that you request until the user has had a chance to grant the permission (and,
    should the user deny the permission, the application should degrade, or fail,
    gracefully).

    dialog informing the user that both permissions are required, and then exit the
    application.

    to both simultaneously. If you have a complex set of permissions, for example,
    if your application can work with only some of the requested permissions, you
    can make multiple calls to `ActivityCompat.requestPermissions`, providing a distinct
    `requestCode` for each. You would then need to expand your switch block in `onRequestPermissionsResult()`
    to cover each new `requestCode`.

    like these endpoints to be available whenever the phone is on, so we can't use
    an `Activity` to host them. What we want is a `Service`. The Android documentation
    defines a `Service` as *an application component that can perform long-running
    operations in the background, and it does not provide a user interface*. There
    are three types of Services--`scheduled` (which runs on a schedule), `started`
    (which can be started explicitly by another application component), and `bound`
    (which is bound to an application component via the `bindService()` call, and
    runs until all the bound components are destroyed). Since we want this to be available
    all the time, we want a started service.

    is not on Wi-Fi, there's a good chance the intended laptop is not either. There
    may be legitimate use cases for allowing the endpoints to listen even on a cellular
    network, however. Making this restriction configurable is a great candidate for
    a preferences-driven option.

    server to the client. Typically, a REST request is very short-lived--make a connection,
    send the request, get a response, close the connection. Sometimes, though, the
    REST server may not have all of the data that the client wants at the time of
    the request (for example, reading data from another data source such as a log
    file or network socket). So, it would be nice to be able to push that data to
    the client as it becomes available. That's exactly what SSE allows us to do. We'll
    look into that in more detail later.

    For those that might be unaware, `synchronized` is one of the more basic approaches
    to concurrent code available to Java developers. The net effect of this keyword
    is that multiple threads that try to execute this block of code must do so synchronously,
    or one a time. We do this here so that if we have two different processes attempting
    to start the server, we can guarantee that at most one is running. Without this
    block, the first thread could start the server and store the instance in the variable,
    while a second thread could do the same thing, but its server instance, which
    gets stored in the variable, fails to start. We would now have a running server
    with no valid reference to it, so we would be unable to stop it.

    There are a number of resources on the internet that will suggest creating a custom
    `Application` class and storing it in a `public static`. While that does seem
    to work, it will also leak memory, so, Android Studio, for example, will complain
    if you try that. We can, however, avoid that by using nested classes. That approach

    use a `ContentProvider` to access the SMS data. A `ContentProvider` is a way for
    an application, or, in this case, an Android subsystem, to expose data to outside
    consumers in a portable, storage-agnostic manner. We don't care how the data is
    stored. We simply specify what fields we want, what filters or restrictions we
    want placed on that data, and `ContentProvider` does the rest.
  prefs: []

    we would with SQL, but with a `Uri`. In this case, we specify `Telephony.Sms.Conversations.CONTENT_URI`.
    We pass several null values to `query()` as well. These represent the projection
    (or field list), the selection (or filter), the selection arguments, and the sort
    order. Since these are all `null`, we want every field and every row in the natural
    sort order for the provider. That gets us a `Cursor` object, which we then iterate

    the type `Telephony.Sms.MESSAGE_TYPE_SENT`. The values for this field translate
    roughly to folders (sent, received, draft, and so on). Rather than leaking part
    of the Android API into ours by sharing the value of the constant, we have a `boolean`

    need to be careful about how the key is generated. To make sure it's done once
    and only once, we'll use the same type of synchronization/locking we saw in the
    server startup.
  prefs: []

- en: Once we've acquired the lock, we perform a null check to see if the process
    has already generated (or read) the key. If not, we then read the signing key
    from `SharedPreferences`. If it's null, we create a random string (here, just
    a UUID), and save it to `SharedPreferences` for reuse next time. Note that to
    save to Android preferences, we have to get an instance of `SharedPreferences.Editor`,
    write the string, then `commit()`. Once we have the signing key, we create the
    actual `SecretKeySpec` that we'll use to sign and verify our JWTs.

- en: In this chapter, we built a different kind of project. We've had applications
    that run on Android, and some that run on the desktop. This one, though, runs
    on both platforms simultaneously. One is no good without the other. That requires
    that we build things a bit differently to make sure the two are synchronized.
    While there are a variety of ways to go about this, we chose to use a REST server
    on the phone, with the desktop acting as a REST client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of the chapter, we built an Android application that provides not
    only a user interface, but a background process (called `Service`), and embedded
    our REST server in the Android application using Jersey and its Java SE deployment
    option. You also learned how to interact with text (SMS) messages on Android using
    the system-provided Content Providers and platform APIs, and streaming those messages
    to the client using Server-Sent Events. We demonstrated how to send messages between
    processes/threads in Android using `Intent`s, broadcasts, and `BroadcastReceiver`s.
    Finally, on the desktop side, we built a JavaFX client to display and send text
    messages, which connects to the REST server on the phone via the Jersey REST client,
    and we consumed the Server-sent Event stream, updating the user interface as appropriate.

    that might be good to have on your radar.

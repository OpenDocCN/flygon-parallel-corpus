    different types of application, attempting to highlight and demonstrate different
    parts of the Java platform, especially those new to Java 9\. As we've discussed,
    it's impossible to write something with **only** new-in-Java-9 technologies and
    APIs, so we also saw a variety of interesting items from Java 7 and 8\. As Java
    9 is finally shipping, it makes sense to look ahead to see what Java's future
    might hold for us, but it's also wise to look around and see what other languages
    are offering so that we can decide if our next Java will actually **be** Java.
    In this chapter, we'll do just that.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of this effort is to update the Java Virtual Machine, and, if possible,
    the Java language, to support small, immutable, **identity-less** value types.
    Currently, if you instantiate a new `Object`, it is given an identifier by the
    JVM, which allows the **variable** instance to be referenced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you create a new integer, `new Integer(42)`, a variable with
    the identity of `java.lang.Integer@68f29546`, but the value of `42`, the value
    of this variable will never change, and that's all we, as developers, typically
    care about. However, the JVM doesn't really know that, so it has to maintain the
    identity of the variable, with all of the overhead that entails. According to
    Goetz, that means every instance of this object will require up to 24 additional
    bytes to store the instance. If you have a large array of these, for example,
    that can be a significant amount of memory to manage and, eventually, to garbage-collect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What the JVM engineers hope to achieve, then, is a way to **gently extend**
    the Java Virtual Machine byte code and the Java language itself to support the
    notion of a small, immutable aggregate type (think of a class with 0 or more properties)
    that lacks identity, which will result, it is hoped, in "memory-and locality-efficient
    programming idioms without sacrificing encapsulation". Their hope is that Java
    developers will be able to create these new types and treat them as just another
    primitive. If they do their jobs correctly, Goetz says, the feature can be summarized
    as **Codes like a class, works like an int!**

    collections more efficient in terms of memory and computation. You can read more

- en: The term **reified generics** is one that, more often than not, it seems, causes
    very vocal, animated reactions. Currently, if you declare a variable to be of
    type `List<Integer>`, the byte code generated has no real notion of the parameterized
    type, so it's not discoverable at runtime. If you were to examine the variable
    at runtime, you would see no mention of `Integer`. You could, of course, look
    at the types of each element, but, even then, you can't be sure of the type of
    the `List`, as there is nothing enforcing that **only** the `Integer` can be added
    to the `List`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java developers have been clamoring for reified generics, or, put simply, generics
    that retain their type information at runtime since generics were introduced in
    Java 5\. As you might guess, making Java's generics reified is no trivial task,
    but, finally, we have a formal effort to see if it can be done and, if it can
    be done, to find a backwards-compatible way that doesn't have, for example, negative
    performance characteristics.

    The problem with JNI, or at least one of them, is that it requires that every

    the `invokedynamic` bytecode instruction is supposed to have addressed that),
    and many find Groovy's more dynamic nature less appealing. Scala, on the other
    hand, suffers (fairly or not, depending on who you ask) from the perception that
    it's too complex. Compilation time is also a common complaint. Also, many organizations

    interoperability. They aim to allow developers to write less code that does more
    in a clearer fashion via language and library features, and in a language that
    is 100% interoperable with Java. They have added features such as coroutines to
    enable Kotlin-based systems to scale quickly and easily.

    developers, be interested? Let's start with variables.

- en: As you'll recall, Java has both primitive (`int`, `double`, `float`, `char`,
    and so on) and reference, or **wrapper** types (`Integer`, `Double`, `Float`,
    `String`, and so on). As we've discussed in this chapter, the JVM engineers are
    working on ways to ameliorate some of the behavioral and capability differences
    this dichotomy brings. Kotlin avoids this altogether, as every value is an object,
    so there's no concern over `List<int>` versus `List<Integer>`.

    to future Java language changes, these keywords allow us to declare mutable and
    immutable variables (respectively). Also notice that we need not declare the type
    of the variable, as the compiler handles that for us. In certain situations, we
    may need to explicitly declare the type, for example, in situations where the
    compiler might guess incorrectly or when it just does not have enough information
    to make a guess, at which point, it will stop compiling and present an error message.
    In those situations, we can declare the type this way:'

    Kotlin has null support as well, but it''s built into the language. By default,
    all variables in Kotlin are **not** nullable. That is to say, if the compiler
    can tell that you are attempting to assign a null value to a variable, or if it
    can''t determine whether or not a value might be null (for example, a return value
    from a Java API), you''ll get a compiler error. To indicate that a value is null-capable,
    you add a `?` to the variable declaration as follows:'

    shortcut for if-not-null checks. For example, consider the following lines of

    demonstrate, though, is the ability to safely use a nullable variable in an arbitrarily
    large, complex block of code. It's also worth noting that, inside the `let` block,
    the compiler knows that `city` is not null so no further null checks are necessary.

    which, it seems, no modern language is worth considering. Kotlin does, indeed,
    have full support for lambdas, higher order functions, underscores as lambda parameter
    names, and so on. Its support and syntax are very similar to Java's, so Java developers
    should be very comfortable with Kotlin's lambdas.

    definitely thinks so, as they have it in use in many of their applications, both
    internal and external. Other notable users include Pinterest, Gradle, Evernote,
    Uber, Pivotal, Atlassian, and Basecamp. Kotlin is even officially supported by
    Google (in Android Studio) for Android development, so it's definitely a production-grade
    language.

- en: There is much more that can be discussed of course, about Java 10 and these
    two languages, and the myriad of other projects happening in and around the Java
    Virtual Machine. After over 20 years of development, Java--the language **and**
    the environment--is still going strong. In the pages of this book, I've tried
    to demonstrate some of these great advancements in the language, giving you a
    variety of starting points for your own projects, sample code to study and reuse,
    and explanations of various libraries, APIs, and technologies that may be helpful
    in your day-to-day work. I hope you've enjoyed the examples and explanations as
    much as I've enjoyed preparing them, and, more importantly, I hope they help you
    build the Next Big Thing.

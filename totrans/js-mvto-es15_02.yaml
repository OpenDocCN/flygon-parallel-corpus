- en: It is always difficult to pen the first few words, especially on a subject like
    JavaScript. This difficulty arises primarily because so many things have been
    said about this language. JavaScript has been the *Language of the Web*—lingua
    franca, if you will, since the earliest days of the Netscape Navigator. JavaScript
    went from a tool of the amateur to the weapon of the connoisseur in a shockingly
    short period of time.

- en: JavaScript is the most popular language on the web and open source ecosystem.
    [http://githut.info/](http://githut.info/) charts the number of active repositories
    and overall popularity of the language on GitHub for the last few years. JavaScript's
    popularity and importance can be attributed to its association with the browser.
    Google's V8 and Mozilla's SpiderMonkey are extremely optimized JavaScript engines
    that power Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers, respectively.

- en: Although web browsers are the most widely used platforms for JavaScript, modern
    databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB use JavaScript as their scripting and query
    language. JavaScript has become an important platform outside browsers as well.
    Projects such as **Node.js** and **io.js** provide powerful platforms to develop
    scalable server environments using JavaScript. Several interesting projects are
    pushing the language capabilities to its limits, for example, **Emscripten** ([http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/))
    is a **Low-Level Virtual Machine** (**LLVM**)-based project that compiles C and
    C++ into highly optimizable JavaScript in an **asm.js** format. This allows you
    to run C and C++ on the web at near native speed.

    dynamic objects, loose typing, prototypal inheritance, and a powerful object literal
    notation.

- en: While JavaScript is built on sound design principles, unfortunately, the language
    had to evolve along with the browser. Web browsers are notorious in the way they
    support various features and standards. JavaScript tried to accommodate all the
    whims of the browsers and ended up making some very bad design decisions. These
    bad parts (the term made famous by Douglas Crockford) overshadowed the good parts
    of the language for most people. Programmers wrote bad code, other programmers
    had nightmares trying to debug that bad code, and the language eventually got
    a bad reputation. Unfortunately, JavaScript is one of the most misunderstood programming
    languages ([http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another criticism leveled at JavaScript is that it lets you get things done
    without you being an expert in the language. I have seen programmers write exceptionally
    bad JavaScript code just because they wanted to get the things done quickly and
    JavaScript allowed them to do just this. I have spent hours debugging very bad
    quality JavaScript written by someone who clearly was not a programmer. However,
    the language is a tool and cannot be blamed for sloppy programming. Like all crafts,
    programming demands extreme dedication and discipline.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1993, the **Mosaic** browser of **National Center for Supercomputing Applications**
    (**NCSA**) was one of the first popular web browsers. A year later, Netscape Communications
    created the proprietary web browser, **Netscape Navigator**. Several original
    Mosaic authors worked on Navigator.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1995, Netscape Communications hired Brendan Eich with the promise of letting
    him implement **Scheme** (a Lisp dialect) in the browser. Before this happened,
    Netscape got in touch with Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) to include Java in the
    Navigator browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the popularity and easy programming of Java, Netscape decided that a
    scripting language had to have a syntax similar to that of Java. This ruled out
    adopting existing languages such as Python, **Tool Command Language** (**TCL**),
    or Scheme. Eich wrote the initial prototype in just 10 days ([http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007.pdf](http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/co/2012/02/mco2012020007.pdf)),
    in May 1995\. JavaScript's first code name was **Mocha**, coined by Marc Andreessen.
    Netscape later changed it to **LiveScript**, for trademark reasons. In early December
    1995, Sun licensed the trademark Java to Netscape. The language was renamed to
    its final name, JavaScript.

    This module is going to focus on the correct ways to code in JavaScript. We are
    going to spend a lot of time understanding how to avoid the bad parts of the language
    and build reliable and readable code in JavaScript. We will skirt away from sloppy
    features of the language just to make sure that you are not getting used to them—if
    you have already learned to code using these habits, this module will try to nudge
    you away from this. There will be a lot of focus on the correct style and tools
    to make your code better.

- en: A few special values are also defined as part of the Number type. The first
    two are `Number.MAX_VALUE` and `Number.MIN_VALUE`, which define the outer bounds
    of the Number value set. All ECMAScript numbers must fall between these two values,
    without exception. A calculation can, however, result in a number that does not
    fall in between these two numbers. When a calculation results in a number greater
    than `Number.MAX_VALUE`, it is assigned a value of `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`,
    meaning that it has no numeric value anymore. Likewise, a calculation that results
    in a number less than `Number.MIN_VALUE` is assigned a value of `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`,
    which also has no numeric value. If a calculation returns an infinite value, the
    result cannot be used in any further calculations. You can use the `isInfinite()`
    method to verify if the calculation result is an infinity.

- en: In this chapter, we set some foundations around JavaScript grammar, types, and
    stylistic considerations. We have consciously not talked about other important
    aspects such as functions, variable scopes, and closures primarily because they
    deserve their own place in this module. I am sure that this chapter helps you
    understand some of the primary concepts of JavaScript. With these foundations
    in place, we will take a look at how we can write professional quality JavaScript
    code.

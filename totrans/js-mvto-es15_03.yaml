    JavaScript. These are some of the features of the language that give JavaScript
    its power and elegance. If you are an intermediate- or advanced-level JavaScript
    programmer, you may be actively using objects and functions. In many cases, however,
    developers stumble at these fundamental levels and develop a half-baked or sometimes
    wrong understanding of the core JavaScript constructs. There is generally a very
    poor understanding of the concept of closures in JavaScript, due to which many
    programmers cannot use the functional aspects of JavaScript very well. In JavaScript,
    there is a strong interconnection between objects, functions, and closures. Understanding
    the strong relationship between these three concepts can vastly improve our JavaScript
    programming ability, giving us a strong foundation for any type of application
    development.

    is the single most important weapon in your arsenal. The most important fact about
    functions is that in JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. They are treated
    like any other JavaScript object. Just like other JavaScript data types, they
    can be referenced by variables, declared with literals, and even passed as function
    parameters.

    The function name is optional. If a function is not given a name, it is said to
    be anonymous. We will see how anonymous functions are used. The third part is
    the set of parameters of the function, wrapped in parentheses. Within the parentheses
    is a set of zero or more parameter names separated by commas. These names will
    be defined as variables in the function, and instead of being initialized to undefined,
    they will be initialized to the arguments supplied when the function is invoked.
    The fourth part is a set of statements wrapped in curly braces. These statements
    are the body of the function. They are executed when the function is invoked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    When you declare functions like this, the content of the function is compiled
    and an object with the same name as the function is created.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For beginners, JavaScript scoping is slightly confusing. These concepts may
    seem straightforward; however, they are not. Some important subtleties exist that
    must be understood in order to master the concept. So what is Scope? In JavaScript,
    scope refers to the current context of code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A variable's scope is the context in which the variable exists. The scope specifies
    from where you can access a variable and whether you have access to the variable
    in that context. Scopes can be globally or locally defined.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global scope
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any variable that you declare is by default defined in global scope. This is
    one of the most annoying language design decisions taken in JavaScript. As a global
    variable is visible in all other scopes, a global variable can be modified by
    any scope. Global variables make it harder to run loosely coupled subprograms
    in the same program/module. If the subprograms happen to have global variables
    that share the same names, then they will interfere with each other and likely
    fail, usually in difficult-to-diagnose ways. This is sometimes known as namespace
    clash. We discussed global scope in the previous chapter but let's revisit it
    briefly to understand how best to avoid this.
  prefs: []

- en: JavaScript uses scope chains to establish the scope for a given function. There
    is typically one global scope, and each function defined has its own nested scope.
    Any function defined within another function has a local scope that is linked
    to the outer function. *It's always the position in the source that defines the
    scope*. When resolving a variable, JavaScript starts at the innermost scope and
    searches outwards. With this, let's look at various scoping rules in JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the preceding crudely drawn visual, you can see that the `foo()` function
    is defined in the global scope. The `foo()` function has its local scope and access
    to the `g` variable because it's in the global scope. The `a`, `b`, and `c` variables
    are available in the local scope because they are defined within the function
    scope. The `bar()` function is also declared within the function scope and is
    available within the `foo()` function. However, once the function scope is over,
    the `bar()` function is not available. You cannot see or call the `bar()` function
    from outside the `foo()` function—a scope bubble.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now that the `bar()` function also has its own function scope (bubble), what
    is available in here? The `bar()` function has access to the `foo()` function
    and all the variables created in the parent scope of the `foo()` function—`a`,
    `b`, and `c`. The `bar()` function also has access to the global scoped variable,
    `g`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a powerful idea. Take a moment to think about it. We just discussed
    how rampant and uncontrolled global scope can get in JavaScript. How about we
    take an arbitrary piece of code and wrap it around with a function? We will be
    able to hide and create a scope bubble around this piece of code. Creating the
    correct scope using function wrapping will help us create correct code and prevent
    difficult-to-detect bugs.

    Functions that are designed to be called with the `new` prefix are called constructors.
    Usually, they are named using **PascalCase** as opposed to **CamelCase** for easier
    distinction. In the following example, notice that the `greet` function uses this

- en: Traditionally, closures have been a feature of purely functional programming
    languages. JavaScript shows its affinity with such functional programming languages
    by considering closures integral to the core language constructs. Closures are
    gaining popularity in mainstream JavaScript libraries and advanced production
    code because they let you simplify complex operations. You will hear experienced
    JavaScript programmers talking almost reverently about closures—as if they are
    some magical construct far beyond the reach of the intellect that common men possess.
    However, this is not so. When you study this concept, you will find closures to
    be very obvious, almost matter-of-fact. Till you reach closure enlightenment,
    I suggest you read and reread this chapter, research on the Internet, write code,
    and read JavaScript libraries to understand how closures behave—but do not give
    up.

    in JavaScript. We discussed in great detail how lexical scope is determined at

    how all identifiers are declared and predicts how they will be looked up during
    execution.

- en: In a nutshell, closure is the scope created when a function is declared that
    allows the function to access and manipulate variables that are external to this
    function. In other words, closures allow a function to access all the variables,
    as well as other functions, that are in scope when the function itself is declared.

    of a closure. We are declaring a variable in the global scope and declaring a
    function in the global scope. In the function, we are able to access the variable
    declared in the global scope—`outer`. So essentially, the outer scope for the
    `outerFn()` function is a closure and always available to `outerFn()`. This is
    a good start but perhaps then you are not sure why this is such a great thing.

    the inner function, long after the scope in which it was created has gone away?
    When we declared `innerFn()` in `outerFn()`, not only was the function declaration
    defined, but a closure was also created that encompasses not only the function
    declaration, but also all the variables that are in scope at the point of the
    declaration. When `innerFn()` executes, even if it's executed after the scope
    in which it was declared goes away, it has access to the original scope in which
    it was declared through its closure.

    closure. There are two important points that we want to highlight.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the function is declared. This makes it possible for the line, `console.log(magic)`,
    in `innerFn()`, to work.

- en: '[PRE46]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the preceding example, we are creating a function that we intend to call
    as a constructor. In this `privateTest()` function, we are creating a `var points=0`
    variable as a function-scoped variable. This variable is available only in `privateTest()`.
    Additionally, we create an accessor function (also called a getter)—`getPoints()`—this
    method allows us to read the value of only the points variable from outside `privateTest()`,
    making this variable private to the function. However, another method, `score()`,
    allows us to modify the value of the private point variable without directly accessing
    it from outside. This makes it possible for us to write code where a private variable
    is updated in a controlled fashion. This pattern can be very useful when you are
    writing libraries where you want to control how variables are accessed based on
    a contract and pre-established interface.

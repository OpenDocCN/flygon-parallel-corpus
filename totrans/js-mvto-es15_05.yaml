    constructs that are immutable but have methods. In this chapter, you will learn

- en: Before we start looking at how JavaScript treats objects, we should spend some
    time on an object-oriented paradigm. Like most programming paradigms, **object-oriented
    programming** (**OOP**) also emerged from the need to manage complexity. The main
    idea is to divide the entire system into smaller pieces that are isolated from
    each other. If these small pieces can hide as many implementation details as possible,
    they become easy to use. A classic car analogy will help you understand this very
    important point about OOP.
  prefs: []

- en: When you drive a car, you operate on the interface—the steering, clutch, brake,
    and accelerator. Your view of using the car is limited by this interface, which
    makes it possible for us to drive the car. This interface is essentially hiding
    all the complex systems that really drive the car, such as the internal functioning
    of its engine, its electronic system, and so on. As a driver, you don't bother
    about these complexities. A similar idea is the primary driver of OOP. An object
    hides the complexities of how to implement a particular functionality and exposes
    a limited interface to the outside world. All other systems can use this interface
    without really bothering about the internal complexity that is hidden from view.
    Additionally, an object usually hides its internal state from other objects and
    prevents its direct modification. This is an important aspect of OOP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a large system where a lot of objects call other objects' interfaces, things
    can go really bad if you allow them to modify the internal state of such objects.
    OOP operates on the idea that the state of an object is inherently hidden from
    the outside world and it can be changed only via controlled interface operations.

    structured programming. However, many feel that OOP is overdone. Most OOP systems
    define complex and unnecessary class and type hierarchies. Another big drawback
    was that in the pursuit of hiding the state, OOP considered the object state almost
    immaterial. Though hugely popular, OOP was clearly flawed in many areas. Still,
    OOP did have some very good ideas, especially hiding the complexity and exposing
    only the interface to the outside world. JavaScript picked up a few good ideas
    and built its object model around them. Luckily, this makes JavaScript objects
    very versatile. In their seminal work, *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable
    Object-Oriented Software*, the *Gang of Four* gave two fundamental principles

    to be an object that is linked via its prototype to `Parent.prototype`. If the
    parent constructor contains additional logic specific to the parent, we don't
    want to run this while creating the child object. This can cause very difficult-to-find

    constructor function sets the value of the `projects` property and implicitly
    sets the value of the internal `__proto__` property to the value of `TeamLead.prototype`.
    The `__proto__` property determines the prototype chain used to return property
    values. This process does not set values for properties inherited from the prototype
    chain in the `jason` object. When the value of a property is read, JavaScript
    first checks to see whether the value exists in that object. If the value does
    exist, this value is returned. If the value is not there, JavaScript checks the
    prototype chain using the `__proto__` property. Having said this, what happens
    when you do the following:'

    you create an instance of the `Employee` object, this instance gets a local value
    for the name. When you set the `TeamLead` prototype by creating a new `Employee`
    object, `TeamLead.prototype` has a local value for the `name` property. Therefore,
    when JavaScript looks up the `name` property of the `jason` object, which is an
    instance of `TeamLead`), it finds the local value for this property in `TeamLead.prototype`.
    It does not try to do further lookups up the chain to `Employee.prototype`.

    as the name suggests, **setters** are methods that set the value of a property.
    Often, you may want to derive a value based on some other values. Traditionally,
    getters and setters used to be functions such as the following:'

    used to do *get* and *set* of properties. `Fullname` is a derived property by

    use case and ECMAScript 5 now provides you with a default syntax for getters and

- en: JavaScript applications can improve in clarity and quality by allowing for the
    greater degree of control and structure that object-orientation can bring to the
    code. JavaScript object-orientation is based on the function prototypes and prototypal
    inheritance. These two ideas can provide an incredible amount of wealth to developers.

    how constructor functions are used to create objects. We dived into prototype
    chains and how inheritance operates on the idea of prototype chains. These foundations
    will be used to build your knowledge of JavaScript patterns that we will explore
    in the next chapter.

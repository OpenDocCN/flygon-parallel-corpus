    write code in JavaScript. Once you start building larger systems using these fundamental
    constructs, you soon realize that there can be a standard way of doing a few things.
    While developing a large system, you will encounter repetitive problems; a pattern
    intends to provide a standardized solution to such known and identified problems.
    A pattern can be seen as a best practice, useful abstraction, or template to solve
    common problems. Writing maintainable code is difficult. The key to write modular,
    correct, and maintainable code is the ability to understand the repeating themes
    and use common templates to write optimized solutions to these. The most important
    text on design patterns was a book published in 1995 called *Design Patterns:
    Elements Of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* written by *Erich Gamma, Richard
    Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides*—a group that became known as the **Gang**
    **of Four** (**GOF** for short). This seminal work gave a formal definition to
    various patterns and explained implementation details of most of the popular patterns
    that we use today. It is important to understand why patterns are important:'

    and how to avoid pitfalls. In the usual software development cycle, there are
    several places where bad code is introduced, mainly around the time where the
    code is nearing a release or when the code is handed over to a different team
    for maintenance. If such bad design constructs are documented as anti-patterns,
    they can provide guidance to developers in knowing what pitfalls to avoid and
    how not to subscribe to bad design patterns. Most languages have their set of

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Excessive use of the global scope is almost a taboo in JavaScript. When you
    build larger programs, it is sometimes difficult to control how much the global
    scope is polluted. Namespace can reduce the number of globals created by the program
    and also helps in avoiding naming collisions or excessive name prefixing. The
    idea of using namespaces is creating a global object for your application or library
    and adding all these objects and functions to that object rather than polluting
    the global scope with objects. JavaScript doesn''t have an explicit syntax for
    namespaces, but namespaces can be easily created. Let''s consider the following
    example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'We are creating all this in the global scope. This is an anti-pattern, and
    this is never a good idea. We can, however, refactor this code and create a single
    global object and make all the functions and objects part of this global object
    as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: By convention, the global namespace object name is generally written in all
    caps. This pattern adds namespace to the application and prevents naming collisions
    in your code and between your code and external library that you use. Many projects
    use a distinct name after their company or project to create a unique name for
    their namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though this seems like an ideal way to restrict your globals and add a namespace
    to your code, it is a bit verbose; you need to prefix every variable and function
    with the namespace. You need to type more and the code becomes unnecessarily verbose.
    Additionally, a single global instance would mean that any part of the code can
    modify the global instance and the rest of the functionality gets the updated
    state—this can cause very nasty side-effects. A curious thing to observe in the
    earlier example is this line—`var CARFACTORY = CARFACTORY || {};`. When you are
    working on a large code base, you can't assume that you are creating this namespace
    (or assigning a property to it) for the first time. It is possible that the namespace
    may pre-exist. To make sure that you create the namespace only if it is not already
    created, it is safe to always rely on the quick defaulting via a short-circuit
    `||` operator.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    difficult to keep the code base organized and modular. The module patterns help
    in keeping the code cleanly separated and organized.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Module separates bigger programs into smaller pieces and gives them a namespace.
    This is very important because once you separate code into modules, these modules
    can be reused in several places. Carefully designing interfaces for the modules
    will make your code very easy to reuse and extend.
  prefs: []

    robust module systems. Function scopes help create namespaces that are internal
    for the module, and objects can be used to store sets of exported values.

    concepts that we discussed earlier.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In JavaScript, the module pattern is used very heavily. Modules help in mimicking
    the concept of classes. Modules allow us to include both public/private methods
    and variables of an object, but most importantly, modules restrict these parts
    from the global scope. As the variables and functions are contained in the module
    scope, we automatically prevent naming conflict with other scripts using the same
    names.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another beautiful aspect of the module pattern is that we expose only a public
    API. Everything else related to the internal implementation is held private within
    the module's closure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike other OO languages, JavaScript has no explicit access modifiers and,
    hence, there is no concept of *privacy*. You can't have public or private variables.
    As we discussed earlier, in JavaScript, the function scope can be used to enforce
    this concept. The module pattern uses closures to restrict variable and function
    access only within the module; however, variables and functions are defined in
    the object being returned, which is available to the public.
  prefs: []

    To make sure that we are not polluting the global context with modules, it is
    important to create namespaces for the modules. Moreover, as modules are inherently

    module pattern. This improved variation of the module pattern is also known as
    the **revealing** **module pattern** (**RMP**). RMP was first popularized by *Christian
    Heilmann*. He disliked that it was necessary to use the module name while calling
    a public function from another function or accessing a public variable. Another
    small problem is that you have to use an object literal notation while returning
    the public interface. Consider the following example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: You can see that we need to call `publicFnTwo()` via `modulePattern` in `publicFn()`.
    Additionally, the public interface is returned in an object literal. The improvement
    on the classic module pattern is what is known as the RMP. The primary idea behind
    this pattern is to define all of the members in the private scope and return an
    anonymous object with pointers to the private functionality that needs to be revealed
    as public.
  prefs: []

    to create modules. Currently, there are two main approaches to create modules.
    The first is known as **CommonJS modules**. CommonJS modules are usually more
    suited for server-side JavaScript environments such as **Node.js**. A CommonJS
    module contains a `require()` function that receives the name of the module and
    returns the module''s interface. The format was proposed by the volunteer group
    of CommonJS; their aim was to design, prototype, and standardize JavaScript APIs.
    CommonJS modules consist of two parts. Firstly, list of variables and functions
    the module needs to expose; when you assign a variable or function to the `module.exports`

    can observe in this example, we are creating a shared `CustomLogger` object that
    is intended to be used by any object instance needing its functionality. One such
    object is `CustomServer`—in its `init()` method, we call this custom logger's
    `log()` method. This method is available to `CustomServer` because we are extending
    `CustomLogger` via Underscore's `extend()`. We are dynamically adding functionality
    of a mixin to the consumer object. It is important to understand the distinction
    between mixins and inheritance. When you have shared functionality across multiple
    objects and class hierarchies, you can use mixins. If you have shared functionality
    along a single class hierarchy, you can use inheritance. In prototypical inheritance,
    when you inherit from a prototype, any change to the prototype affects everything
    that inherits the prototype. If you do not want this to happen, you can use mixins.

    want your model to be persisted to an in-memory store or database.

    model is processed, filtered, or massaged before it is presented to the view layer.
    In JavaScript, views are responsible for rendering and manipulating DOM elements.
    Views observe models and get notified when there is a change in the model. When
    the user interacts with the view, certain attributes of the model are changed
    via the view layer (usually via controllers). In JavaScript frameworks such as
    Backbone, the views are created using template engines such as **Handlebar.js**
    ([http://handlebarsjs.com/](http://handlebarsjs.com/)) or **mustache.js** ([https://mustache.github.io/](https://mustache.github.io/)).
    These templates themselves are not views. They observe models and keep the view
    state updated based on these changes. Let''s see an example of a view defined
    in Handlebar:'

    variables. These variables are delimited via a custom syntax. For example, template
    variables are delimited using `{{ }}` in Handlebar.js. Frameworks typically transmit
    data in JSON format. How the view is populated from the model is handled transparently
    by the framework.

    updating the model when the user changes the view attributes. Most JavaScript
    frameworks deviate from the classical definition of a controller. For example,
    Backbone does not have a concept called controller; they have something called
    a **router** that is responsible to handle routing logic. You can think of a combination
    of the view and router as a controller because a lot of the logic to synchronize
    models and views is done within the view itself. A typical Backbone router would
    look as follows:'

- en: 'Model-View-Presenter is a variation of the original MVC pattern that we discussed
    previously. Both MVC and MVP target the separation of concerns but they are different
    on many fundamental aspects. The presenter in MVP has the necessary logic for
    the view. Any invocation from the view gets delegated to the presenter. The presenter
    also observes the model and updates the views when the model updates. Many authors
    take the view that because the presenter binds the model with views, it also performs
    the role of a traditional controller. There are various implementations of MVP
    and there are no frameworks that offer classical MVP out of the box. In implementations
    of MVP, the following are the primary differences that separate MVP from MVC:'

    Foundation** (**WPF**) and **Silverlight**. MVVM is a variation of MVC and MVP
    and further tries to separate the user interface (view) from the business model
    and application behavior. MVVM creates a new model layer in addition to the domain
    model that we discussed in MVC and MVP. This model layer adds properties as an
    interface for the view. Let''s say that we have a checkbox on the UI. The state
    of the checkbox is captured in an `IsChecked` property. In MVP, the view will
    have this property and the presenter will set it. However, in MVVM, the presenter
    will have the `IsChecked` property and the view is responsible for syncing with
    it. Now that the presenter is not really doing the job of a classical presenter,
    it''s renamed as ViewModel:'

- en: While building large applications, we see certain problem patterns repeating
    over and over. These patterns have well-defined solutions that can be reused to
    build a robust solution. In this chapter, we discussed some of the important patterns
    and ideas around these patterns. Most modern JavaScript applications use these
    patterns. It is rare to see a large-scale system built without implementing modules,
    decorators, factories, or MV* patterns. These are foundational ideas that we discussed
    in this chapter. We will discuss various testing and debugging techniques in the
    next chapter.

    of the browser. It speaks volumes about the brilliance of the language given that
    JavaScript has gained significant popularity as a language to program scalable
    server systems. In this chapter, we will look at Node.js. Node.js is one of the
    most popular JavaScript frameworks used for server-side programming. Node.js is
    also one of the most watched project on GitHub and has superb community support.

    the overall program execution if the program keeps waiting on these I/O operations

- en: When you call `fileSystemReader.read()`, you are reading a file from the filesystem.
    As we just saw, I/O is the bottleneck here and can take quite a while before the
    read operation is completed. Depending on the kind of hardware, filesystem, OS,
    and so on, this operation will block the overall program execution quite a bit.
    The preceding code does some I/O that will be a blocking operation—the process
    will be blocked till I/O finishes and the data comes back. This is the traditional
    I/O model and most of us are familiar with this. However, this is costly and can
    cause terribly latency. Every process has associated memory and state—both these
    will be blocked till I/O is complete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a program blocks I/O, the Node server will refuse new requests. There are
    several ways of solving this problem. The most popular traditional approach is
    to use several threads to process requests—this technique is known as multithreading.
    If are you familiar with languages such as Java, chances are that you have written
    multithreaded code. Several languages support threads in various forms—a thread
    essentially holds its own memory and state. Writing multithreaded applications
    on a large scale is tough. When multiple threads are accessing a common shared
    memory or values, maintaining the correct state across these threads is a very
    difficult task. Threads are also costly when it comes to memory and CPU utilization.
    Threads that are used on synchronized resources may eventually get blocked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The browser handles this differently. I/O in the browser happens outside the
    main execution thread and an event is emitted when I/O finishes. This event is
    handled by the callback function associated with that event. This type of I/O
    is non-blocking and asynchronous. As I/O is not blocking the main execution thread,
    the browser can continue to process other events as they come without waiting
    on any I/O. This is a powerful idea. Asynchronous I/O allows browsers to respond
    to several events and allows a high level of interactivity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node uses a similar idea for asynchronous processing. Node's event loop runs
    as a single thread. This means that the application that you write is essentially
    single-threaded. This does not mean that Node itself is single-threaded. Node
    uses **libuv** and is multithreaded—fortunately, these details are hidden within
    Node and you don't need to know them while developing your application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every call that involves an I/O call requires you to register a callback. Registering
    a callback is also asynchronous and returns immediately. As soon as an I/O operation
    is completed, its callback is pushed on the event loop. It is executed as soon
    as all the other callbacks that were pushed on the event loop before are executed.
    All operations are essentially thread-safe, primarily because there is no parallel
    execution path in the event loop that will require synchronization.
  prefs: []

    carefully how callbacks work; you may feel like you're learning programming for
    the first time. As everything is asynchronous in Node, you will be using callbacks
    for everything without trying to carefully structure them. The most important
    part of the Node.js project is sometimes the code organization and module management.
  prefs: []

- en: When you execute this code, you will see that the value of the `status` variable
    is still `undefined`. In this example, we are making an HTTP call—this is an I/O
    operation. When we do an I/O operation, the execution becomes asynchronous. In
    the earlier example, we are doing everything within the memory and there was no
    I/O involved, hence, the execution was synchronous. When we run this program,
    all of the functions are immediately defined, but they don't all execute immediately.
    The `request()` function is called and the execution continues to the next line.
    If there is nothing to execute, Node will either wait for I/O to finish or it
    will exit. When the `request()` function finishes its work, it will execute the
    callback function (an anonymous function as the second parameter to the `request()`
    function). The reason that we got `undefined` in the preceding example is that
    nowhere in our code exists the logic that tells the `console.log()` statement
    to wait until the `request()` function has finished fetching the response from
    the HTTP call.

    to understand while learning how to program with callbacks is that functions are
    first-class objects that can be stored in variables and passed around with different
    names. Giving simple and descriptive names to your variables is important in making
    your code readable by others. Now that the callback function is called once the

    task. As the language matures, several of the inherent problems are being taken
    care of. There are several exceptional libraries that aid in writing good quality
    code. For most serious systems, *good code = correct code + high performance code*.
    The demands of new-generation software systems are high on performance. In this

    DevTools in Chrome, and in the **Profiles** tab, click on the **Start** button
    or press *Cmd*/*Ctrl* + *E*. Refresh the **V8 Benchmark Suite** page. When the
    page has completed reloading, a score for the benchmark tests is shown. Return

    server applications in JavaScript. We dived deep into some core concepts on Node,

    functional behavior of JavaScript. These concepts are so essential that most of
    the JavaScript patterns are based on them. We looked at how we can utilize these
    patterns to write better code with JavaScript. We studied how JavaScript can operate
    on a DOM and how to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM effectively. Finally, we
    looked at the server-side avatar of JavaScript in Node.js.

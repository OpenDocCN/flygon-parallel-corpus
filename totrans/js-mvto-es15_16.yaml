    reasons that cannot be done. Perhaps the implementation exists inside third party

- en: The adapter itself can grow to be quite complex to adjust one interface to another.
    In order to avoid creating very complex adapters, care must be taken. It is certainly
    not inconceivable to build several adapters, one atop another. If you find an
    adapter becoming too large then it is a good idea to stop and examine if the adapter
    is following the single responsibility principle. That is to say, ensure that
    each class has only one thing for which it has some responsibility. A class that
    looks up users from a database should not also contain functionality for sending
    e-mails to these users. That is too much responsibility. Complex adapters can
    be replaced with a composite object, which will be explored later in this chapter.

  zh: 适配器本身可能会变得非常复杂，以调整一个接口到另一个接口。为了避免创建非常复杂的适配器，必须小心谨慎。构建多个适配器是完全可以想象的，一个叠加在另一个之上。如果发现一个适配器变得太大，那么停下来检查一下适配器是否遵循单一职责原则是个好主意。也就是说，确保每个类只负责一件事。一个从数据库中查找用户的类不应该包含发送电子邮件给这些用户的功能。这责任太大了。复杂的适配器可以用复合对象来替换，这将在本章后面探讨。
- en: From the testing perspective, adapters can be used to totally wrap third party

- en: The adapter is a very powerful pattern for simplifying code interfaces. Massaging
    interfaces to better match a requirement is useful in countless places. The pattern
    is certainly useful in JavaScript. Applications written in JavaScript tend to
    make use of a large number of small libraries. By wrapping up these libraries
    in adapters I'm able to limit the number of places I interact with the libraries
    directly; this means that the libraries can easily be replaced.

  zh: 适配器是简化代码接口的非常强大的模式。调整接口以更好地匹配需求在无数地方都是有用的。这种模式在JavaScript中肯定是有用的。用JavaScript编写的应用程序往往会使用大量的小型库。通过用适配器封装这些库，我能够限制我直接与库交互的地方的数量；这意味着可以轻松替换这些库。

    are written to provide a consistent interface. The adapters implement a consistent
    interface and provide fills so that each API can be called consistently. To expand
    on the shape sorter metaphor a bit more, we can imagine that we have a variety

    decorator pattern is an alternative to subclassing an existing component. Subclassing
    is typically a compile time operation and is a tight coupling. This means that
    once subclassing is performed, there is no way to alter it at runtime. In cases
    where there are many possible subclassings that can act in combination, the number
    of combinations of subclassings explodes. Let's look at an example.

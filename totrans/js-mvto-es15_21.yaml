    to solve local problems, that is; problems that span only a handful of classes
    and not the whole application. These patterns have been narrow in scope. They
    frequently only relate to two or three classes and might be used but a single
    time in any given application. As you can imagine there are also larger scale
    patterns that are applicable to the application as a whole. You might think of
    "toolbar" as a general pattern that is used in many places in an application.
    What's more, it is a pattern that is used in a great number of applications to
    give them a similar look and feel. Patterns can help guide how the whole application
    is assembled.

    to calling the MV* family. This family includes MVC, MVVM, MVP, and even PAC.
    Just like their names, the patterns themselves are pretty similar. The chapter
    will cover each of these patterns and show how, or if, we can apply them to JavaScript.
    We'll also pay special attention to how the patterns differ from one another.

    Smalltalk. It was the language which made classes famous. Like many of these patterns,
    the original MV* pattern, **Model View Controller** (**MVC**), was used long before
    it was ever identified. Although difficult to prove it seems that MVC was originally
    suggested in the late 1970s by Trygve Reenskaug, a Norwegian computer scientist,
    during a visit to the legendary Xerox PARC. Through the 1980s the pattern became
    heavily used in Smalltalk applications. However, it was not until 1988 that the
    pattern was more formally documented in an article entitled, *A Cookbook for Using
    the Model-View-Controller User Interface Paradigm* by Glenn E. Krasner and Stephen
    T. Pope.

    This is typically done through the use of an observer pattern. The model does
    not typically know about either the controller or the view. The first is simply
    the thing telling it to change and the second is only updated through the observer
    pattern so the model doesn't have direct knowledge of it.

    cases, especially those related to JavaScript, the view will be a graphical object.

- en: Next, the controller implements a `validate` method. This method checks to make
    sure that the model is valid. Some validation may be performed on the client,
    such as testing the format of a postal code, but other validation requires a server
    trip. If a username must be unique then there is no reasonable way to test that
    on the client without communicating with the server. In some cases, the validation
    functionality may exist on the model rather than in the controller.

- en: Methods for setting up various different views are also found in the controller.
    In this case we have a bit of a workflow with a view for creating a castle then
    views for both success and failure. The failure case just returns the same view

    model. This is because the view in MVP doesn't have any idea about what model
    is being used. That information is abstracted away by the presenter. The reference
    to presenter remains in the constructor to allow sending messages back to the
    presenter.

  zh: 正如你所看到的，视图的构造函数不再接受对模型的引用。这是因为MVP中的视图对使用的模型一无所知。这些信息被呈现者抽象掉了。对呈现者的引用仍然保留在构造函数中，以便向呈现者发送消息。
- en: Without the model there is an increase in the number of public setter and getter
    methods. These setters allow the presenter to make updates to the state of the
    view. The getters provide an abstraction over how the view stores the state and
    gives the presenter a way to get the information. The `saveCastle` function no
    longer passes any values to the presenter.

    The `saveCastle` method calls into the view to get its values. However, the presenter
    does make sure to use the public methods of the view instead of referencing the
    document directly. The `saveCastle` method updates the model. If there are validation
    errors, then it will call back into the view to update the `IsValid` flag. This
    is an example of the double dispatch I mentioned earlier.
  id: totrans-85
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你可以看到，视图现在以持久的方式在呈现者中被引用。`saveCastle`方法调用视图获取其值。然而，呈现者确保使用视图的公共方法而不是直接引用文档。`saveCastle`方法更新模型。如果存在验证错误，它将回调到视图更新`IsValid`标志。这是我之前提到的双重分派的一个例子。
- en: Finally, the model remains unchanged from before. We've kept the validation
    logic in the presenter. At which level the validation is done, model or presenter,
    matters less than being consistent in where the validation is done through your

- en: In this variation, what has previously been the controller and presenter is
    now the view model. Just like with MVC and MVP, the majority of the logic is held
    within the central component, in this case the view model. The model itself is
    actually very simple in MVVM. Typically, it acts as an envelope that just holds
    data. Validation is done within the view model.
  id: totrans-92
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like with MVP, the view is totally unaware of the existence of the model.
    The difference is that, with MVP, the view was aware that it was talking to some
    intermediate class. It called methods rather than simply setting values. In MVVM
    the view believes that the view model is its view. Instead of calling operations
    like `saveCastle` and passing in data or waiting for data to be requested, the
    view updates fields on the view model as they change. In effect, the fields on
    the view are bound to the view model. The view model may proxy these values through
    to the model or wait until a commit-like operation like save is called to pass
    the data along.

  id: totrans-103

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    interaction with the view model we loop over all of its properties looking for
    changes. When changes are found, the related value in the view is updated with
    the new value. For changes to values in the view change, actions are attached
    to all the controls. These then trigger updates to the view model.

    all the properties of a large model. The number of things which can cause a model
    to change is high and there is no real way to tell if a distant field in a model
    has been changed by changing another without going and validating it. On the upside,
    dirty checking allows you to use plain old JavaScript objects. There is no need
    to write your code any differently than before. The same is not true of the other
    approach: container objects.'

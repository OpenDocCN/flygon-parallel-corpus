- en: The architecture of server-side application development for complex and large
    applications (applications with huge number of users and large volume of data)
    shouldn't just involve faster response and providing web services for wide variety
    of platforms. It should be easy to scale, upgrade, update, test, and deploy. It
    should also be highly available, allowing the developers write components of the
    server-side application in different programming languages and use different databases.
    Therefore, this leads the developers who build large and complex applications
    to switch from the common monolithic architecture to microservices architecture
    that allows us to do all this easily. As microservices architecture is being widely
    used in enterprises that build large and complex applications, it's really important
    to learn how to design and create server-side applications using this architecture.
    In this chapter, we will discuss how to create applications based on microservices
    architecture with Node.js using the Seneca toolkit.

    HTML pages or native UI that run on the user's machine, server-side application
    that runs on the server, and database that also runs on the server. The server-side
    application is responsible for handling HTTP requests, retrieving and storing
    data in a database, executing algorithms, and so on. If the server-side application
    is a single executable (that is, running is a single process) that does all these
    tasks, then we say that the server-side application is monolithic.

    A service (or microservice) is a small and independent process that constitutes
    a particular functionality of the complete server-side application. For example,

    a service is small or not. Well, it actually depends on many factors such as the
    type of application, team management, availability of resources, size of application,
    and how small you think is small. However, a small service doesn't have to be
    the one that is written is fewer lines of code or provides a very basic functionality.
    A small service can be the one on which a team of developers can work independently,
    which can be scaled independently to other services, scaling it doesn't cause
    unbalanced utilization of recourses, and overall they are highly decoupled (independent
    and unaware) of other services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    multiple services in a single computer. The ratio of server to services depends
    on different factors. A common factor is the amount and type of resources and
    technologies required. For example, if a service needs a lot of RAM and CPU time,
    then it would be better to run it individually on a server. If there are some
    services that don't need much resources, then you can run them all in a single
    server together.

    subscribe to the event and update the data. The problem with this mechanism is

    be a lot of duplicate data, and finally, it is difficult to code this kind of

    service to maintain their own database if they want to store something that they
    don't want to share with others. Services should not connect to the centralized
    database directly, instead there should be another service called **database service**
    that provides APIs to work with the centralized database. This extra layer has
    many advantages, such as the underlying schema can be changed without updating
    and redeploying all the services that are dependent on the schema, we can add
    a caching layer without making changes to the services, you can change the type
    of database without making any changes to the services and there are many other
    benefits. We can also have multiple database services if there are multiple schemas,
    or if there are different types of database, or due to some other reason that
    benefits the overall architecture and decouples the services.

    send responses, and parse data requires a lot of time and work, but a framework
    like Seneca makes all this easy. Also, converting the components of a monolithic
    core to services is also a cumbersome task as it requires a lot of code refactoring,

    core to services? Suppose you want to move an operation of monolithic core that
    is written using a function to a separate service and expose the function via
    a network, then you cannot simply copy and paste the function to the new service,
    instead you need to define a route (if you are using Express). To call the function
    inside the monolithic core, you will need to write code to make an HTTP request
    to the service. To call this operation inside the service, you can simply call
    a function so that there are two different code snippets depending from where
    you are executing the operation. Therefore, moving operations requires a lot of
    code refactoring. However, if you would have written the preceding operation using
    the Seneca action, then it would have been really easy to move the operation to
    a separate service.

    pin matches, then it sends request to this particular service. Finally, if any

- en: Seneca also provides a built-in way to map the URLs to actions, that is, requests
    made to an HTTP server can be automatically mapped to a particular action to invoke
    them. This is done using a definition object whose properties define a route mapping
    from URLs to action patterns. This built-in method defines route mapping independent
    of the framework being used. Once we have defined the definition objects, we need
    a plugin specific to the web server framework that will capture and resolve the
    URLs to action patterns using the definition objects. Definition object allows
    you to attach callbacks that will get the response of the action via a parameter,
    and then the callbacks can return the data to the user in whatever format they
    want. This can be useful in case you are creating a plugin for distribution that
    exposes a few actions that need to be called for specific URL requests, then you
    will have to use the built-in method, as it defines route mapping independent
    of the framework being used.

    a particular HTTP request with other route handers. The preceding code will behave
    in the same way even if we use `seneca.act`, but it's a good practice to use `httpRequest.seneca.act`
    as we may use such types of plugins. Your own route handlers can also use `httpRequest.seneca.act`

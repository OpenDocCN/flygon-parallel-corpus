- en: The best way to understand Seneca and microservices architecture is by building
    a server-side application that would benefit from the microservices architecture.
    In previous chapter, we saw how large and complex server-side application benefits
    from the microservices architecture and why enterprises use microservices architecture.
    In this chapter, we will build a coupon website to practically demonstrate the
    benefits of using microservices architecture and Seneca to create a server-side
    application. While building this coupon site, you will also learn how to design
    a server-side application using the microservices architecture from scratch, how
    to split the functionality of the application into services, how a client can
    directly communicate with the services, and many other things.

    to the upload service. The upload service then sends the image to the image storage
    server and adds metadata about the coupon to the database using the database service.
    We moved these operations to a different service, because if we are resizing and
    converting the uploaded image, then it will consume more memory and CPU time and
    keep the port open for more time, which will flood the server and break the monolithic
    core in case there are a large number of submissions at a time, so moving these
    operations to a different service makes sure that if there is a rise in submissions,
    it doesn''t affect the site visitors who are looking for the coupons. We won''t
    be resizing and converting images, but if you want to add this functionality,
    you can add this by simply updating the upload service. While the upload service
    is being updated, the form submissions will not work, but everything else will
    work. Therefore, we can say that this functionality can be independently updated
    without affecting other functionalities.'

- en: '**URL config service**: The client communicates with the monolithic core, image
    storage server, and upload service. In a production site, these three servers
    will remain in three different physical computers with three different IP addresses.
    So, for the client to be able to communicate with them, these three need to be
    exposed via different domain names (that is the monolithic core can be pointed
    using the main domain and the other two using sub domains) or we can use a load
    balancer or reverse proxy that supports URL rerouting so that we can have a single
    domain name and route the requests to the respective server based on the path
    of the URL. The URL config service will serve the base URL to communicate with
    these three servers. To follow this chapter, you can simply run these servers
    in the same physical computer using different ports, and when you are ready to
    make the site live, you can change the base URLs in the URL config service, depending
    on what technique you used to make the client able to communicate with the servers.
    You don''t have to modify the source code of the servers directly, which is a
    cumbersome and risky task.'

    and reliability, and it's low cost. The image storage server that we will be creating

    callback checks whether the user is logged in or not. If user is not logged in,
    we will ask the user to log in. If the user tries to log in, then we will check
    whether the username and password is correct. If the username and password are
    wrong, we will ask the user to log in again. We will parse the HTTP basic authentication
    based the headers using the `basic-auth` module, that is, we will pass the `req`
    object to the `basicAuth` function to parse it. Here we are hardcoding the username
    and password.

    button, then a request is made to the `/admin/accept` path to mark the coupon
    as verified, and when the admin clicks on the **Reject** button, a request is
    made to the `/admin/reject` path to delete the coupon. After accepting or deleting
    a coupon, the admin is redirected to the `/admin` path.

    can update the admin panel without affecting the visitors, that is, while the
    admin panel is being updated, the users will still be able to visit and browse

- en: The best way to master socket.io is by building a real-world application, which
    is what we will be doing in this chapter. A live score website shows score changes
    in real time to the user as soon as the administrator updates the scores. We will
    create a football live score website. Discussing how to build a live score website
    will help us study socket.io in depth, as it requires socket.io authentication,
    and optionally, integrating socket.io with Express. Our live score website will
    provide an admin panel for the administrators to update the score.

    you will find HTML files and CSS files for our user and administrator pages. In
    the `js` directory, you will find `admin.js` and `index.js` files, inside which
    you will place the socket.io client code for the administrator and users, respectively.
    Similarly, in the `html` directory, you will find `index.html` and `admin.html`
    files that will be served to the users and administrator respectively.

    We will use the HTTP basic authentication to protect the admin panel.

    authentication in Express.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also created a function with the name `auth`, which will be used to check
    whether the visitor is authenticated. If not, then we will send an HTTP status
    code 404, asking the visitor to provide the username and password. If the visitor
    is authenticated, then we will generate a unique number and store it as a cookie
    in the administrator's browser. Later on, this cookie will be used by the socket.io
    server to check whether the administrator is authenticated.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we created a route with the `/admin` path, which has two route handlers
    attached to it. The first one is the `auth` function to check for authentication
    and the second serves the `admin.html` file.

- en: In this chapter, we saw how to build a live score website using socket.io and
    Express. You should now be comfortable with building any kind of application that
    requires bidirectional communication in real time. You should now try building
    a chat application, multiplayer game, or something else where socket.io would
    be very useful.

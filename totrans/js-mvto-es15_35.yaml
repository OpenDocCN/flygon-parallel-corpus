- en: If you are a frontend or backend JavaScript developer who works on large and
    complex JavaScript applications and deals with a lot of code that responds to
    asynchronous data updates, user activities, and system activities, then it's perhaps
    the best time to explore **functional reactive programming** (**FRP**), as it's
    a time-saving, bug-preventing, easy-to-read, and modularized style of writing
    code. You don't need to know any functional programming language or be a hardcore
    functional language programmer; rather, you just need to know the basics of functional
    programming. In this chapter, we will learn how to use FRP using `Bacon.js`, which
    is an FRP library for both frontend and backend JavaScript.

    user activities, and system activities and propagate changes onto the dependent
    parts of the application. Reactive programming is not something new; believe it
    or not, you have already been doing reactive programming without realizing it.
    For example, the code you write to handle a button''s click event is reactive
    code. There are various approaches to reactive programming, such as event-driven,
    callback, promise patterns and FRP.'

    reactive code: **event-driven**, **callback**,and **promise**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anyone who knows a bit of JavaScript is familiar with event-driven and callback
    patterns. Although these two patterns are the most popular way of writing reactive
    code, they make it difficult to catch exceptions and result in nested function
    calls, which makes the code harder to read and debug.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the problems caused by event-driven and callback patterns, ES6 ([https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-ecmascript-6](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-ecmascript-6))
    introduced the promise pattern. The promise pattern makes the code look more like
    synchronous code, therefore making it easy to read and debug. The pattern also
    makes exception handling easier. A promise represents an asynchronous operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the promise pattern has a problem, that is, a promise can be resolved only
    once. The promise pattern can only respond to a single activity or data update
    of an asynchronous operation. For example, if we make an AJAX request using a
    promise pattern, then we can handle only *request success* and *failure* activities
    and not the states of the request and response cycle, such as weather server connections
    that have been established and response headers received. Similarly, if we handle
    a user click activity using a promise pattern, then we can handle only the first
    click, not the ones occurring after it, because the promise gets resolved in the
    first click.
  prefs: []

- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Here, the `$http()` method makes an HTTP request asynchronously and returns
    a promise. The promise is resolved if the request is successful, and the callback
    passed to the first `then()` method is invoked, that is, the promise is resolved.
    If the request fails, then the callback is passed to the `catch()` method, which
    is invoked, and the promise is rejected. The `then()` method always returns a
    promise, making it possible to run multiple asynchronous operations one after
    another. In the code, you can see how asynchronous operations are chained. What's
    important here is that the `then()` methods are invoked only once, that is, the
    promise returned by the `$http()` method can be resolved only once, and multiple
    attempts to resolve a promise will be ignored. Therefore, we cannot use promise
    patterns to write reactive code when we have to deal with multiple activities
    or data updates of an asynchronous operation.

    learn more about functional programming in the next section. Actually, the drawbacks
    of the event-driven, callback, and promise patterns weren't the real reason for
    the invention of FRP; rather, FRP was actually invented because there were demands
    for a functional pattern for reactive programming, as functional code is easy
    to write, test, debug, reuse, update, and read. But as FRP solves the problems
    caused by the event-driven, callback, and promise patterns, we can say that FRP
    is an alternative to the other patterns.

    on its input arguments and that always provides the same output for a particular
    input. If it reads anything else outside of its scope, including global variables,
    then it's not a pure function.
  prefs: []

    a function that fetches a web page or reads from the filesystem cannot guarantee
    the same return value. We should try to make as many as functions as pure as possible.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's understand EventStreams by comparing them to events in an event-driven
    pattern. Just like we subscribe to events in an event-driven pattern, we subscribe
    to EventStreams in FRP. Unlike events in event-driven programming, the power of
    EventStreams is that they can be merged, concatenated, combined, zipped, filtered,
    or transformed in any number of ways before you handle and act on the events.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    therefore, we can also merge, combine, zip, sample, filter, and transform properties.
    Merging, combining, zipping, sampling, filtering, or transforming properties gives
    us new properties. This feature is useful for writing code for the more complex
    situation of a property's value depending on another property. For example, if
    we want to ignore some values of a property while calculating the value of another
    property based on it, then we can use filter feature.

    the events of an EventStream represent the values of a property. Events in these
    EventStreams occur when their respective property value is changed. This feature
    has many benefits, one of which is that it can prevent code duplication when we
    have to trigger the same action in response to several properties changing their
    values.

    to a URL response, we need to use `flatMap` instead of `map` as instead of a callback,
    we need to make an AJAX request, and its response will be captured as a stream,
    and the stream will be returned. When the AJAX request completes, the event will
    be put inside the stream returned by the `flatMap` function.

    we log the response using `onValue`.

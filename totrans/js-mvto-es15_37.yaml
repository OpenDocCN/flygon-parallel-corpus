    This version makes Bootstrap more powerful and easy to customize and use. In this
    chapter, you will learn about the new features of Bootstrap 4 with examples. I
    will assume that you already have some knowledge of Bootstrap and know how to
    create responsive websites using it. If you are new to Bootstrap or responsive
    web design, you can find good books to learn Bootstrap from scratch from the Packt
    catalog. We will use Bootstrap 4 to design all the projects we will be building
    from this chapter onwards.'

- en: Understanding the rem and em CSS units
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bootstrap 4 has switched from `px` to `rem` and `em` wherever possible. This
    is the main reason why Bootstrap 4 is not supported in IE 8 as IE 8 doesn't support
    the `em` and `rem` units. Bootstrap 4 switched to `rem` and `em` because they
    make responsive typography and component sizing easier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are not familiar with the `rem` and `em` CSS units, then it's the right
    time to learn it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `em` unit is relative to the font size of the parent element. `1em` is equal
    to the current font size of the parent element. `2em` means two times the size
    of the current font. For example, if an element is displayed with a font size
    of `10 px`, then `2em` is `20 px`. We can achieve responsive typography and components
    by just changing the parent element's font size using CSS media queries for different
    viewport or device width sizes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As `em` sizing is nested (it depends on parent element), if you have elements
    with `1.5em` sizing and then nest some HTML with elements that also have an `em`
    declaration, their sizing multiplies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `rem` unit is similar to `em` but is relative to the font size of the HTML
    tag (root element). Therefore, it's not nested.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![The grid system](img/00121.jpeg)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: The `.col-xl-` breakpoint targets screen sizes of **1200px** or larger, which
    was targeted by `.col-lg-` in Bootstrap 3\. Therefore, this makes other breakpoints
    compress to target smaller screen sizes than they used to in Bootstrap 3\. Here,
    you can see that `.col-xs-` now targets a screen width of less than **544px**
    instead of the **768px** it did in Bootstrap 3, making it easier to target mobile
    devices and have different layouts for tablets and mobile devices, which was lacking
    in Bootstrap 3.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Bootstrap uses `em` or `rem` for defining most sizes, `px` is used for
    grid breakpoints and container widths. This is because viewport width is in pixels
    and does not change with font size.

  prefs:

    using a grid system to control width.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first card, we have a header, which is created using the `.card-header`
    class. Then, we have a card block, inside which we have a title and subtitle.
    A card block is a part of a card that has padding. Whenever you need padding in
    any part of the card, simply use the `.card-block` class. A card title is created
    using `.card-title`, and a card subtitle is created using the `.card-subtitle`
    class. The `.card-title` and `.card-subtitle` classes simply give appropriate
    margins. Then, we simply have a responsive image. After that, we have a paragraph
    using the `.card-text` class. The `.card-text` class makes sure that the last
    child element doesn't have any bottom margin. Then, we have two links with the
    `.card-link` class. `.card-link` applies a left margin to all `.card-link` classes
    from the second one. And finally, we have a card footer, which is created using
    `.card-footer`.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second card, we have a responsive image and then a block quote. We have
    added the `.card-img-top` class to the image, which adds a top-right and top-left
    border radius to the image. We have also added `.card-blockquote` to the block
    quote to remove the margin, padding, and left border from the block quote.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the third card, we simply have some text and a responsive image. We have
    added the `.card-img-bottom` class to the responsive image, which adds a bottom-right
    and bottom-left border radius to the image.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fourth card we created is for demonstrating card overlays. First, we added
    a responsive image with the `.card-img` class, which adds a border radius to all
    the corners. And then, we created an overlay using the `.card-img-overlay` class,
    which simply makes the position of the element absolute with some padding and
    no top, right, left, and bottom, thus putting the content on top of the card.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, cards use dark text and assume a light background. Add `.card-inverse`
    for white text and specify the `background-color` and `border-color` values to
    go with it. The fifth card is a demonstration of `.card-inverse`. Bootstrap 4
    also provides a few classes that add a background color and border color to cards.
    These classes are demonstrated in the last five cards.

- en: React is not enough to build a complete application, as it's just the view layer.
    We need an architecture for holding the application logic and data, and this is
    where Flux comes in. Obviously, React can be used with any other architecture,
    but Flux is what is mostly used with React, as Flux is based on unidirectional
    data flow, like React. In this chapter, we will build a single-page RSS reader
    using React and Flux.

    to broadcast actions to registered callbacks. What the dispatcher does is not
    the same as a pub/sub system, as callbacks are not subscribed to particular events.
    Instead, every action is dispatched to every registered callback. An application
    should contain only one dispatcher.'

    stores are not converted into actions.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, in Flux, all the events and data from different sources are dispatched to
    the dispatcher as actions, then the stores update themselves whenever the dispatcher
    dispatches actions, and finally, views get updated whenever stores update.

    events first go to the **Dispatcher**, then to the **Store**, and finally to the
    **View**. So, we can say that dispatcher, store, and view are the three major
    parts of the Flux architecture.

    there are many Flux frameworks, such as Fluxible, Reflux, Alt, and Redux. But
    to keep things simple and easier to learn, we will not use any of these frameworks.
    Instead, we will use the Flux.js and MicroEvent.js libraries to implement the
    Flux architecture.

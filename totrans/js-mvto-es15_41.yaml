- en: To build **single page applications** (**SPAs**) using Angular 2, we need to
    learn how to implement routing in Angular 2\. Angular 2 comes with built-in routing
    APIs, which are very powerful, feature rich, and easy to use. In this chapter,
    we will build a basic search engine template to demonstrate routing in Angular
    2\. We won't be building a complete search engine because that's out of the scope
    of this module. We will use Bootstrap 4 to design the search engine template.
    At the end of this chapter, you will be comfortable with building SPAs using Angular
    2.

    the search engine template.

- en: At first, we create the root component, called `AppComponent`. While creating
    the root component, we add the `ng.router.ROUTER_DIRECTIVES` directive to it,
    which lets us use the `routerLink` directive.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we use `ng.router.RouteConfig` to configure the routes for our application.
    We are providing an array of routes as an argument to the `ng.router.RouteConfig`
    method. A route consists of a path, component, and the name of the route. The
    paths can be static, parameterized, or wildcard, just like Express route paths.
    Here, the first route is for the home page, second for displaying the search result,
    and finally, the third for handling invalid URLs, that is, URLs for which routes
    are not defined. The `ng.router.RouteConfig` method returns a function that takes
    the root component and attaches the routes to it.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We then initialize the application. While initializing the app, we're passing
    the `ng.router.ROUTER_PROVIDERS` provider, which will be used to create instances
    of various services related to routing. Also, we are providing a custom provider,
    which returns the `/` character when an instance of the `ng.router.APP_BASE_HREF`
    service is requested. `ng.router.APP_BASE_HREF` is used to find the base URL of
    the app.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `AppComponent` template, we are displaying a navigation bar. The navigation
    bar has an `anchor` tag that doesn't have an `href` attribute; instead, we are
    using the `routerLink` directive to assign the redirect link so that when clicked
    on, instead of a complete page reload, it only changes the URL and component.
    And finally, `<router-outlet>` is what displays the component based on the current
    URL.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To populate our template, we need to generate some random search result data.
    For this, we can use the `Chance.js` library. We will generate random data on
    the server side, not on client side, so that we can later demonstrate how to make
    an HTTP request using Angular 2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`Chance.js` is available for both client-side and server-side JavaScript. We
    earlier downloaded the `Chance.js` package to use with `Node.js`. Here is the
    code to generate random data. Place it in the `app.js` file above the `/*` route
    so that `/*` doesn''t override the random data route:'

- en: Here, we first create a route for the `/getData` path, which sends an array
    of search results as a response. The route callback uses `chance.sentence()` to
    generate random titles for the search result and `chance.paragraph()` to generate
    a description.

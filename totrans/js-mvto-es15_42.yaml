- en: It's very important to scale and secure your applications. Scaling and securing
    are not one-time tasks. You need to keep making changes to your code as you add
    new features to increase application security, and as your application traffic
    and data increases, you need to scale your servers. In this chapter, you will
    learn how to make Node.js applications more secure and how to scale Node.js applications.
    I will be assuming that your are using Express for creating your web server as
    it is the most common.

    that allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance. Applications
    expose different types of vulnerability.

    various security-related HTTP headers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`Strict-Transport-Policy`: This header is used to enforce secure (HTTP over
    SSL/TLS) connections to the server. HTTPS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
    In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker secretly alters the communication between
    the client and server. This is done to steal data, add ads to web pages, and so
    on.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`X-Frame-Options`: This header provides clickjacking protection. **Clickjacking**
    is a technique by which an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers
    to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they intended
    to click on the top-level page. Thus, the attacker is "hijacking" clicks meant
    for their page and routing them to some other page, most likely owned by another
    application, domain, or both. This header prevents the application from being
    viewed inside an iFrame, therefore providing clickjacking protection.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`X-XSS-Protection`: This header prevents reflective XSS attacks. Reflective
    XSS attacks are a type of XSS attack. **Cross-Site Scripting** (**XSS**) attacks
    are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise
    benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application
    to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different
    end user. Reflected XSS is the most frequent type of XSS attack. They are also
    known as non-persistent XSS attacks since the attack payload is delivered and
    executed via a single request and response. Reflected XSS occurs when the attacker
    injects executable JavaScript code into the HTML response by injecting the code
    into the URL.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`X-Content-Type-Options`: Browsers can override response `Content-Type` headers
    to guess and process data using an implicit content type. While this can be convenient
    in some scenarios, it can also lead to some kinds of attack, such as a MIME confusion
    attack, authorized hotlinking, and so on. Returning `X-Content-Type-Options` will
    cause browsers to use the provided `Content-Type` header and not interpret the
    content as a different content type.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`Content-Security-Policy`: This header lets us provide a list of trusted sources
    to the browser, from which content such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts,
    images, and embeddable objects (Java applets, ActiveX, audio, and video) can be
    loaded onto a page. This helps us prevent XSS attacks.'

- en: For example, if an attacker is able to find a reproducible link that executes
    a specific action on the target page while the victim is logged in to it, he is
    able to embed such a link on a page he controls and trick the victim into opening
    it. The attack-carrying link may be placed in a location that the victim is likely
    to visit while logged in to the target site sent in a HTML e-mail body or attachment.

    work by embedding additional authentication data into requests, which allows the
    web application to detect requests from unauthorized locations.

    XSS attack is. There is another type of XSS attack called **stored XSS**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stored XSS occurs when the application stores user input that is not correctly
    filtered. For example, while chatting, if a message is not sanitized, then both
    users can run scripts on each other's browsers by sending JS code within `<script>`
    tags as messages.

    unavailable to its intended users temporarily. An attacker uses one or many machines
    to make continuous requests to the server to take it down.

    which uses a lot of different techniques and data from various sources to block
    malicious requests on your server. It's always better to avoid handling DoS on
    your server and leave it to a service created by DoS experts.

- en: If your application has lots of users accessing the system simultaneously, then
    obviously a single server cannot handle all the traffic. It will slow down and
    crash. Therefore, we need to deploy the application on multiple servers and then
    distribute the traffic equally between them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To distribute traffic between servers, we need to use something called a **load
    balancer**. A load balancer is a server that sits in front of the application
    servers. The client communicates with the load balancer instead of the application
    servers, and instead of handling the request, the load balancer forwards it to
    an application server; when the application servers sends the response, it sends
    the same response to the client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a load balancer doesn't actually process the request, it can handle many
    more requests than an application server. Obviously, a load balancer cannot handle
    unlimited requests, so we can use multiple load balancers. When we use multiple
    load balancers, the traffic between them is distributed by using the round-robin
    DNS technique. In round-robin DNS, the IP address of the domain pointing to the
    load balancer changes according to an appropriate statistical model.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**) provides a load balancer called Amazon ELB,
    which can be used to distribute traffic between Amazon EC2 servers, that is, application
    servers. Obviously, it difficult to predict the total number of EC2 instances
    you would need to scale your application; therefore, AWS also provides something
    called **auto scaling**, which can add/remove EC2 instances as needed. Therefore,
    to host a large-scale application, Amazon is the best choice. It also provides
    lots of other cloud services to scale and deploy your application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In case you don't want to worry about scaling, deploying, and managing your
    servers, then you can use cloud services such as Heroku, which makes it much easier
    to achieve all this, and you just need to worry about the application code—that's
    it.

    Node.js applications. We saw various vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.
    Make sure you take regular backups of your data so that even if your app is hacked,
    you will still have a chance to get the application running again as the data
    is not lost. Obviously, there is a lot more to learn about scaling and securing
    Node.js applications as this is an unending topic and new things come up regularly.

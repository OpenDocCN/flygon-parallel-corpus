    chapter. Now, let's see the fundamentals behind JavaScript syntax, variables,
    arithmetic operators, and comments.

    create new data; however, anything that isn't data simply does not exist. In JavaScript,
    we need to handle data to develop a website.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand the basic syntax of JavaScript, first of all you need to know
    that JavaScript is *case sensitive*. You cannot interchange lower case and upper
    case letters in JavaScript. Therefore, when dealing with the JavaScript syntax,
    you need to remember that writing the code is not the only important task, you
    must also watch the syntax whether it's written correctly.
  prefs: []

- en: Let me show you an example. In the previous chapter, you have successfully printed
    **Hello World** on your browser using the `document.write();` syntax.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What would happen if you wrote `Document.write("Hello World");`? Yes! It won't
    run successfully. You will get an error message. This kind of errors is known
    as **Uncaught SyntaxError**.

- en: A JavaScript statement is typically written on one line. You may finish your
    statement with a semicolon or not. It is not mandatory to end a statement with
    a semicolon. However, it is a good practice to add a semicolon after each statement.

    only contains a group of *characters* or, as some people also call it, **string**.
    Your age is an **integer** type data. Your grade is a **float** type data. The
    wonderful thing in JavaScript is that you do not have to specify the data type
    before writing a *variable's* name.

    is an example of string"`), numbers (for example, `2015`, `3.1415`, and so on),
    and Boolean (for example, `true` or `false`).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Did we discuss *variables*? Well, you already know the data types. You will
    need *something* to store your data. This *something* is called *variable*. In
    JavaScript, we use `var` before the variable names. Remember that `var` starts
    with small letter.

- en: An assignment operator assigns a value to an operator. I believe that you already
    know about assignment operators, don't you? Well, you use an equal sign (`=`)
    between a variable and its value. By doing this, you assigned the value to the
    variable.

    later it is multiplied by `2`. The final number (`3 x 2 = 6`) is assigned to the
    same `x` variable. That''s why we got the following output:'

    JavaScript variables and how to assign a value to a variable. You learned how
    to comment on the code. You now know why commenting is important. You finally
    learned an important topic: operators and operations. JavaScript, without using
    operators and logical functions, will not be so rich nowadays. Therefore, learning
    about the logical operations is the key to gain good knowledge of JavaScript.'

    You just type them on the console, avoid copying and pasting the codes. This will
    hamper with your learning. As a programmer must have a good typing speed, copying
    and pasting the codes will not improve this skill. You may face problems in typing
    codes; however, you will learn.

    your logic is true or false on console. If you can do this, we can move on to
    the next chapter, [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Introducing HTML and CSS"),
    *Introducing HTML and CSS*, where you will learn about HTML, CSS, and so on.

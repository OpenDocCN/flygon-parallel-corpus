    comment in the previous chapter. We used console for these purposes. Now, how
    about you learn something interesting, which will pave the way for you to be a
    good JavaScript programmer? In this chapter, we are going to study about the **HyperText
    Markup Language** (**HTML**) syntax, **Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) syntax,
    and how to use JavaScript in an HTML page.

    web browser are built with HTML. Go to any website (for example, [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com))
    and press *Ctrl* + *U* (on Mac, click *command* + *U*) on your keyboard, you will
    get the web page's source code. This works on all modern web browsers, such as
    Firefox, Google Chrome, UC, and so on.

- en: HTML is a markup language. What does it mean? Well, a markup language processes
    and presents texts using specific codes for formatting, styling, and layout design.
    There are a lot of markup languages (for example, **Business Narrative Markup
    Language** (**BNML**), **ColdFusion Markup Language** (**CFML**), **Opera** **Binary
    Markup Language** (**OBML**), **Systems** **Biology Markup Language** (**SBML**),
    **Virtual Human Markup Language** (**VHML**), and so on); however, in modern web,
    we use HTML. HTML is based on **Standard Generalized Markup Language** (**SGML**).
    SGML was basically used to design document papers.

    to demonstrate the structure.
  prefs: []

- en: An HTML tag is nothing but a few predefined words between the less than sign
    (`<`) and greater than sign (`>`). Therefore, the structure of a tag is `<WORD>`,
    where `WORD` is the predefined text that is recognized by the Internet browsers.
    This type of tag is called open tag. There is another type of tag that is known
    as close tag. The structure of a close tag is similar to `</WORD>`. You just have
    to put a forward slash after the less than sign.

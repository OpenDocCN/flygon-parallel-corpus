- en: This book is about being a better JavaScript developer. So, throughout the chapters,
    you will not only learn about writing tests in the Jasmine 'idiom', but also about
    the best practices in writing software in the JavaScript language. It is about
    acknowledging JavaScript as a real platform for application development and leveraging
    all its potential. It is also about tooling and automation and how to make your
    life easier and more productive.

    through the development of a simple stock market Investment Tracker application.
    It starts with the basics of testing through the development of the base domain
    classes (such as stock and investment), passes through the concepts of maintainable
    browser code, and concludes with a full refactoring to a React.js application
    build on ECMA Script 6 modules and automated build.

    you learn the thought process behind thinking in terms of test-driven development.
    You will code your very first JavaScript functionality driven by tests. You will
    also learn the basic functions of Jasmine and how to structure your tests. Also
    demonstrated, is how Jasmine matchers work and how you can create one of your
    own to improve your tests'' code readability.'

- en: It is an exciting time to be a JavaScript developer; technologies have matured,
    web browsers are more standardized, and there are new things to play with every
    day. JavaScript has become an established language, and the Web is the true open
    platform of today. We've seen the rise of single-page web applications, the proliferation
    of **Model View Controller** (**MVC**) frameworks, such as Backbone.js and AngularJS,
    the use of JavaScript on the server with Node.js, and even mobile applications
    created entirely with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS using technologies such as PhoneGap.

- en: From its humble beginnings with handling HTML forms, to the massive applications
    of today, the JavaScript language has come very far, and with it, a number of
    tools have matured to ensure that you can have the same level of quality with
    it that you have with any other language.

- en: There are many complications when dealing with client JavaScript code; the obvious
    one, is that you cannot control the client's runtime. While on the server, you
    can run a specific version of your Node.js server, you can't oblige your clients
    to run the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The JavaScript language is defined by the ECMAScript specification; therefore,
    each browser can have its own implementation of a runtime, which means there could
    be small differences or bugs between them.
  prefs: []

- en: Besides that, you have issues with the language itself. Brendan Eich developed
    JavaScript in just 10 days, under a lot of management pressure at Netscape. Although
    it got itself right in its simplicity, first-class functions, and object prototypes,
    it also introduced some problems with the attempt to make the language malleable
    and allow it to evolve.

    do to prevent a module from overwriting pieces of other modules. The following
    code illustrates how simple it is to overwrite the global `console.log` function:'

- en: This was a conscious decision on the language design; it allows developers to
    tinker and add missing functionality to the language. But given such power, it
    is relatively easy to make a mistake.

- en: Version 5 of the ECMA specification introduced the `Object.seal` function, which
    prevents further changes on any object once called. But its current support is
    not widespread; Internet Explorer, for example, only implemented it on its version
    9.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem, is with how JavaScript deals with type. In other languages,
    an expression like `'1' + 1` would probably raise an error; in JavaScript, due
    to some non-intuitive type coercion rules, the aforementioned code results in
    `'11'`. But the main problem is in its inconsistency; on multiplication, a string
    is converted into a number, so `'3' * 4`, is actually `12`.

- en: Jasmine is a little **behavior-driven development** (BDD) test framework created
    by the developers at Pivotal Labs, to allow you to write automated JavaScript
    unit tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But before we can go any further, first we need to get some fundamentals right,
    starting with what a test unit is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A test unit is a piece of code that tests a functionality unit of the application
    code. But sometimes, it can be tricky to understand what a functionality unit
    can be, so for that reason, Dan North came up with a solution in the form of BDD,
    which is a rethink of **test-driven development** (**TDD**).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In traditional unit testing practice, the developer is left with loose guidelines
    on how to start the process of testing, what to test, how big a test should be,
    or even how to call a test.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To fix these problems, Dan took the concept of **user stories** from the standard
    agile construct, as a model on how to write tests.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Jasmine, as with other BDD frameworks, each acceptance criterion directly
    translates to a test unit. For that reason, each test unit is usually called a
    **spec**, short for specification. During the course of this book, we will be
    using this terminology.

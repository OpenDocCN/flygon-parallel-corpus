    with the AWS native storage solution **Elastic Block Store** (**EBS**). Amazon
    EBS provides network attached storage as a service, and is the primary solution
    used to provide block storage to EC2 instances.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nearly every EC2 instance launched is backed by an EBS root volume (created
    from an AMI machine image). Because EBS storage is network attached, if an underlying
    machine hosting an EC2 instance fails in some way, the data stored on the volume
    is safe as it is automatically replicated across multiple physical storage devices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to being used to store the root filesystem of EC2 instances, additional
    EBS volumes can be attached to EC2 instances and mounted on demand via the AWS
    API. Kubernetes integration with AWS EBS makes use of this to provide persistent
    volumes that can be used by your pods. If a pod is killed and is replaced by a
    pod on another EC2 instance, Kubernetes will handle detaching the EBS volume from
    the old EC2 instance and attaching it to the new instance, ready to be mounted
    into the new pod as required.

    make use of additional volumes. We will then look at the abstractions Kubernetes
    provides for dealing with storage that provides persistence (such as EBS). We

    your pods, in the second half of this chapter we will look at stateful sets, the
    abstraction that Kubernetes provides to run a set of pods, each of which can have
    its own attached storage and an identity that remains even if rescheduled to another
    node. This is the final piece of the puzzle required if you want to run complex
    stateful applications on your Kubernetes cluster, such as databases.

    kind of volume available `emptyDir` is just a temporary directory that is linked
    to the life cycle of a pod. When the volume is created, it is empty as the name
    suggests, and remains on the node until the pod is removed from the node. The
    data you store inside the volume does persist between pod restarts on the same
    node, so can be useful for processes that need to cache expensive computations
    on the filesystem, or for processes that checkpoint their progress. In [Chapter
    1](19821a2b-bb32-408d-9f21-256dce5d644e.xhtml), *Google's Infrastructure for the
    Rest of Us*, we discussed some other possible uses for an `emptyDir` volume to

    in our pod is almost as simple as using an `emptyDir` volume. The lowest level
    and simplest way to mount an EBS volume is by using the `awsElasticBlockStore`
    volume type. This volume type handles attaching the EBS volume to the node where
    our pod will run and then mounting the volume into a path in our container.

    a storage class (see the next section). `PersistentVolumeClaim` is normally embedded
    within a pod spec. When a pod is scheduled, its `PersistentVolumeClaim` is matched
    to a particular `PersistentVolume` that is big enough to fulfill the requested
    amount of storage. `PersistentVolume` is bound to its requesting `PersistentVolumeClaim`,
    so that even if a pod is rescheduled, the same underlying volume will be attached

    can be three times more expensive. So, you should only use `io1` volumes where

- en: With the trend of microservices architecture in the recent years, a monolithic
    application is refactored into multiple microservices. Container simplifies the
    deployment of the application build from microservices. Container management,
    automation, and orchestration have become crucial problems. Kubernetes is here
    to solve these.

- en: This book is a practical guide that provides step-by-step tips and examples
    to help you build and run your own Kubernetes cluster in both private and public
    clouds. Following along with the book will lead you to understanding how to deploy
    and manage your application and services in Kubernetes. You will also gain a deep
    understanding of how to scale and update live containers, and how to do port forwarding
    and network routing in Kubernetes. You will learn how to build a robust high-availability
    cluster with the book's hands-on examples. Finally, you will build a Continuous
    Delivery pipeline by integrating Jenkins, Docker registry, and Kubernetes.

- en: If you've been playing with Docker containers for a while and want to orchestrate
    your containers in a modern way, this book is the right choice for you. This book
    is for those who already understand Docker and container technology, and want
    to explore further to find better ways to orchestrate, manage, and deploy containers.
    This book is perfect for going beyond a single container and working with container
    clusters, learning how to build your own Kubernetes, and making it work seamlessly
    with your Continuous Delivery pipeline.

- en: Throughout the book, we use at least three servers with a Linux-based OS to
    build all of the components in Kubernetes. At the beginning of the book, you could
    use one machine, whether it is Linux or Windows, to learn about the concepts and
    basic deployment. From a scalability point of view, we recommend you start with
    three servers in order to scale out the components independently and push your
    cluster to the production level.

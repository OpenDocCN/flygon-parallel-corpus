    Kubernetes system. In order to realize your application in a microservices structure,
    reading the recipes in this chapter will be a good start towards understanding
    the concepts of the Kubernetes resources and consolidating them. After you deploy
    applications in Kubernetes, you can work on its scalable and efficient container
    management, and also fulfill the DevOps delivering procedure of microservices.

    has an annotation `storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true` on.
    Removing that annotation can disable the dynamic provisioning. Moving the annotation

    a Namespace. Using a Kubernetes Namespace could separate user spaces for different
    environments in the same cluster. It gives you the flexibility of creating an
    isolated environment and partitioning resources to different projects and teams.
    You may consider Namespace as a virtual cluster. Pods, Services, and Deployments
    are contained in a certain Namespace. Some low-level resources, such as nodes
    and `persistentVolumes`, do not belong to any Namespace.

    Integration/Continuous Delivery** (**CI/CD**) pipelines using the most popular
    CI/CD tools on both self-managed public clouds and SaaS solutions using Kubernetes.
    After following the recipes in this chapter, you will have gained the skills needed
    to build, deploy, and promote applications from development to a production environment.
    You will be able to use the tools that we will implement in these recipes to detect
    bugs, anti-patterns, and license concerns during the continuous integration process.

- en: The final platform we are going to be looking at is called OpenFaaS. This is
    a relatively new project and has only gained support for Kubernetes, so we will
    not be going into too much detail. However, the project is gaining a lot of traction
    and supporters, so I believe it is important we mention it.

- en: OpenFaaS was started in December 2016 by Alex Ellis, just over a year to the
    day before I am writing this. Initially, it was designed to work with Docker swarm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker swarm is Docker's own clustering technology; it allows you to link some
    hosts running the Docker Engine together. On the face of it, Docker swarm is quite
    similar to Kubernetes. However, the further you delve into the workings of both
    technologies, you will find that they not only work differently, but also have
    been designed to fill different gaps.

- en: Since its first commit in December 2016, OpenFaaS has gotten a lot of attention
    from the Docker world. Ellis and the other OpenFaaS community members have spoken
    at DockerCon Europe, Moby Summit, KubeCon, and Gluecon, as well as numerous meetups
    over the course of the last 12 months. OpenFaaS was also included in the InfoWorld
    Bossie Awards 2017 as one of the best cloud-computing software projects of 2017.

- en: OpenFaaS is probably the most feature-rich Function as a Service offering, and
    it supports Docker swarm, so it made sense that a Kubernetes version of the software
    would eventually be released—this Kubernetes version is called **faas-netes**
    and it had its first commit in July 2017.

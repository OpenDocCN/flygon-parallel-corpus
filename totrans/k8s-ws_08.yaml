    kinds of objects that we have created in previous chapters and make them discoverable
    from both within and outside our cluster. This chapter also introduces the concept
    of Kubernetes Services and explains how to use them to expose the application
    deployed using controllers such as Deployments. By the end of this chapter, you
    will be able to make your application accessible to the external world. You will
    also know about the different types of Services and be able to use them to make
    different sets of pods interact with each other.

- en: In the past few chapters, we learned about Pods and Deployments, which help
    us run containerized applications. Now that we are equipped to deploy our applications,
    in this chapter, we will take a look at some API objects that help us with the
    networking setup to ensure that our users can reach our application and that the
    different components of our application, as well as different applications, can
    work together.
  prefs: []

- en: As we have seen in the previous chapters, each Kubernetes Pod gets its IP address.
    However, setting up networking and connecting everything is not as simple as coding
    in Pod IP addresses. We can't rely on a single Pod to run our applications reliably.
    Due to this, we use a Deployment to ensure that, at any given moment, we will
    have a fixed number of specific kinds of Pods running in the cluster. However,
    this means that during the runtime of our application, we can tolerate the failure
    of a certain number of Pods as new pods are automatically created to replace them.
    Hence, the IP addresses of these Pods don't stay the same. For example, if we
    have a set of Pods running the frontend application that need to talk to another
    set of Pods running the backend application inside our cluster, we need to find
    a way to make the Pods discoverable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To solve this problem, we use Kubernetes Services. Services allow us to make
    a logical set of Pods (for example, all pods managed by a Deployment) discoverable
    and accessible for other Pods running inside the same cluster or to the external
    world.

- en: A Service defines policies by which a logical set of Pods can be accessed. Kubernetes
    Services enable communication between various components of our application, as
    well as between different applications. Services help us connect the application
    with other applications or users. For example, let's say we have a set of Pods
    running the frontend of an application, a set of Pods running the backend, and
    another set of Pods connecting the data source. The frontend is the one that users
    need to interact with directly. The frontend then needs to connect to the backend,
    which, in turn, needs to talk to the external data source.

    based on their survey results. Using a bit of simplification, we can imagine three
    Deployments – one that runs the forms'' frontend to collect the data, another
    that validates and stores the data, and a third one that runs the data visualization
    application. The following diagram should help you visualize how Services would
    come into the picture for routing traffic and exposing different components:'

- en: Hence, the abstraction of Services helps in keeping the different parts of the
    application decoupled and enables communication between them. In legacy (non-Kubernetes)
    environments, you may expect different components to be linked together by the
    IP addresses of different VMs or bare-metal machines running different resources.
    When working with Kubernetes, the predominant way of linking different resources
    together is using labels and label selectors, which allows a Deployment to easily
    replace failed Pods or scale the number of Deployments as needed. Thus, you can
    think of a Service as a translation layer between the IP addresses and label selector-based
    mechanism of linking different resources. Hence, you just need to point toward
    a Service, and it will take care of routing the traffic to the appropriate application,
    regardless of how many replica Pods are associated with the application or which
    nodes these Pods are running on.

    stateless parts in the Kubernetes cluster can still access the other production
    Services, such as database storage or other backend Services/APIs. In such a case,
    we can simply create an ExternalName Service so that our Pods from the new cluster
    can still access resources from the old cluster, which are outside the bounds

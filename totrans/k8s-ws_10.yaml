    from the application itself and the advantages of taking this approach. By the
    end of this chapter, you will be able to define Kubernetes ConfigMap and Secret
    objects, run a simple Pod that uses data from ConfigMaps and Secrets, describe
    the advantages of decoupling configuration data from applications, and use ConfigMaps
    and Secrets to decouple application configuration data from the application container.

- en: In *Chapter 5*, *Pods*, we learned that Pods are the minimal unit of deployment
    in Kubernetes. Pods can have multiple containers, and each container can have
    a container image associated with it. This container image generally packages
    the target application that you plan to run. Once the developers are satisfied
    that the code is running as expected, the next step is to promote the code to
    testing, integration, and production environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Easy, right? One problem, however, is that as we move our packaged container
    from one environment to another, although the application remains the same, it
    needs environment-specific data, for example, the database URL to connect to.
    To overcome this problem, we can write our applications in such a way that the
    environment-specific data is provided to the application by the environment it
    is being deployed into.

    Once the data is defined and loaded into Kubernetes, the second step is to provide
    the defined data to your application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, what if you have sensitive data, such as database passwords, that you
    want to provide to your application container? Well, Kubernetes **Secret** provides
    a way to define sensitive data to an application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ConfigMap and Secret objects both serve a similar purpose. Both provide a way
    to define data that can be injected into your applications so that the same container
    can be used across different environments. There is little difference between
    them, which we will learn in detail later on in this chapter. As a quick rule,
    Secrets are designed to hold confidential data (such as passwords, private keys,
    and more), while ConfigMaps are more suited for general configuration data such
    as a database location. ConfigMaps and Secrets reside in the specific namespace
    in which they are created. They can only be referenced by Pods residing in the
    same namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to store all the objects defined in Kubernetes. As ConfigMaps and Secrets are
    Kubernetes objects, they get stored in the internal key-value store.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A ConfigMap allows us to define application-related data. A ConfigMap decouples
    the application data from the application so that the same application can be
    ported across different environments. It also provides a way to inject customized
    data into running services from the same container image.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ConfigMaps can be created through a literal value or from a file or all the
    files in a directory. Note that the primary data we stored in ConfigMaps is for
    non-sensitive configuration, for example, config files or environment variables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a ConfigMap is defined, it will be loaded to the application via an environment
    variable or a set of files. The application can then see the files as local files
    and can read from them. It is important to note that (from 1.9.6 version onward
    of Kubernetes), files loaded from ConfigMaps are read-only. ConfigMaps can also
    hold configuration data for system applications such as operators and controllers.

- en: Let's understand this through an example. Imagine that you have written a web
    application that connects to a database to store information. When you deploy
    the application in a development environment, you will want to connect to the
    development database. Once you are satisfied that the application is working correctly,
    you will want to deploy the application to a testing environment. Since the application
    is packaged in a container, you would not want to change the container to deploy
    the application to the testing environment. But to run the application in the
    testing environment, you need to connect to a different database. An easy solution
    to this is that you configure your application to read the database server URL
    from a file, and that file can be mounted through a ConfigMap. This way, the file
    is not packaged as part of the container, but injected from outside via Kubernetes;
    thus, you do not need to modify your containerized application. Another use case
    would be that external software vendors can provide a container image, and any
    specific configuration settings can be mounted on the image as per a specific
    client's requirements.

    different environments in our IT systems (for example, in test and production).
    Using the same container across different environments provides a way for secure
    and trusted code promotion techniques for IT processes. Each team can use a container
    as a unit of deployment and sign the container so that other parties can trust
    the container. This also provides a trusted way of distributing code not only
    across the same IT organizations but also across multiple organizations. For example,
    a software vendor can just provide you with a container as packaged software.
    ConfigMaps and Secrets can then be used to provide specific configurations for
    using the packaged software in your organization.

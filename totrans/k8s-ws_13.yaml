    workloads running in our cluster. We will also understand a rough threat model
    and apply it to architect a secure cluster so that we can defend our cluster and
    application against various types of threats. By the end of this chapter, you
    will be able to create Role and ClusterRole, as well as RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding
    to control the access of any process or user to the Kubernetes API server and
    objects. Then, you will learn how to create a NetworkPolicy to restrict communication
    between your application and the database. You will also learn how to create a
    PodSecurityPolicy to ensure that the running components of your application are
    conforming to the defined limits.

    After that, we're going to introduce a few of the security primitives of Kubernetes
    and how we can combat the most common forms of attack. Finally, we'll further
    modify our application and demonstrate how some of these security primitives work.

    443 exposed for serving web traffic, but it also acts as an entry point for any
    potential attackers. It may have a web management console exposed at a certain
    port. It may have certain other management ports open and API access to allow
    other software to manage it for automation purposes. The application runtime may
    need to regularly handle sensitive data. The entire end-to-end pipeline meant
    to create and deliver the application could expose various points that are vulnerable
    to compromise. The encryption algorithms that an application relies on may be
    compromised or made obsolete due to the increased sophistication of brute-force
    attacks. All these represent the various areas where our application could be
    subject to an attack.

    about where threats to our system might exist in various parts of a modern cloud
    native application stack. This mental model is called "The 4Cs of Cloud Native
    Security," and we'll be using it to organize our exploration of the security primitives
    of Kubernetes. Ideally, by leveraging all these primitives, this should give you
    a good level of confidence in your application's resistance to STRIDE-like attacks,

    compute, networking, and storage. As such, in many respects, Kubernetes is *exactly
    like a cloud platform*. It is important to understand this equivalence because
    this mental abstraction allows us to reason differently as a cluster operator
    versus a cluster developer. A cluster operator would want to ensure that all the
    components *of* the cluster were secure and hardened against any workload. A cluster
    developer would concern themselves with ensuring that the workload they are defining
    for Kubernetes is running securely inside the cluster.

    least privilege." For example, if you are a software engineer for a credit card
    processing company, **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard** (**PCI DSS**)
    compliance requires that you shouldn't have access to production clusters and
    customer data. Therefore, if you did have access to a cluster in production, you
    should have a role that has no privileges.

    server that controls access to that data. If the marketing website doesn''t need

    API server access, and also applied a NetworkPolicy to prevent unnecessary network
    communication. The next most important area of security outside the network is
    the application runtime. Attackers need access to the network to get in and out,
    but they also need a vulnerable runtime to do anything more serious. This is where
    Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicy objects help prevent that from happening.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To understand exactly how PodSecurityPolicies can be useful, let's consider
    the following scenario. You are a Kubernetes cluster admin at a large financial
    institution. Your company uses ticket-based change management software in an ITIL-compliant
    fashion (ITIL is a standardized change management framework for IT services) to
    ensure that changes that are made to the environment are stable. This prevents
    developers from doing anything disastrous in production. To keep up with the change
    of pace in the market that your customers are demanding, you need a programmatic
    way to enable developers to do more change management autonomously. But you also
    need to do so in a way that is secure and compliant with certain standards. PodSecurityPolicies
    help us do this because they allow administrators to create policy definitions
    in software that are enforced when a Pod is being admitted to a cluster. This
    means that developers can move more rapidly, and cluster admins can still certify
    that their environment is fully compliant with the set standards.

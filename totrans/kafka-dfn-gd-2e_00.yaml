- en: 'The first edition of *Kafka: The Definitive Guide* was published five years
    ago. At the time, we estimated that Apache Kafka was used in 30% of Fortune 500
    companies. Today, over 70% of Fortune 500 companies are using Apache Kafka. It
    is still one of the most popular open source projects in the world and is at the
    center of a huge ecosystem.'

- en: Why all the excitement? I think it is because there has been a huge gap in our
    infrastructure for data. Traditionally, data management was all about storage—the
    file stores and databases that keep our data safe and let us look up the right
    bit at the right time. Huge amounts of intellectual energy and commercial investment
    have been poured into these systems. But a modern company isn’t just one piece
    of software with one database. A modern company is an incredibly complex system
    built out of hundreds or even thousands of custom applications, microservices,
    databases, SaaS layers, and analytics platforms. And increasingly, the problem
    we face is how to connect all this up into one company and make it all work together
    in real time.

    motion. And right at the heart of that movement is Apache Kafka, which has become
    the de facto foundation to any platform for data in motion.

- en: 'Through this journey, Kafka hasn’t remained static. What started as a bare-bones
    commit log has evolved as well: adding connectors and stream processing capabilities,
    and reinventing its own architecture along the way. The community not only evolved
    existing APIs, configuration options, metrics, and tools to improve Kafka’s usability
    and reliability, but we’ve also introduced a new programmatic administration API,
    the next generation of global replication and DR with MirrorMaker 2.0, a new Raft-based
    consensus protocol that allows for running Kafka in a single executable, and true
    elasticity with tiered storage support. Perhaps most importantly, we’ve made Kafka
    a no-brainer in critical enterprise use cases by adding support for advanced security
    options—authentication, authorization, and encryption.'

- en: As Kafka evolves, we see the use cases evolve as well. When the first edition
    was published, most Kafka installations were still in traditional on-prem data
    centers using traditional deployment scripts. The most popular use cases were
    ETL and messaging; stream processing use cases were still taking their first steps.
    Five years later, most Kafka installations are in the cloud, and many are running
    on Kubernetes. ETL and messaging are still popular, but they are joined by event-driven
    microservices, real-time stream processing, IoT, machine learning pipelines, and
    hundreds of industry-specific use cases and patterns that range from claims processing
    in insurance companies to trading systems in banks to helping power real-time
    game play and personalization in video games and streaming services.

- en: Even as Kafka expands to new environments and use cases, writing applications
    that use Kafka well and deploy it confidently in production requires acclimating
    to Kafka’s unique way of thinking. This book covers everything developers and
    SREs need to use Kafka to its full potential, from the most basic APIs and configuration
    to the latest and most cutting-edge capabilities. It covers not just what you
    can do with Kafka and how to do it, but also what not to do and antipatterns to
    avoid. This book can be a trusted guide to the world of Kafka for both new users
    and experienced practitioners.

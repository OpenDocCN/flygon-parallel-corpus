- en: 'The greatest compliment you can give an author of a technical book is “This
    is the book I wish I had when I got started with this subject.” This is the goal
    we set for ourselves when we started writing this book. We looked back at our
    experience writing Kafka, running Kafka in production, and helping many companies
    use Kafka to build software architectures and manage their data pipelines, and
    we asked ourselves, “What are the most useful things we can share with new users
    to take them from beginner to expert?” This book is a reflection of the work we
    do every day: run Apache Kafka and help others use it in the best ways.'

    Kafka in production and build robust and performant applications on top of it.
    We highlighted the popular use cases: message buses for event-driven microservices,
    stream-processing applications, and large-scale data pipelines. We also focused
    on making the book general and comprehensive enough so it will be useful to anyone
    using Kafka, no matter the use case or architecture. We cover practical matters
    such as how to install and configure Kafka and how to use the Kafka APIs, and
    we also dedicate space to Kafka’s design principles and reliability guarantees,
    and explore several of Kafka’s delightful architecture details: the replication
    protocol, controller, and storage layer. We believe that knowledge of Kafka’s
    design and internals is not only a fun read for those interested in distributed
    systems but is also incredibly useful for those who are seeking to make informed
    decisions when they deploy Kafka in production and design applications that use
    Kafka. The better you understand how Kafka works, the more you can make informed
    decisions regarding the many trade-offs that are involved in engineering.'

- en: One of the problems in software engineering is that there is always more than
    one way to do anything. Platforms such as Apache Kafka provide plenty of flexibility,
    which is great for experts but makes for a steep learning curve for beginners.
    Very often, Apache Kafka tells you how to use a feature but not why you should
    or shouldn’t use it. Whenever possible, we try to clarify the existing choices,
    the tradeoffs involved, and when you should and shouldn’t use the different options
    presented by Apache Kafka.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Kafka: The Definitive Guide* was written for software engineers who develop
    applications that use Kafka’s APIs, and for production engineers (also called
    SREs, DevOps, or sysadmins) who install, configure, tune, and monitor Kafka in
    production. We also wrote the book with data architects and data engineers in
    mind—those responsible for designing and building an organization’s entire data
    infrastructure. Some of the chapters, especially Chapters [3](ch03.html#writing_messages_to_kafka),
    [4](ch04.html#reading_data_from_kafka), and [14](ch14.html#stream_processing),
    are geared toward Java developers. Those chapters assume that the reader is familiar
    with the basics of the Java programming language, including topics such as exception
    handling and concurrency. Other chapters, especially Chapters [2](ch02.html#installing_kafka),
    [10](ch10.html#cross_cluster_mirroring), [12](ch12.html#administering_kafka),
    and [13](ch13.html#monitoring_kafka), assume the reader has some experience running
    Linux and some familiarity with storage and network configuration in Linux. The
    rest of the book discusses Kafka and software architectures in more general terms
    and does not assume special knowledge.'

- en: Another category of people who may find this book interesting are the managers
    and architects who don’t work directly with Kafka but work with the people who
    do. It is just as important that they understand the guarantees that Kafka provides
    and the trade-offs that their employees and coworkers will need to make while
    building Kafka-based systems. The book can provide ammunition to managers who
    would like to get their staff trained in Apache Kafka or ensure that their teams
    know what they need to know.

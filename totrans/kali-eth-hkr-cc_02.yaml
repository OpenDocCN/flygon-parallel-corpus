- en: The scan results of filtered and unfiltered ports depends on whether a firewall
    being used is stateful or stateless. A stateful firewall checks if an incoming
    ACK packet is part of an existing connection or not. It blocks it if the packets
    are not part of any requested connection. Hence, the port will show up as filtered
    during a scan.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Idle scan works on the basis of a predictable IPID or an IP fragmentation ID
    of the zombie host. First, the IPID of the zombie host is checked and then a connection
    request is spoofed from that host to the target host. If the port is open, an
    acknowledgment is sent back to the zombie host which **resets** (**RST**) the
    connection as it has no history of opening such a connection. Next, the attacker
    checks the IPID on the zombie again; if it has changed by one step it implies
    an RST was received from the target. But if the IPID has changed by two steps
    it means a packet was received by the zombie host from the target host and there
    was an RST on the zombie host, which implies that the port is open.

    us find a lot of information about a company. It can be used to find email accounts,
    subdomains, and so on. In this recipe, we will learn how to use it to discover
    data.

    Google, Google CSE, Bing, Bing API, PGP, LinkedIn, Google Profiles, people123,
    Jigsaw, Twitter, and Google Plus sources.

- en: There is no point starting a pentest against a web application without knowing
    what the actual technology behind it is. For example, it would be absolutely useless
    to run dirsearch to look for files with the extension `.php` when the technology
    is actually ASP.NET. So, in this recipe, we will learn to use a simple tool `whatweb`
    to understand the technology behind a web app. It comes by default in Kali.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `masscan` tool is an amazing tool; it is the fastest port scan tool. It
    is supposed to scan the entire internet when it transmits at a speed of 10 million
    packets per second. It is a good alternative for Nmap when we know exactly what
    ports we are looking for in a network.
  prefs: []

    all ports must be specified using `-p`.

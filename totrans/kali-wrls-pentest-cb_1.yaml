    the use of wireless communications. Wi-Fi is used in many locations, including
    the home, the workplace, airports, coffee shops, retail shops, and many other
    areas too numerous to name.

    that there is a lot of valuable information that is traversing these networks.
    It is due to this information and the inherent weaknesses in these networks that
    they are common targets for those wishing to steal access, or information, or
    both.

    you to the tools in Kali Linux designed to audit wireless network, and the other
    to show some of the different attacks that are possible. This approach will serve
    to give you not only information on the attacks and how they work, but also give
    you valuable insight into reducing the likelihood or effectiveness of these attacks.

    RAM, if not more (I personally have 8 GB or 16 GB in the systems I use respectively,
    but I have used 4 GB of memory in the past and been fine).

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you have confirmed or upgraded your system's hardware as needed you now
    need to choose how you will install Kali. Kali offers several different ways to
    install and run the product each having its own benefits, but also with their
    own drawbacks as well. However, for this book we will assume one of two options,
    these being physical installation on a PC and within a virtual environment.
  prefs: []

- en: Virtualized versus physical
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The question of using virtualization instead of installing directly on a system
    is one issue that you should consider. Virtualization is a common option that
    has been employed for many years by organizations large and small, with many organizations
    using it liberally for various needs. For many the driving force for moving to
    virtualization can be many factors, including consolidation of systems, saving
    power, optimizing hardware usage, isolation of applications and systems, ease
    of management as well as testing just to name a few.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, for a penetration tester, the use of virtualization tends to be a bit
    different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the motives on the pentester side is being able to run your testing environment
    in different configurations on top of a host. For example, running Microsoft Windows
    as a host with one or more Kali environments running as guests in a virtualized
    environment on top of the system allows for consolidation, along with the ability
    to have specialized configurations as needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another reason for the move to virtualization is to make use of what is known
    as **isolation** or **sandboxing**. Basically, this means that the guest system
    is separated from the host system allowing both access off of system to the network
    and internet without letting the two potentially interfere with one another. This
    would be vital in situations when the tools and skills being used in the guest
    may have the ability to harm or compromise the host or other systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you don't get something for nothing and not everything is ideal in
    every situation and virtualization is not any different. One area which can prove
    problematic is in relation to hardware support. In some cases, physical devices
    may not be able to function in the way you need them to function due to the virtualization
    technology. One example is wireless networking and Bluetooth; these technologies
    may require that Kali is run directly on the hardware instead of within a virtual
    environment. While this limitation is not common it can be frustrating. Of course,
    I would be remiss if I didn't mention that there are workarounds and it is possible
    to get some hardware options to work in a virtualized environment that wouldn't
    otherwise, but these workarounds can be very complex and specialized, and are
    beyond the scope of this work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I must note that, on some virtualization platforms, it is possible to use USB
    pass-through to enable the use of an external USB adapter. However, this option
    varies in its support and capability based on the actual software platform being
    used. Consult your software for details on how to accomplish this task with your
    environment.

    specific points that need to be considered in order to make the installation proceed
    properly. Fortunately, Kali keeps its installation requirements fairly simple,
    but there are definitely things that could impact your experience and make Kali
    operate in a less than stellar manner.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much memory is currently on the system? More memory makes for a better experience
    and better performing Kali system. On my own personal system, I run with 8 GB
    and Kali runs beautifully. If you run Kali off of something other than the hard
    drive, more memory may allow for better performance as more of Kali can be kept
    in memory.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What applications will you be running? If you will be installing additional
    applications into Kali, you may need to adjust your configuration to account for
    their inclusion. Some utilities require special hardware (such as wireless devices)
    to be present in order to function properly. If you rely on these functions or
    will use them in the future, ensure that all your hardware is compatible or can
    be upgraded.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What type of hard drive do you have? I have run Kali off of both traditional
    drives and SSD and, of the two, SSDs run much better and make for a more satisfying
    experience and performance.
  prefs:

    we now need to consider how it will be installed. It is likely that more than
    a fair share of you reading this book will have extensive experience in a Windows
    environment and, as such, you will have almost always installed an OS to a hard
    drive directly. However, as we just learned Kali, offers additional installation
    options. We now need to make a determination of which path we are going to take
    in regards to installation location.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Installing to a flash drive without persistence**: This is a suitable installation
    method if you wish to use Kali to perform forensics, as it will not alter the
    host and therefore not affect potential evidence on the system. It is also a very
    suitable installation method if you wish to have Kali assist you with network
    or host troubleshooting. It may also be ideal if you want to have a portable environment
    that you can run on any system without having to worry about changes to the host
    or to the flash drive itself.'

    is suitable for situations where you want to be able to carry Kali with you for
    troubleshooting, forensics or to have a portable pentesting kit, but you wish
    to be able to save files and make changes to the system without losing those changes
    every time you shut the system down.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it offers the best performance, since the files don''t need to be loaded into
    memory each boot. This installation also offers the ability to save files and
    make changes without losing either upon reboot. It is ideal if you want to have
    a system that retains changes, especially if you tend to tweak a system to your
    own needs.'

- en: If very specific hardware, such as high-powered graphics cards, will be used
    for cracking passwords, it is recommended that the installation of Kali Linux
    be installed on a desktop computer. If there is a need to carry the operating
    system from customer site to customer site, or there is a desire to test wireless
    devices, a laptop is recommended. The installation of the operating system is
    the same for laptop and desktop computers.
  prefs: []

- en: For me personally, I run Kali in both a virtual environment and on a dedicated
    laptop with Kali as the only OS installed. The system I chose is an older Lenovo
    laptop with a touchscreen, 2.4 GHz CPU, 8 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    and not much else in the way of bells and whistles. It is definitely not state
    of the art, but it has enough power and features behind it that I can do what
    I need with horsepower to spare.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My choice of laptop was based on a couple main issues namely hardware support
    and power. By choosing a slightly older system I didn't have to worry about Kali
    supporting the hardware, nor did I have to worry about having to look for solutions
    to make the system work, it just did. In regards to power, I am referring to the
    fact that Linux traditionally doesn't need the most powerful hardware to get good
    performance. In fact, Linux has traditionally been known to run on older hardware
    without the problems other operating systems would experience. However, I made
    sure I didn't go back so far that I would be constrained with the tools I need
    to use. I have found that hardware that has been manufactured in the last five
    years or less will generally be OK to run Kali in most cases.

- en: One of the areas you don't want to cut corners on when choosing a system for
    Kali is that of the hard drive. It is usually a good idea to get a drive that
    has at least 150 GB of space, but you should consider drives larger than this
    if possible, as you will undoubtedly install other tools that aren't included
    in Kali (not to mention the data you generate will take up space as well).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that, as a penetration tester, you will be not just asked, but
    required to keep your findings confidential and, for many tests, this means wiping
    the hard drive to be safe. While it is possible to clean an installed OS so it
    is returned to its base or original unaltered state, you still may want to wipe
    the drive. The suggestion would be to set up the system the way you desire then
    image it so you can effectively wipe a drive then restore your original image
    at will. Always keep in mind that losing control of or leaking information is
    something that will not only upset your client, but open you up to lawsuits, loss
    of reputation, loss of career, and bad karma. Basically, take the proper precautions
    with the data you have gathered both during and after a test.

- en: When I acquired my current Kali system, one of the first things I did was to
    replace the hard drive with a larger SSD drive. I feel that this investment is
    a good one for many reasons which I will try to explain here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, the use of an SSD drive will typically result in the reduction of battery
    drain on a system to some degree. This reduction in battery drain results in longer
    mobile use when you can't plug into a wall.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, SSD drives are faster than traditional hard drives by a substantial
    amount. SSD drives result in faster read and write times than a traditional hard
    drive. Being able to retrieve and manipulate data faster is a tremendous benefit
    for a penetration tester (or anyone for that matter).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, SSD drives can take a lot more of a beating than older traditional drives.
    The lack of a spinning disk inside the computer means that moving and transporting
    the drive plus system is a lot less likely to result in drive failure.

    as well as what types of tests you may be performing. Namely, what we are considering
    in this section is your choice of network interface, that is, wired or wireless.
    Wireless is a common inclusion on just about any class of device you will run
    into today (or those made in the last 10 years). On the other hand, wired network
    connections on devices have become less common with many notebooks and laptops
    dropping them altogether.

    network cards which are either included in your device or are added via other

    of a popular USB wireless network adapter:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Wi-Fi adapter is whether you will be running Kali NetHunter at some point. Kali
    NetHunter is discussed elsewhere in this book, but in a nutshell, it is an Android-based
    version of Kali for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. If your plan
    is to use this platform in your testing, you should make sure that the Wi-Fi adapter
    you purchase here is compatible with both forms of Kali so you don't have to purchase
    more adapters than you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other form of wireless you may perform some testing with is Bluetooth, in
    which case you probably will need to acquire an additional adapter for this purpose.
    The reason for purchasing another adapter is that fact that Bluetooth, by default,
    only extends out to 30 feet or 10 meters in range. If you need greater range to
    enable the scanning of a larger area you can acquire an Industrial Bluetooth adapter
    which extends scanning range to 1000' or more.

- en: After you have installed Kali Linux, it is not a bad idea to update the distribution
    to ensure you have the latest version of all the tools and to apply any patches
    and other fixes that may have been released. You should not only engage in applying
    updates to a system after you install it, but you should also do it on a regular
    basis for the same reasons. The reality is that updates and patches are released
    fairly regularly, so it is best to make it a habit of checking for these, so you
    don't miss anything or leave yourself insecure.
  prefs: []

- en: It is important to recognize that an update should always be run immediately
    after installation is completed as well as on a regular basis. This is for a number
    of reasons, mainly that new tools can get released or new updates to application
    databases may have been made since the image or ISO file have been posted on the
    website. Not to mention the fact that updating software regularly is a key factor
    in protecting yourself from security issues and concerns as they arise.

    which, in this case, are named `eth0` and `lo`. You can have names such as `eth1`
    or other labels in these places based on the network type. For our purposes, we
    should see an adapter labeled `wlan0` or `wlan1` or something starting with the
    `wlan` prefix indicating wireless. For the purposes of our analysis, we will use
    the `eth0` adapter; the lo adapter is the loopback virtual adapter and is not
    of use for us here.
  prefs: []

    you if the adapter is online or offline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second piece of important information is the line starting with the label
    `inet`. This line gives us information about the current configured IPv4 address
    and associated netmask and other details. The line directly under it is giving
    the same sort of information, but for IPv6.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    network adapter's **Media Access Control** (**MAC**) address, which is also known
    as the **physical address of the adapter**.

    be able to perform this type of testing effectively. While it's true that most
    devices, such as notebooks, tablets, desktops and other computing platforms, include
    Bluetooth support these all tend to be short range (on average 10 meters or 30
    feet) and do not support vital features, such as packet injection (which we will
    learn about later).

    the Sena UD100 and the Ubertooth One.

    injection and an external (replaceable) antenna. By default, the adapter supports
    a range of up to 1000 feet (meaning it can pick up devices to that limit or further
    with an antenna upgrade).

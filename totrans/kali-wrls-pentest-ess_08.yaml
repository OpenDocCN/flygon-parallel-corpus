    penetration testing. All these phases are equally important to achieve accurate
    and reliable results but need to be completed with the final phase, which is the
    reporting phase.

    test are gathered and described in a report to be submitted to the customer.

- en: The reporting phase is often underestimated in its importance and considered
    as the boring, though necessary, part of a penetration test. Of course, the discovery
    and attack phases are the core and most exciting parts as it is when the penetration
    tester's technical skills are applied in practice. Penetration testers could be
    very skilled and might do an excellent job, but if they somehow fail to communicate
    their achievements to the customer effectively, their job is (at least in part)
    in vain.

- en: 'In the first stage, report planning, we define the objectives, the target audience
    and the contents of the report, as well as the estimated time we are going to
    dedicate to writing it. Defining the objectives means explaining why the test
    has been conducted and the benefits that will derive from it, helping both the
    penetration tester and the customer to focus on the most important points. The
    target audience of the report is usually formed by both the management and the
    executives of the organization/company and the IT managers and staff, in particular
    the Information Security team, if present in the organization. Depending on the
    type of audience, the layout and the contents of the report can be divided in
    two main parts: the **executive summary** and the **technical report**. We will
    cover both later in the relative dedicated sections. Defining the audience also
    implies defining the classification and the distribution of the report. The classification
    of a document, generally speaking, establishes its level of confidentiality and
    therefore the people that are allowed to read it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The distribution is about how to deliver it to the right persons and in a secure
    manner. For example, if we have to send the report by e-mail, it would be advisable
    to send it within an encrypted message, using public encryption tools, such as
    GnuPGP. Indeed, a penetration testing report contains critical information that
    could be used to attack the network and the systems of the organization if it
    falls in the wrong hands!

    of network scanning and vulnerability assessment, the tools and the procedures
    used, and take meaningful screenshots of the implemented activities.

    file. For example, both airodump-ng and Kismet, used in the discovery phase, have
    options to save the outputs in the text readable formats, such as CSV and XML.

    by other penetration testers, or, eventually, by the customer IT staff itself.

    step is to write the first draft of the report. In this stage, we organize all
    the collected information in a structured way and we describe all the steps performed
    during the penetration test. The writing of the report should follow a format,
    as we will see later in this chapter. The first draft writing usually takes about
    60 percent of all the report writing time.

    and the colors for the headings and the text, the margins, the header and footer
    content, and so on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    version, the date, the service provider, and the organization names. The service
    provider is the penetration tester or the penetration testing team. In the latter
    case, it is good practice to include the names of all the team members.

    a table of contents to list all the sections of the report with the page numbers.

    of the customer organization, which is for a nontechnical audience.
  prefs: []

    and results of the penetration test, expressed in a clear language and should
    avoid the usage of technical jargon.

    focus on the outcomes and state to see whether the tested networks are secure
    or not; we should describe how the security, that is, the confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability of the information is affected by the issues found and what should
    be done to address them.

    adopted to conduct the tests, which could include, among others, the certifications
    owned by the penetration testers, the type of software used (commercial or open
    source) and how the risk rating of the vulnerabilities is calculated. For example,
    a free and open standard to assess the severity of a vulnerability is the **Common
    Vulnerability Scoring System** (**CVSS**).

    includes a comprehensive list of the detected networks and clients, a summary
    of the detected vulnerabilities grouped by severity, and a detailed description
    of each vulnerability.

    level and the risk associated and the likelihood (probability) to be exploited
    by an attacker. It is also important to describe the tools and the commands used
    to discover it.

    with open authentication, WEP or WPA weak keys and WPS enabled, honeypot and rogue
    access points.

    which is to expose the most critical vulnerabilities first, to better catch the
    customer's attention on the issues that must be solved urgently.

- en: When describing the findings of the penetration test, it could be appropriate
    to present the information with tables, graphs, and diagrams to give it a clearer
    and more immediate to read aspect. For example, it would be nice to include a
    graphical map of the wireless networks generated by giskismet, as we have seen
    in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. WLAN Reconnaissance"), *WLAN Reconnaissance*.

    where the authors cite external sources (publications, books, websites, and so
    on) that could be useful for the audience to better understand the contents of
    the report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reporting phase does not always terminate with the redaction of the report
    but also comprises presenting and explaining it to the customer. In fact, even
    the IT staff might not have the technical skills, background and/or expertise
    to fully understand the contents of the report, and therefore, might need some
    explanations by the penetration tester(s).

    the support of slides or animated presentations that could also be realized with

    assessment. Now that vulnerabilities have been found, you will actually validate
    and take advantage of these vulnerabilities by exploiting the system, in the hope
    of gaining full control or additional information and visibility into the targeted
    network and the systems therein. This chapter will highlight and discuss practices
    and tools that are used to conduct real-world exploitation.

    Hence, using publicly-available exploits and adjusting them to fit your target
    environment may require expertise, which would assist you in transforming the
    skeleton of one exploit into another, if the similarity and purpose is almost
    the same. We highly encourage the practice of publicly-available exploits in your
    own labs to further understand and kickstart writing your own exploit code.

- en: '**Reverse-engineering**: This is another broad area for discovering the vulnerabilities
    that could exist in an electronic device, software, or system by analyzing its
    functions, structures, and operations. The purpose is to deduce code from a given
    system without any prior knowledge of its internal working; to examine it for
    error conditions, poorly-designed functions, and protocols; and to test the boundary
    conditions. There are several reasons to use your reverse-engineering skills,
    such as the removal of copyright protection from a software, security auditing,
    competitive technical intelligence, identification of patent infringement, interoperability,
    understanding the product workflow, and acquiring sensitive data. Reverse-engineering
    adds two layers of concept to examining the code of an application: source-code
    auditing and binary auditing. If you have access to the application source code,
    you can accomplish the security analysis through automated tools; or manually
    study the source in order to extract the conditions where a vulnerability can
    be triggered. On the other hand, binary auditing simplifies the task of reverse-engineering
    where the application exists without any source code. Disassemblers and decompilers
    are two generic types of tools that may assist the auditor with binary analysis.
    Disassemblers generate the assembly code from a complied binary program, while
    decompilers generate a high-level language code from a compiled binary program.
    However, dealing with either of these tools is quite challenging and requires
    a careful assessment.'

    access to your target operating system. Thus, we will demonstrate a few scenarios

- en: For many years, a number of vulnerabilities have been reported in the public
    domain. Some of these were disclosed with the PoC exploit code to prove the feasibility
    and viability of a vulnerability found in the specific software or application.
    Many still remain unaddressed. This competitive era of finding publicly-available
    exploits and vulnerability information makes it easier for penetration testers
    to quickly search and retrieve the best-available exploit that may suit their
    target system environment. You can also port one type of exploit to another type
    (for example, Win32 architecture to Linux architecture) provided that you hold
    intermediate programming skills, and a clear understanding of OS-specific architecture.
    We have provided a combined set of online repositories that may help you to track
    down any vulnerability information, or its exploit, by searching through them.
  prefs: []

    provide detailed vulnerability information. For this reason, consulting more than

- en: A bind shell is a remote shell connection that provides access to the target
    system on the successful exploitation and execution of shellcode by setting up
    a bind port listener. This opens a gateway for an attacker to connect back to
    the compromised machine on the bind shell port using a tool such as Netcat, which
    could tunnel the standard input (`stdin`) and output (`stdout`) over a TCP connection.
    This scenario works in a similar way to that of a Telnet client establishing a
    connection to a Telnet server, and is applicable in an environment where the attacker
    is behind the **Network Address Translation** (**NAT**) or firewall and direct
    contact from the compromised host to the attacker IP is not possible.

    can come in handy in situations where you write your own exploit with a bind shellcode,
    which should require a third-party handler to establish a connection to the compromised
    host. You can read some practical examples of Netcat usage for various network-security
    operations at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat).

    a port on the target system and waiting for the connection from the attacker's
    machine, it simply connects back to the attacker's IP and port, and spawns a shell.
    A visible dimension of the reverse shell is to consider a target behind the NAT
    or firewall that prevents public access to its system resources.

    is a single self-contained shellcode that is to be executed with one instance
    of an exploit, while the stager payload creates a communication channel between
    the attacker and victim machine to read off the rest of the staging shellcode
    in order to perform a specific task. It is common practice to choose stager payloads
    because they are much smaller than inline payloads.

    command (for example, route add `10.2.4.0 255.255.255.0 1`). Here, the `SessionId`
    parameter points to the existing meterpreter session (gateway), and the `targetsubnet`
    parameter is another network address (or dual-homed Ethernet network address)
    that resides beyond our compromised target. Once you set Metasploit to route all
    of the traffic through a compromised host session, we are ready to penetrate further

    penetration testing while connected to a wired network. This included both internal
    **Local Area Networking** (**LAN**) and techniques such as web application assessments
    over the public internet. One area of focus that deserves attention is wireless
    networking. Wireless networks are ubiquitous, having been deployed in a variety
    of environments, such as commercial, government, educational, and residential
    environments. As a result, penetration testers should ensure that these networks
    have the appropriate amount of security controls and are free from configuration
    errors.

    frequencies to transmit data between the access point and the connected networks.

    This set of rules was first developed for ease of use and the ability to rapidly
    connect devices. Concerns about security were not addressed in the initial standards
    that were published in 1997\. Since then, the standards have had a number of amendments;
    the first of these with significant impact on wireless networking was 802.11b.
    This was the most widely accepted standard and was released in 1999.

    to be developed in conjunction with the 802.11 standards. First deployed in 1999
    alongside the first widely adopted iteration of 802.11, WEP was designed to provide
    the same amount of security that was found on wired networks. This was accomplished
    using a combination of RC4 ciphers to provide confidentiality and the use of the
    CRC32 for integrity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authenticating to a WEP network is done through the use of either a 64- or 128-bit
    key. The 64-bit key is derived by entering a series of 10 hexadecimal characters.
    These initial 40 bits are combined with a 24-bit **Initialization Vector** (**IV**),
    which forms the RC4 encryption key. For the 128-bit key, a 104-bit key or 26 hexadecimal
    characters are combined with the 24-bit IV to create the RC4 key.

- en: As was addressed previously, WEP was not designed with message confidentiality
    and integrity as a central focus. As a result, there are two key vulnerabilities
    with WEP implementations. First, the CRC32 algorithm is not used for encryption
    per se, but rather as a checksum against errors. The second is that the RC4 is
    susceptible to what is known as an Initialization Vector attack. The IV attack
    is possible due to the fact that the RC4 cipher is a stream cipher and, as a result,
    the same key should never be used twice. The 24-bit key is too short on a busy
    wireless network to be of use. In about 50% of cases, the same IV will be used
    in a wireless communication channel within 5,000 uses. This will cause a collision,
    whereby the IV and the entire WEP key can be reversed.
  prefs: []

    of more secure wireless implementations. As a result, there is a good chance that
    you may not see one implemented in the wild, but there are access points sold
    on the commercial market to this day that still have WEP enabled. Also, you may
    encounter legacy networks that still use this protocol.

    on wireless networks that we can explore. One such issue is bypassing a common
    wireless control called MAC filtering. MAC filtering is a control on some routers
    whereby only specific MAC addresses or MAC types are allowed. For example, you
    may be testing a commercial location that utilizes iPads. The wireless network
    is only going to allow MAC addresses with the first three hex characters of `34:12:98`.
    Other organizations may have a set list of MAC addresses that are allowed to join.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are able to compromise the WPA key but find that you are unable to join
    the network, the target organization may be utilizing some form of MAC address
    filtering. To bypass this, we will use the Macchanger command-line tool. This
    simple command allows us to change our MAC address to something that will allow
    us to connect. First, you can easily find a new MAC address from previous reconnaissance
    and cracking attempts. The Airodump-ng tool will identify clients that are connected
    to wireless networks. Furthermore, parsing through capture files with Wireshark
    will allow you to identify potentially valid MAC addresses.

    wireless router. Most wireless routers have either a web-based, or other console
    in which legitimate administrators are able to log in and manage the router. Usually,
    these routers are located at the beginning of the subnet of the wireless LAN we
    connect to. For example, if we connect to `Wifi_Crack` and run the `ifconfig wlan0` command,
    it identifies us as having the IP address of `10.0.0.7`.

    true. Almost any Windows system can be hardened to the point that it takes too
    long to exploit its vulnerabilities. In this chapter, you will learn how to footprint
    your Windows network and discover the vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

    tool in any good penetration tester's toolbox is your **mindset**. You have to
    have the mind of a sniper. You learn your target's habits and its actions. You
    learn the traffic flows on the network where your target lives. You find the weaknesses
    in your target and then attack those weaknesses. Search and destroy!

    of time. It takes almost as long as pinging UDP ports on the target machines.
    For either case, each machine will take approximately 75 seconds per port. In
    the first case, that means a ping of six machines takes 450 seconds just to fail
    the ping test. UDP searches test many more ports per machine. At 1,000 ports tested
    per standard UDP-port scan, you are going to take about 21 hours per machine just
    to test UDP. If you don't have a really good reason to check UDP ports with Nmap,

    on a small network, and I mean a lot! So when pen-testing, you need the ability
    to gather your incoming data as you are carrying out the test. Kali comes with
    several applications for this. Whichever one you choose, just choose one and use
    it. Six weeks after the test is run, and you need to go back and verify something,
    you'll be happy you did. Also, when testing in a high-security environment, such
    as a network that must be either HIPPA- or PCI-compliant, these notes are particularly
    useful when building your report. Also, make sure you keep all your project files
    in one directory along with this framework. Another reason to take good notes
    is that, if legal actions arise, your notes could be your best defense.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The following screenshot shows the framework Bo uses. He makes a folder for
    the client organization, and then a folder for the actual test with the date in
    the folder name. It is safe to assume that, wherever you ply your trade, you will
    see the same clients over and over. If you are not seeing repeat business, something
    is wrong with your own business model. Ext-20150315 translates to an external
    test conducted on 20150315\. 20150315 is a Unix-style date that breaks down to
    YYYYMMDD. If you see Unix-style datestamps that look like 20150317213209, then
    this can be broken down to the second. Inside of that folder, Bo sets up directories
    for evidence, notes, and scans-docs. All evidence collected, including screenshots,
    is dropped into the `evidence` folder. Notes from KeepNote are kept in the `notes`
    folder, and scans and other related documents are kept in the `scans-docs` folder.
    When we start conducting tests later in this book, you will see this framework
    being used.

    this will help you to keep track of your testing.

- en: Bo's favorite is KeepNote. You saw an introduction to KeepNote in [Chapter 1](b18fe074-058f-410f-86de-77499a727708.xhtml),
    *Choosing Your Distro*. KeepNote is a simple note-taking application. As Bo tests,
    he keeps copies of outputs from manual exploits, individual scan data, and screenshots.
    What makes this nice is that you have the ability to format your data as you go,
    so importing it into a template later is just a matter of copy/paste.

    its GUI interface, Zenmap. We learned about the detailed use of OpenVAS Vulnerability
    Scanner, and the use of this data in your attack. We also learned about the use

    underlying the way networks work involves an expectation of trustworthiness. What
    happens when a malefactor decides to play tricks with the way network packets
    are put together? This is spoofing. For example, when an ICMP packet is broadcast
    to a large number of hosts, but the origin IP address has been forged to point
    to a specific target host, all the hosts sent the broadcast packet send an unexpected
    acknowledgement to the victim. This is a *Smurf Attack*, and it ties up the victim
    machine. The Smurf Attack is one of many denial of service attacks.'

    the more you are able to hear*. This is the heart of sniffing network traffic.
    You quietly listen to the network traffic, copying every packet on the wire. Every
    packet is important or it wouldn''t be there. Think about that for a moment with
    your security hat on. Do you understand why sending passwords in clear text is
    so bad? Well, protocols such as Telnet, FTP, and HTTP send passwords in clear
    text, instead of an encrypted hash. Any packet sniffer will catch these passwords
    and it doesn''t take a genius to launch a search of the packet capture for terms
    such as password. There''s no need to crack a hash; it is just there. You can
    impress a manager or a client by just pulling their clear-text password out of
    thin air. The bad guys use the same technique to break into networks and steal
    money and secrets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More than just passwords can be found within your copied packets. Packet sniffers
    are not only useful for purposes. They can be useful when looking for an attacker
    on the network. You can't hide from a packet sniffer. Packet sniffers are also
    great for network diagnostics. For instance, a sluggish network could be caused
    by a server with a dying NIC that is talking away to no one, or a run-away process
    tying up many others with responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If sniffing is listening to the network then spoofing is lying on the network.
    What you are doing is having the attacking machine lie to the network and pretend
    to be someone else. With some of the tools described next and with two network
    cards on the attacking machine on the network, you can even pass the traffic onto
    the real host and capture all traffic to and from both machines. This is a **Man-in-the
    Middle** (**MitM**) attack. In most cases of pentesting, you are really only after
    the password hashes that can be obtained without a full MitM attack. Just spoofing
    without passing the traffic on will reveal password hashes in the ARP broadcasts
    from NetBIOS.

    which can be found at [http://www.microolap.com/products/network/tcpdump/](http://www.microolap.com/products/network/tcpdump/).
    It's not free, but there is a trial version. The nice thing about this version
    is that it is one simple executable which can be uploaded to a system and used
    without installing extra drivers. It can be launched on a cracked system to which
    you have shell access. Your shell must have system or administrator level access
    to work, because NICs will not run in promiscuous mode without administrative
    privileges. Another packet dump tool is **Windump.exe**, available from [http://www.winpcap.org/windump/install/](http://www.winpcap.org/windump/install/),
    where you will also find **WinPcap.exe**, which you need on the machine to run
    tcpdump or WinDump.

    about servers and devices transmitting data across a network. Everyone is right
    in their answer but still really miss exactly what it is. The internet is packets.
    Without packets, the information goes nowhere. Most don't realize that TCP/IP
    is two different protocol suites that work independently of each other. There
    is IP and then there is TCP and UDP, which run on top of IP. Then all this runs
    on top of internet frames.

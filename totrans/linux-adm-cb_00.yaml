- en: When it comes to servers, there's no more popular OS than Linux and its family
    of distributions. No matter which company you work for these days, there's a good
    chance at least part of their infrastructure runs some flavor of Linux.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of this, there's never been a better time to get into Linux system administration
    and engineering (along with the tangentially related disciplines), though I would
    say that, of course... being a Linux sysadmin.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book aims to be your reference and guide for certain common tasks in the
    Linux world, from the mundane and basic to the fun and complex, though anything
    can be complex if you try hard enough. I hope that, while reading it, you find
    something new (preferably a lot of new things) and maybe come across suggestions
    that you wouldn't have come across otherwise.

    the easiest way to do so is by utilizing Vagrant, which is software for building

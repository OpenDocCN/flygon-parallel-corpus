- en: NMIs are enough to cover the whole exception list. Back to maskable interrupts,
    their number depends on the number of devices connected, and how they actually
    share those IRQ lines. Sometimes, they are not enough and some of them need multiplexing.
    The commonly used method is by means of a GPIO controller, which also acts as
    an interrupt controller. In this chapter, we will deal with the API that the kernel
    offers to manage IRQ and the ways by which multiplexing can be done, and get deeper
    in interrupt controller driver writing.

    , function with which drivers requesting an IRQ know whether the handler will
    run in a thread context or not, and call `request_threaded_irq()` or `request_irq()`
    accordingly. It means that whether the IRQ associated to our device comes from
    an interrupt controller that may not sleep (memory mapped one) or from one that
    can sleep (behind I2C/SPI bus), there will be no need to change the code. Its

    words, it selects either a hardIRQ or threaded handling method depending on the

    is that, one does not need to care about what can be done in the IRQ handler,
    as the context in which the handler will run depends on the interrupt controller
    that provides the IRQ line. In our example, if the GPIO below to a controller
    seating on an I2C or SPI bus, the handler will be threaded. Otherwise, the handler
    will run in hardirq.

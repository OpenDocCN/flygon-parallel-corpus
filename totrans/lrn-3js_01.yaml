    directly from JavaScript. You can easily add video and audio with the new HTML5
    tags and create interactive components through the use of the HTML5 canvas. Together
    with HTML5, modern browsers also started supporting WebGL. With WebGL, you can
    directly make use of the processing resources of your graphics card and create
    high-performance 2D and 3D computer graphics. Programming WebGL directly from
    JavaScript to create and animate 3D scenes is a very complex and error-prone process.
    Three.js is a library that makes this a lot easier. The following list shows some
    of the things that Three.js makes easy:'

    There is, however, also a CSS 3D-based renderer, which provides an easy API to
    create CSS 3D-based 3D scenes. A big advantage of using a CSS 3D-based approach
    is that this standard is supported on almost all mobile and desktop browsers and
    allows you to render HTML elements in a 3D space. We'll show how to use the CSS

    a local web server. This first approach will work for most of the basic examples,
    but when we start loading external resources, such as models or texture images,
    just opening the HTML file isn't enough. In this case, we need a local web server
    to make sure the external resources are loaded correctly. In the following section,
    we explain a couple of different ways you can set up a simple local web server
    for testing. If you can't set up a local web server but use Chrome or Firefox,

    Three.js Scene"), *Basic Components That Make Up a Three.js Scene*, you learn
    more about the arguments you can pass in to the `camera` object. Next we define
    `renderer`. The `renderer` object is responsible for calculating what the `scene`
    object will look like in the browser based on the `camera` object's angle. We
    create `WebGLRenderer` that uses your graphics card to render the scene in this
    example.

    you can find at [http://threejs.org/](http://threejs.org/)), you'll notice that
    there are different renderers available besides the WebGL-based one. There is
    a canvas-based renderer and even an SVG-based one. Even though they work and can
    render simple scenes, I wouldn't recommend using them. They're very CPU-intensive
    and lack features such as good material support and shadows.

  prefs: []

- en: As you can see, we create an `axes` object and use the `scene.add` function
    to add these axes to our scene. Next, we create the plane. This is done in two
    steps. First, we define what the plane looks like using the new `THREE.PlaneGeometry(60,20)`
    code. In this case, it has a width of `60` and a height of `20`. We also need
    to tell Three.js what this plane looks like (for example, its color and its transparency).
    In Three.js, we do this by creating a material object. For this first example,
    we'll create a basic material (`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`) with the color `0xcccccc`.
    Next, we combine these two into a `Mesh` object with the name `plane`. Before
    we add `plane` to the scene, we need to put it in the correct position; we do
    this by first rotating it 90 degrees around the x axis, and next, we define its
    position in the scene using the position properties. If you're already interested
    in the details of this, look at the `06-mesh-properties.html` example from the
    code folder of [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Basic Components That Make Up
    a Three.js Scene"), *Basic Components That Make Up a Three.js Scene*, which shows
    and explains rotation and positioning. We then need to do is add `plane` to `scene`,
    just like we did with `axes`.

    and `z` position attributes to hover above our scene. To make sure the camera
    is looking at our objects, we use the `lookAt` function to point it at the center
    of our scene, which is located at position (0, 0, 0) by default. All that is left
    to do is append the output from the renderer to the `<div>` element of our HTML
    skeleton. We use standard JavaScript to select the correct output element and
    append it to our `div` element with the `appendChild` function. Finally, we tell
    `renderer` to render `scene` using the `camera` object provided.

    differently to light. The basic material we used in the previous example (`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`)

    function. With `setInterval`, we could specify a function that, for instance,
    would be called every 100 milliseconds. The problem with this function is that
    it doesn't take into account what is happening in the browser. If you were browsing
    another tab, this function would still be fired every couple of milliseconds.

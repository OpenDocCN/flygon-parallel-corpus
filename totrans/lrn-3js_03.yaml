    previous chapter, we looked a bit deeper at the most important parts of the scene:
    the geometries, meshes, and cameras. You might have noticed that we skipped lights
    in that chapter even though they make up an important part of every Three.js scene.
    Without lights, we won''t see anything rendered. Since Three.js contains a large
    number of lights, each of which has a specific use, we''ll use this whole chapter
    to explain the various details of the lights and prepare you for the next chapter

- en: When you create `THREE.AmbientLight`, the color is applied globally. There isn't
    a specific direction this light comes from, and `THREE.AmbientLight` doesn't contribute
    to any shadows. You would normally not use `THREE.AmbientLight` as the single
    source of light in a scene since it colors all the objects in the same color,
    regardless of shape. You use it together with other lighting sources, such as
    `THREE.SpotLight` or `THREE.DirectionalLight` to soften the shadows or add some
    additional color to the scene. The easiest way to understand this is by looking
    at the `01-ambient-light.html` example in the `chapter-03` folder. With this example,
    you get a simple user interface that can be used to modify `THREE.AmbientLight`
    that is available in this scene. Note that in this scene, we also have `THREE.SpotLight`,
    which adds additional lighting and provides shadows.

    `THREE.AmbientLight` doesn''t have a position and is applied globally, so we only
    need to specify the color (in hex), `new THREE.AmbientLight(ambiColor)`, and add
    this light to the scene, `scene.add(ambientLight)`. In the example, we bind the
    color of `THREE.AmbientLight` to the control menu. To do this, you can use the
    same kind of configuration we used in the previous two chapters. The only change
    is that instead of using the `gui.add(...)` function, we use the `gui.addColor(...)`
    function. This creates an option in the control menu, with which we can directly
    change the color of the passed-in variable. In the code, you can see that we use
    the `onChange` feature of dat.GUI: `gui.addColor(...).onChange(function(e){...})`.
    With this function, we tell `dat.GUI` to call the passed-in function each time
    the color changes. In this specific case, we set the color of `THREE.AmbientLight`

    that should cast shadows, and that we cast the `receiveShadow` property, for objects

    lights that are available in Three.js. In this chapter, you learned that configuring
    lights, colors, and shadows is not an exact science. To get to the correct result,
    you should experiment with the different settings and use a dat.GUI control to
    fine-tune your configuration. The different lights behave in different manners.
    A `THREE.AmbientLight` color is added to each and every color in the scene and
    is often used to smooth hard colors and shadows. `THREE.PointLight` emits light
    in all directions but can't be used to create shadows. `THREE.SpotLight` is a
    light that resembles a flashlight. It has a conical shape, can be configured to
    fade over distance, and is able to cast shadows. We also looked at `THREE.DirectionalLight`.
    This light can be compared with a faraway light, such as the sun, whose light
    rays travel parallel to each other, the intensity of which doesn't decrease the
    farther away it gets from the configured target. Besides the standard lights,
    we also looked at a couple of more specialized lights. For a more natural outdoor
    effect, you can use `THREE.HemisphereLight`, which takes into account ground and
    sky reflections; `THREE.AreaLight` doesn't shine from a single point, but emits
    light from a large area. We showed you how to add a photographic lens flare with

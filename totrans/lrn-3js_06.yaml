    a material, you shouldn't use `THREE.TextGeometry`. `THREE.TextGeometry`, which
    internally uses `THREE.ExtrudeGeometry` to build the 3D text, and the JavaScript
    fonts introduce a lot of overhead. Rendering a simple 2D font is better than just
    using the HTML5 canvas. With `context.font`, you can set the font to be used,
    and with `context.fillText`, you can output text to the canvas. You can then use
    this canvas as input for your texture. We will show you how to do this in [Chapter
    10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Loading and Working with Textures"), *Loading and Working
    with Textures*.

    These fonts are based on the fonts provided by **typeface.js** ([http://typeface.neocracy.org:81/](http://typeface.neocracy.org:81/)).
    Typeface.js is a library that can convert TrueType and OpenType fonts to JavaScript.
    The resulting JavaScript file can be included in your page, and the font can then
    be used in Three.js.

    On this page, you can upload a font, and it will be converted to JavaScript for
    you. Note that this doesn't work for all types of fonts. The simpler the font
    (more straight lines), the better the chance is that it will be rendered correctly
    when used in Three.js.

    we want on the `ThreeBSP` object wrapped around the center sphere (`sphere1BSP`),
    and the result from this function will contain all the information we need to
    create a new mesh. To create this mesh, we just call the `toMesh()` function on
    the `sphere1BSP` object. On the resulting object, we have to make sure that all
    the normals are computed correctly by first calling `computeFaceNormals` and then
    calling `computeVertexNormals()`. These compute functions need to be called since
    by running one of the binary operations, the vertices and faces of the geometry
    are changed and this affects the normals of the faces. Explicitly recalculating
    them will make sure your new object is shaded smoothly (when shading on the material
    has been set to `THREE.SmoothShading`) and rendered correctly. Finally, we add
    the result to the scene.

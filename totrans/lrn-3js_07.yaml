    and APIs that Three.js has to offer. In this chapter, we''ll look into the only
    concept we''ve skipped until now: particles. With particles (sometimes also called
    sprites), it is very easy to create many small objects that you can use to simulate
    rain, snow, smoke, and other interesting effects. For instance, you can render
    individual geometries as a set of particles and control these particles separately.
    In this chapter, we''ll explore the various particle features provided by Three.js.
    To be more specific, we''ll look at the following subjects in this chapter:'

    we get started, though, a quick note on some of the names used in this chapter.
    In recent versions of Three.js, the names of the objects related to particles
    have changed. `THREE.PointCloud`, which we use in this chapter, used to be called
    `THREE.ParticleSystem`, `THREE.Sprite` used to be called `THREE.Particle`, and
    also the materials have undergone some name changes. So, if you see online examples
    using these old names, remember that they are talking about the same concepts.
    In this chapter, we use the new naming convention introduced in the latest versions
    of Three.js.

    the `THREE.Sprite` object. A `THREE.Sprite` object extends from the `THREE.Object3D`
    object just as `THREE.Mesh` does. This means that most of the properties and functions
    you know from `THREE.Mesh` can be used on `THREE.Sprite`. You can set its position
    using the `position` attribute, scale it using the `scale` property, and move
    it relatively using the `translate` properties.

    around the scene. This works great when you're working with a small number of
    objects, but you'll quickly run into performance issues when you want to work
    with a high number of `THREE.Sprite` objects because each of the objects needs
    to be managed separately by Three.js. Three.js provides an alternative way of
    handling a large number of sprites (or particles) using `THREE.PointCloud`. With
    `THREE.PointCloud`, Three.js doesn't have to manage many individual `THREE.Sprite`
    objects, but only the `THREE.PointCloud` instance.

    The constructor of `THREE.PointCloud` takes two properties: a geometry and a material.
    The material is used to color and texture the particles (as we''ll see later on),
    and the geometry defines where the individual particles are positioned. Each vertex
    and each point used to define the geometry is shown as a particle. When we create
    `THREE.PointCloud` based on `THREE.BoxGeometry`, we get 8 particles, one for each
    corner of the cube. Normally, though, you won''t create `THREE.PointCloud` from
    one of the standard Three.js geometries, but add the vertices manually to a geometry
    created from scratch (or use an externally loaded model) just like we did at the
    end of the previous section. In this section, we''ll dive a bit deeper into this
    approach and look at how you can use `THREE.PointCloudMaterial` to style the particles.

    this function, you can also see that we set the `sortParticles` property of `THREE.PointCloud`
    to `true`. This property makes sure that before the particles are rendered, they
    are sorted according to their *z* position on screen. If you see partly overlapping
    particles or incorrect transparency, setting this property to `true` will (in
    most cases) fix that. You should note, though, that setting this property to `true`
    will affect the performance of your scene. When this is set to true, Three.js
    will have to determine the distance to the camera for each individual particle.
    For a `THREE.PointCloud` object that is very large, this can have a big impact
    on performance.

    With `THREE.Sprite`, you have more control over the individual particle, but it

    approach, however, is a bit limited. The more different textures we want, the
    more point clouds we'll have to create and manage. If you have a limited set of
    particles with different styles, you'd better use the `THREE.Sprite` object we
    showed at the beginning of this chapter.

    single particles with `THREE.CanvasRenderer` and `THREE.WebGLRenderer`. These
    sprites were positioned somewhere in the 3D world, and their size was based on
    the distance from the camera (this is also sometimes called **billboarding**).
    In this section, we'll show an alternative use of the `THREE.Sprite` object. We'll
    show you how you can use `THREE.Sprite` to create a layer similar to **head-up
    display** (**HUD**) for your 3D content using an extra `THREE.OrthographicCamera`
    instance. We will also show you how to select the image for a `THREE.Sprite` object
    using a sprite map.

    sprite to show on screen. With the `map.offset` property, we determine the offset
    for the *x* axis (u) and the *y* axis (v) for the texture we loaded. The scale
    for these properties runs from 0 to 1\. In our example, if we want to select the
    third ghost, we set the u-offset (*x* axis) to 0.4, and, because we've only got
    one row, we don't need to change the v-offset (*y* axis). If we only set this
    property, the texture shows the third, fourth, and fifth ghosts compressed together
    on screen. To only show one ghost, we need to zoom in. We do this by setting the
    `map.repeat` property for the u-value to 1/5\. This means that we zoom in (only
    for the *x* axis) to only show 20 percent of the texture, which is exactly one
    ghost.

    from the supplied geometry. This means that if we provide a complex geometry (for
    example, a torus knot or a tube), we can create `THREE.PointCloud` based on the
    vertices from that specific geometry. For this last section of this chapter, we'll
    create a torus knot, like the one we saw in the previous chapter, and render it

    particle systems are and how you can style these objects with the available materials.
    In this chapter, you saw how you can use `THREE.Sprite` directly with `THREE.CanvasRenderer`
    and `THREE.WebGLRenderer`. If you want to create a large number of particles,
    however, you should use `THREE.PointCloud`. With `THREE.PointCloud`, all the particles
    share the same material, and the only property you can change for an individual
    particle is their color by setting the `vertexColors` property of the material
    to `THREE.VertexColors` and providing a color value in the `colors` array of `THREE.Geometry`
    used to create `THREE.PointCloud`. We also showed how you can easily animate particles
    by changing their position. This works the same for an individual `THREE.Sprite`
    instance and the vertices from the geometry used to create `THREE.PointCloud`.

    a 3D modeling application such as Blender or 3D Studio Max. In the next chapter,
    you'll learn how you can load and display models created by such 3D modeling applications.

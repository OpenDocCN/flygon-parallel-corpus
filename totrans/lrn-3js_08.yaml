- en: In some of the previous chapters, you already saw this when working with multiple
    materials. When you create a mesh from a geometry using multiple materials, Three.js
    creates a group. Multiple copies of your geometry are added to this group, each
    with their own specific material. This group is returned, so it looks like a mesh
    that uses multiple materials. In truth, however, it is a group that contains a
    number of meshes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Creating groups is very easy. Every mesh you create can contain child elements,
    which can be added using the add function. The effect of adding a child object
    to a group is that you can move, scale, rotate, and translate the parent object,
    and all the child objects will also be affected. Let''s look at an example (`01-grouping.html`).
    The following screenshot shows this example:'

    If you check the **rotate** option, you''ll see these two meshes rotating around
    their center. This isn''t anything new and is not very exciting. However, these
    two objects haven''t been added to the scene directly, but have been added as
    a group. The following code encapsulates this discussion:'

- en: In this code snippet, you can see that we create `THREE.Object3D`. This is the
    base class of `THREE.Mesh` and `THREE.Scene`, but by itself, it doesn't contain
    anything or cause anything to be rendered. Note that in the latest version of
    Three.js, a new object called `THREE.Group` was introduced to support grouping.
    This object is exactly the same as a `THREE.Object3D` object, and you can replace
    `new THREE.Object3D()` in the previous code with `new THREE.Group()` for the same
    effect. In this example, we use the `add` function to add the `sphere` and `cube`
    to this object, and then we add it to the `scene`. If you look at the example,
    you can still move the cube and sphere around and scale and rotate these two objects.
    You can also do these things on the group they are in. If you look at the group
    menu, you'll see position and scale options. You can use these to scale and move
    the entire group around. The scale and position of the objects inside this group
    are relative to the scale and position of the group itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Scale and position are very straightforward. One thing to keep in mind, though,
    is that when you rotate a group, it doesn''t rotate the objects inside it separately;
    it rotates the entire group around its own center (in our example, you rotate
    the entire group around the center of the `group` object). In this example, we
    placed an arrow using the `THREE.ArrowHelper` object at the center of the group
    to indicate the rotation point:'

    geometries. The only thing you need to remember is that all positions, rotations,

    up with a single `THREE.Geometry` object.

    number of meshes. When you''re dealing with a very large number of objects, however,
    performance will become an issue. With groups, you''re still working with individual
    objects that each need to be handled and rendered separately. With `THREE.Geometry.merge()`,
    you can merge geometries together and create a combined one. In the following
    example, you can see how this works and the effect it has on performance. If you
    open the `02-merging.html` example, you see a scene with a set of randomly distributed
    semitransparent cubes. With the slider in the menu, you can set the number of
    cubes you want in the scene and redraw the scene by clicking on the **redraw**
    button. Depending on the hardware you''re running on, you''ll see a performance
    degradation as the number of cubes increases. In our case, as you can see in the
    following screenshot, this happens at around 4,000 objects, where the refresh
    rate drops to around 40 fps instead of the normal 60 fps:'

    meshes. With `THREE.Geometry.merge()`, you can solve this problem. Before we look
    at the code, let''s run this same example, but this time, with the **combine**

    also merge `THREE.Mesh` objects into `THREE.Geometry` objects. With the latest
    version, this functionality has been deprecated in favor of the `THREE.Geometry.merge`
    function. To make sure the merged-in `THREE.Geometry` object is positioned and
    rotated correctly, we not only provide `THREE.Geometry` to the `merge` function,
    but also its transformation matrix. When we add this matrix to the `merge` function,
    the cube we merge in will be positioned correctly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We do this 20,000 times and are left with a single geometry that we add to the
    scene. If you look at the code, you can probably see a couple of drawbacks of
    this approach. Since you're left with a single geometry, you can't apply a material
    to each individual cube. This, however, can be somewhat solved using `THREE.MeshFaceMaterial`.
    The biggest drawback, however, is that you lose control over the individual cubes.
    If you want to move, rotate, or scale a single cube, you can't (unless you search
    for the correct faces and vertices and position them individually).

    be found (relative to the page). This callback takes two parameters: `geometry`
    and `mat`. The `geometry` parameter contains the model, and the `mat` parameter

    the console to understand how the loaded object is built up. Often with these
    loaders, the geometry or mesh is returned as a hierarchy of groups. Understanding
    this makes it much easier to place and apply the correct material and take any
    other additional steps. Also, look at the position of a couple of vertices to
    determine whether you need to scale the model up or down and where to position
    the camera. In this example, we've also made the calls to `computeFaceNormals`
    and `computeVertexNormals`. This is required to ensure that the material used
    (`THREE.MeshLambertMaterial`) is rendered correctly.

    note on this specific example—when I loaded this model for the first time, the
    materials didn't render correctly. The reason was that the textures used the `.tga`
    format, which isn't supported in WebGL. To fix this, I had to convert the `.tga`

- en: Using models from external sources isn't that hard to do in Three.js. Especially
    for simple models, you only have to take a few simple steps. When working with
    external models, or creating them using grouping and merging, it is good to keep
    a couple of things in mind. The first thing you need to remember is that when
    you group objects, they still remain available as individual objects. Transformations
    applied to the parent also affect the children, but you can still transform the
    children individually. Besides grouping, you can also merge geometries together.
    With this approach, you lose the individual geometries and get a single new geometry.
    This is especially useful when you're dealing with thousands of geometries you
    need to render and you're running into performance issues.

- en: Three.js supports a large number of external formats. When using these format
    loaders, it's a good idea to look through the source code and log out the information
    received in the callback. This will help you to understand the steps you need
    to take to get the correct mesh and set it to the correct position and scale.
    Often, when the model doesn't show correctly, this is caused by its material settings.
    It could be that incompatible texture formats are used, opacity is incorrectly
    defined, or the format contains incorrect links to the texture images. It is usually
    a good idea to use a test material to determine whether the model itself is loaded
    correctly and log the loaded material to the JavaScript console to check for unexpected
    values. It is also possible to export meshes and scenes, but remember that `GeometryExporter`,
    `SceneExporter`, and `SceneLoader` of Three.js are still work in progress.

    basic rendering loop, and in the chapter following that, we used that to rotate
    some simple objects and show a couple of other basic animation concepts. In this
    chapter, we''re going to look in more detail at how animation is supported by
    Three.js. We will look in detail at the following four subjects:'

    [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Creating Your First 3D Scene with Three.js"),
    *Creating Your First 3D Scene with Three.js*, on the render loop. To support animations,
    we need to tell Three.js to render the scene every so often. For this, we use
    the standard HTML5 `requestAnimationFrame` functionality, as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: With this code, we only need to call the `render()` function once when were
    done initializing the scene. In the `render()` function itself, we use `requestAnimationFrame`
    to schedule the next rendering. This way, the browser will make sure the `render()`
    function is called at the correct interval (usually around 60 times a second).
    Before `requestAnimationFrame` was added to browsers, `setInterval(function, interval)`
    or `setTimeout(function, interval)` were used. These would call the specified
    function once every set interval. The problem with this approach is that it doesn't
    take into account what else is going on. Even if your animation isn't shown or
    is in a hidden tab, it is still called and is still using resources. Another issue
    is that these functions update the screen whenever they are called, not when it
    is the best time for the browser, which means higher CPU usage. With `requestAnimationFrame`,
    we don't tell the browser when it needs to update the screen; we ask the browser
    to run the supplied function when it's most opportune. Usually, this results in
    a frame rate of about 60 fps. With `requestAnimationFrame`, your animations will
    run more smoothly and will be more CPU- and GPU-friendly, and you don't have to
    worry about timing issues yourself.

    and that you can use to easily define the transition of a property between two
    values. All the intermediate points between the start and end values are calculated
    for you. This process is called **tweening**.

    the *x* property is changed from 10 to 3 over a period of 10,000 milliseconds.
    Tween.js also allows you to define how this property is changed over time. This
    can be done using linear, quadratic, or any of the other possibilities (see [http://sole.github.io/tween.js/examples/03_graphs.html](http://sole.github.io/tween.js/examples/03_graphs.html)

    to each other, so these tweens will start looping when started. The final thing
    we define here is the `onUpdate` method. In this method, we walk through all the
    vertices of the particle system and change their position according to the position
    provided by the tween (`this.pos`).'

    The `THREE.Clock` object can be used to exactly calculate the elapsed time that
    a specific invocation or rendering loop takes to complete. You can do this by
    calling the `clock.getDelta()` function. This function will return the elapsed
    time between this call and the previous call to `getDelta()`. To update the position
    of the camera, we call the `trackballControls.update()` function. In this function,
    we need to provide the time that has passed since the last time this update function
    was called. For this, we use the `getDelta()` function from the `THREE.Clock`
    object. You might wonder why we don't just pass in the frame rate (1/60 seconds)
    to the `update` function. The reason is that with `requestAnimationFrame`, we
    can expect 60 fps, but this isn't guaranteed. Depending on all kinds of external
    factors, the frame rate might change. To make sure the camera turns and rotates
    smoothly, we need to pass in the exact elapsed time.

    folder). This is a model of a hand, complete with a set of bones. By moving the

    `skinning` property of the material you use to `true`. If you don''t set this

    we set the `useQuaternion` property of all the bones to `false`. In this example,

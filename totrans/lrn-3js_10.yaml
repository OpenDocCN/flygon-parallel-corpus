    define the colors of the mesh, but you can also use them to define shininess,
    bumps, and reflections. The first example we look at, though, is the most basic

    so that you can apply and map the light map independently of the other textures.

    created based on the type of geometry you created. In most cases, you don''t really

    the UV mapping, you need to define, for each face, what part of the texture should
    be shown. You do this by defining the `u` and `v` coordinates for each of the

    use any image in the PNG, JPG, GIF, TGA, DDS, or PVR format as a texture. Loading
    these images is done asynchronously, so remember to either use a rendering loop
    or add a callback when you load the texture. With textures, you can create great-looking
    objects from low-poly models and even add fake detailed depth using bump maps
    and normal maps. With Three.js, it is also easy to create dynamic textures using
    either the HTML5 canvas element or the video element. Just define a texture with
    these elements as the input and set the `needsUpdate` property to `true` whenever

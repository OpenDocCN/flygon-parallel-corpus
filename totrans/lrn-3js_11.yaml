    3D Scene with Three.js*, we set up a rendering loop that we've used throughout
    the book to render and animate our scene. For postprocessing, we need to make
    a couple of changes to this setup to allow Three.js to postprocess the final rendering.
    In the first section, we'll look at how to do this.

    `THREE.RenderPass` renders the scene, and `THREE.ShaderPass`, when configured
    with `THREE.CopyShader`, renders the output, without any further postprocessing
    to the screen if we set the `renderToScreen` property to `true`. If you look at
    the example, you can see that we show the same scene four times but with a different
    effect applied each time. We could render the scene from scratch using `THREE.RenderPass`
    four times, but that would be a bit of a waste since we can just reuse the output
    from this first composer. To do this, we create `THREE.TexturePass` and pass in
    the `composer.renderTarget2` value. We can now use the `renderScene` variable
    as input for our other composers without having to render the scene from scratch.
    Let's revisit `THREE.FilmPass` first and see how we can use `THREE.TexturePass`

    After `THREE.MaskPass`, we add the effect we want to apply (`effectSepia` in this
    case), and once we're done with that, we add `THREE.ClearMaskPass` to remove the
    mask. The last step for this specific `THREE.EffectComposer` is one we've already

    vertex shader provided by Three.js. An important point to make before looking

    you saw, creating `THREE.EffectComposer` and chaining passes together is actually
    very easy. You just have to keep in mind a few things. Not all passes output to
    the screen. If you want to output to the screen, you can always use `THREE.ShaderPass`
    with `THREE.CopyShader`. The sequence in which you add passes to a composer is
    important. Effects are applied in that sequence. If you want to reuse the result
    from a specific `THREE.EffectComposer` instance, you can do this by using `THREE.TexturePass`.
    When you have more than one `THREE.RenderPass` in your `THREE.EffectComposer`,
    make sure to set the `clear` property to `false`. If not, you'll only see the
    output from the last `THREE.RenderPass` step. If you only want to apply an effect
    to a specific object, you can use `THREE.MaskPass`. When you're done with the
    mask, clear the mask with `THREE.ClearMaskPass`. Besides the standard passes provided
    by Three.js, there are also a large number of standard shaders available. You
    can use these together with `THREE.ShaderPass`. Creating custom shaders for postprocessing
    is very easy using the standard approach from Three.js. You only need to create
    a fragment shader.

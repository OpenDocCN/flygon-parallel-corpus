- en: Data recovery is a powerful concept within digital forensics. It is the process
    of retrieving deleted data from a device or SD card when it cannot be accessed
    normally. Being able to recover data that is deleted by a user could help solve
    several civil and criminal cases. This is because most of the accused just delete
    the details on the device, hoping that the evidence will be destroyed. Thus, in
    most of the criminal cases, deleted data can be crucial, because it may contain
    information the user wanted to erase from the Android device. For example, consider
    the scenario where a mobile phone has been seized from a terrorist.

    by them? Access to any deleted SMS messages, pictures, dialed numbers, and so
    on can be of critical importance, as they may reveal a lot of sensitive information.
    From a normal user's point of view, recovering data that has been deleted would
    usually refer to the operating system's built-in solutions, such as the Recycle
    Bin in Windows. While it's true that data can be recovered from these locations,
    due to an increase in user awareness, these options don't often work. For instance,
    on a desktop computer, people now use *Shift* + *Delete* whenever they want to
    delete a file completely from their desktop. Similarly, within mobile environments,
    users are aware of restore operations provided by apps and so on. In spite of
    this, data recovery techniques allow a forensic investigator to access the data
    that is deleted from the device.

    not lost forever, it is recommended that you keep the following points in mind:'

    on the device until the space is needed by some other incoming data. Hence, the
    phone must *not* be used for any sort of activity so that the data is not overwritten.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even when the phone is not used, without any intervention from our end, data
    can be overwritten. For instance, an incoming SMS would automatically occupy the
    space that overwrites the deleted data. Also, remote wipe commands can wipe the
    content present on the device. To prevent the occurrence of such events, you can
    consider the option of placing the device in Faraday bags, as explained in [Chapter
    1](part0014.xhtml "Chapter 1. Introducing Android Forensics"), *Introducing Android
    Forensics*. Thus, care should be taken to prevent delivery of any new messages
    or data through any means of communication.

    and continues to exist on the device. What gets deleted is the pointer to this
    data. All filesystems contain metadata that maintains information about the hierarchy
    of files, file names, and so on. Deletion does not actually erase the data, but
    instead, it removes the filesystem metadata. Just deleting the metadata increases
    the performance of operating systems; deleting the pointer and marking the space
    as available is an extremely fast operation compared to actually erasing all the
    data. Thus, when text messages or any other files are deleted, they are just made
    invisible to the user. However, the files are still present on the device as long
    as they are not overwritten by some other data.

- en: Data present on an SD card can reveal a lot of information that is useful during
    a forensic investigation. The fact that pictures, videos, voice recordings, application
    data, and so on are stored on the SD card adds weight to this. As mentioned in
    the previous chapters, Android devices often use the FAT32 filesystem on the SD
    card. The main reason for this is that the FAT32 filesystem is widely supported
    in most operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. The maximum
    file size on a FAT32-formatted drive is around 4 GB. With increasingly high resolution
    formats that are now available, this limit is commonly reached. Recovering the
    data deleted from an external SD can be pretty easy if it can be mounted as a
    drive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the SD card is removable, it can be mounted as a drive by connecting it to
    a computer using a card reader. Any files can be transferred to the SD card while
    it's mounted. Some of the older devices that use USB mass storage also mount the
    device as a drive when connected through a USB cable. As explained earlier, in
    forensics, in order to make sure that the original evidence is not modified, a
    physical image of the disk is taken, and all further experimentation is done on
    the image itself. Similarly, in the case of SD card analysis, an image of the
    SD card needs to be taken. The process of imaging is similar to the one explained
    in [Chapter 5](part0040.xhtml "Chapter 5. Extracting Data Physically from Android
    Devices"), *Extracting Data Physically from Android Devices*. Once the imaging
    is done, we get a `dd` image file. In our example, we will use a free tool, FTK
    Imager. This tool is an imaging utility, and in addition to creating disk images,
    it can also be used to explore the contents of a disk image.

    is because these devices do not support USB mass storage and, instead, use the
    MTP or PTP protocol. With USB mass storage, the computer would need exclusive
    access to the storage. In other words, the external storage needs to be completely
    disconnected from the Android OS when it is connected to a workstation. This leads
    to several other complications with respect to mobile apps. When an Android device
    uses MTP, it appears to the computer as a media device and not as removable storage,

    perform a scan, though this is not a recommended procedure as it might result
    in changes being made to the device. Hence, most of the latest devices that use
    MTP/PTP are not treated as mount drives. So, the traditional data-recovery tools
    that work for computers do not work on these devices.
  prefs: []

    as a drive, the recovery can be done by certain Android-specific data-recovery
    tools that need the USB debugging option to be turned on. Almost all the Android
    data-recovery tools on the market need you to enable USB debugging so that your
    device and the SD card can be recognized before starting Android data recovery.

    internal memory may not be recognized and mounted by forensic tools. Second, the
    examiner cannot get access to the raw partitions of the internal memory of an
    Android phone, unless the phone is rooted. The following are some of the other
    issues the examiner may face when attempting to recover data from the internal

    many of the recovery tools designed for use with Windows filesystems won't work.

    While most forensic tools provide access to the database files, they may have

    device is difficult, but not impossible. The internal memory of Android devices
    holds the bulk of the user data and the possible keys to your investigation. As
    mentioned earlier, the device must be rooted in order to access the raw partitions.
    It's important to note that most of the Android-recovery tools on the market do
    not highlight the fact that they work only on rooted phones. Hardware-based solutions,
    such as UFED and XRY, are fully capable of recovering deleted data from internal
    memory as well as SD cards. Let's now see how we can recover deleted data from

    it is possible to recover the deleted data, such as text messages, contacts, and
    more, by analyzing these SQLite files. There are two areas within a SQLite page
    that can contain deleted data: unallocated blocks and free blocks. Most of the
    commercial tools that recover deleted data scan the unallocated blocks and free
    blocks of the SQLite pages. Parsing the deleted data can be done using the available

    with 0xffd9\. The locations of the header and footer are identified, and everything
    between these two endpoints is carved. Similarly, the file structure carving method
    is based on the internal layout of a file to reconstruct the file. However, the
    traditional file-carving techniques, such as the ones we've already explained,

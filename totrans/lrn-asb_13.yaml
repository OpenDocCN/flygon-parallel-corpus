  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we created a playbook that generated a playbook to remediate
    any PCI-DSS non-compliance errors found during a scan. As well as being really
    cool, it is also really practical if you imagine you are running a few dozen servers
    that all need to be compliant, and also that they all need a full audit history.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You now have the foundations of a playbook that you can use to target those
    hosts daily, to both audit them and store the results away from the host itself,
    but also depending on your configuration, you have a way of automatically resolving
    any non-conformance found during the scan.

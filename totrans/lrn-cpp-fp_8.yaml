- en: We will now develop the functional class so we can consume it to our functional
    program. Before that, let's prepare a new imperative class named `Customer`. The
    class will have an `int` property named `id` as a unique customer ID number. It
    also has four string properties to store the information about our customer--`name`,
    `address`, `phoneNumber`, and `email`. The class also has a flag--`isActive`--to
    indicate whether or not our customer is active. If the customer has signed a contract
    with us, they are regarded as an active customer. Another property is `registeredCustomers`,
    to save all registered customers we have, regardless of the active customer. We
    will make the `registeredCustomers` member become `static` so we can fill it from
    outside the class and can keep the list of the `Customer` class.

    in the `Customer` class. For instance, in the `GetActiveCustomerNames()` method,
    the code loops each element in the `registeredCustomers` vector to find out the
    active customer. If it finds them, the code will extract the name of each customer
    and store it to the `returnList` vector. After finishing the method process, the
    method will feed the `returnList` result to the method user.

    public property of the `Customer` class, `registeredCustomers`, with a bunch of
    our customer information. After that, the code instances the `Customer` class
    and invokes the method of the class named `GetActiveCustomerNames()`. As we can
    see, the method returns a vector of string that contains the list of active customer
    names that we will then store in the `activeCustomerNames` vector. Now, we can
    iterate the vector to extract the list of the active customer names. The following
    is the output we should see in the console:'

    are active, so not all of the names will be listed in the preceding output. We

    specifically, their addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Our goal in
    this chapter is to use the concepts we've learned in the previous chapters and
    make an application using the functional approach. So, let's see how we can achieve

    invoked its methods. However, the class can still be tweaked by transforming it
    into a functional class. As we can see in the preceding code, we can implement
    a pure function, first-class function, higher-order function, and memoization
    to it to make it become functional. So, in this section, we will refactor the
    `Customer` class to become a functional class and use the knowledge we have from
    the previous chapters. In the upcoming section, we will implement the functional
    method that we have discussed in the previous chapter, which is the first-class
    function.

- en: In the last chapter of this book, we developed the functional class successfully
    by refactoring it from the imperative class that we can use to create a more complex
    program with. We implemented what we learned in the previous chapters. We also
    discussed the debugging technique, which is a useful weapon when we face an unexpected
    result or get a crash in the middle of the program.

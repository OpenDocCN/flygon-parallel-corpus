    is a one-way relationship where the lives of objects are independent from each
    other. For example, the child and parent relationship is an aggregation, because
    every child has parent but it''s not necessary that every parent has child.'

    single room cannot belong to multiple houses. If we demolished the house, the

    is an activity performed at compile-time as instructed with the help of the syntax.
    The class that inherits another class is known as the child or derived class,
    and the class which is being inherited is known as the base or parent class. Here,
    derived classes inherit all the features of base classes either to implement or
    to override.

    this is a contract for the class or structure that will implement to define the
    signatures of the functionality. With the use of interface, you make sure that
    whenever a class or struct implement it that class or struct is going to use the
    contract of the interface. For an instance if ICalculator interface has method
    Add() that means whenever a class or structure implement this interface it provides
    a specific contractual functionality that is addition.

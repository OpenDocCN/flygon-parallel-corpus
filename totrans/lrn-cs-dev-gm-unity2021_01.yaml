    geeky hackers. People possessing extraordinary mental gifts for algorithmic thought,
    little social IQ, and the odd anarchic bent. While this is not the case, there
    is something to the idea that learning to code fundamentally changes the way you
    look at the world. The good news is your naturally curious mind already wants
    to see these kinds of patterns in the world, and you may even come to enjoy this
    new way of thinking.

    ceiling fan before you go to sleep, you're unconsciously using analytical skills
    that translate to programming—you're just missing the right language and syntax
    to map those life skills into code. You know your age, right? That's a variable.
    When you cross the street, I presume you look down the road in both directions
    before stepping off the curb like the rest of us. That's evaluating different
    conditions, better known as control flow in programming terminology. When you
    look at a can of pop, you instinctively identify that it has certain properties
    like shape, weight, and contents. That's a class object! You get the idea.

    at a basic level at the beginning of our journey, and in more detail in *Chapter

    **This is an essential requirement**. It's OK if you don't know what a class is
    quite yet. The important thing to remember is that, in Unity, the filename and
    the class name need to be the same. If you're using C# outside of Unity, the filename
    and class name don't have to match.

    geeky hackers. People possessing extraordinary mental gifts for algorithmic thought,
    little social IQ, and the odd anarchic bent. While this is not the case, there
    is something to the idea that learning to code fundamentally changes the way you
    look at the world. The good news is your naturally curious mind already wants
    to see these kinds of patterns in the world, and you may even come to enjoy this
    new way of thinking.

    ceiling fan before you go to sleep, you're unconsciously using analytical skills
    that translate to programming—you're just missing the right language and syntax
    to map those life skills into code. You know your age, right? That's a variable.
    When you cross the street, I presume you look down the road in both directions
    before stepping off the curb like the rest of us. That's evaluating different
    conditions, better known as control flow in programming terminology. When you
    look at a can of pop, you instinctively identify that it has certain properties
    like shape, weight, and contents. That's a class object! You get the idea.

    of Microsoft's C# resources. For starters, the Microsoft Learn documentation at
    [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
    has a ton of great tutorials, quickstart guides, and how-to articles. You can
    also find great overviews of individual C# topics at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/index](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/index).

    the reference guides are the place to go. These reference guides are an important
    resource for any C# programmer, but since they aren't always the easiest to navigate,
    let's take a few minutes to learn how to find what we're looking for.

    all bundled up into one, but its saving grace is the subtopic list on the right-hand
    side. Use it well! It's extremely important to know where to find help when you're
    stuck or have a question, so be sure to circle back to this section whenever you
    hit a roadblock.

    eye, and C# is no exception. The good news is beneath the initial mystery, all
    programming languages are made up of the same essential building blocks. Variables,
    methods, and classes (or objects) make up the DNA of conventional programming;
    understanding these simple concepts opens up an entire world of diverse and complex
    applications. After all, there are only four different DNA nucleobases in every
    person on earth; yet, here we are, every one of us a unique organism.

    least). However, we still need to understand how everything we've learned in this
    chapter applies in the Unity game engine, which is what we'll be focusing on in
    the next section!

    housekeeping before wrapping up this chapter. Specifically, we need to know more
    about how Unity handles C# scripts attached to game objects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All GameObject components are scripts, whether they're written by you or the
    good people at Unity. The only difference is that Unity-specific components such
    as `Transform`, and their respective scripts just aren't supposed to be edited
    by users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The moment a script that you have created is dropped onto a GameObject, it becomes
    another component of that object, which is why it appears in the **Inspector**
    panel. To Unity, it walks, talks, and acts like any other component, complete
    with public variables underneath the component that can be changed at any time.
    Even though we aren't supposed to edit the components provided by Unity, we can
    still access their properties and methods, making them powerful development tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unity also makes some automatic readability adjustments when a script becomes
    a component. You might have noticed in *Figures 2.3* and *2.5* that when we added
    `LearningCurve` to Main Camera, Unity displayed it as `Learning Curve`, with `CurrentAge`
    changing to `Current Age`.

    it, the changes would be retained.

    Play Mode. If you need to undo any changes made in the **Inspector** panel, you
    can reset the script to its default (sometimes called initial) values. Click on
    the three vertical dots icon to the right of any component, and then select **Reset**,

- en: Since C# scripts are classes, how does Unity know to make some scripts components
    and not others? The short answer is that `LearningCurve` (and any script created
    in Unity) inherits from `MonoBehaviour` (a default class provided by Unity). This
    tells Unity that the C# class can be transformed into a component.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The topic of class inheritance is a bit advanced for this point of your programming
    journey; think of it as the `MonoBehaviour` class lending a few of its variables
    and methods to `LearningCurve`. *Chapter 5*, *Working with Classes, Struct, and
    OOP*, will cover class inheritance in practical detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `Start()` and `Update()` methods that we've used belong to `MonoBehaviour`,
    which Unity runs automatically on any script attached to a GameObject. The `Start()`
    method runs once when the scene starts playing, while the `Update()` method runs
    once per frame (depending on the frame rate of your machine).

    theory of fundamental concepts such as variables, methods, and classes will give
    you a strong foundation to build on. Bear in mind that these building blocks have
    very real counterparts in the real world. Variables hold values like mailboxes
    hold letters; methods store instructions like recipes, to be followed for a predefined
    result; and classes are blueprints just like real blueprints. You can't build
    a house without a well-thought-out design to follow if you expect it to stay standing.

    them. Normally, this would be cause for a paradox, but programming is a special

    the words you use every day and the code in Visual Studio comes from missing context,
    which is something that has to be learned all over again. You know how to say
    and spell the words used in C#, but what you don't know is where, when, why, and,
    most importantly, how they make up the syntax of the language.

    the instructions, which, in our example, would be `GenerateCharacter("Spike",

    argument if need be.

    methods that come with any new Unity C# script: `Start()` and `Update()`. Unlike
    the methods we define ourselves, methods belonging to the `MonoBehaviour` class
    are called automatically by the Unity engine according to their respective rules.
    In most cases, it''s important to have at least one `MonoBehaviour` method in

- en: The Start method
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unity calls the `Start()` method on the first frame where a script is enabled
    for the first time. Since `MonoBehaviour` scripts are almost always attached to
    *GameObjects* in a scene, their attached scripts are enabled at the same time
    they are loaded when you hit play. In our project, `LearningCurve`is attached
    to the **Main Camera** *GameObject*, which means that its `Start()` method runs
    when the main camera is loaded into the scene. `Start()` is primarily used to
    set up variables or perform logic that needs to happen before `Update()` runs
    for the first time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The examples we've worked on so far have all used `Start()`, even though they
    weren't performing setup actions, which isn't normally the way it would be used.
    However, it only fires once, making it an excellent tool to use for displaying
    one-time-only information on the console.

    ([https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/)),
    you'll notice that a vast majority of the code is executed using the `Update()`
    method. As your game runs, the Scene window is displayed many times per second,
    which is called the frame rate or **frames per second** (**FPS**).

    it one of the most executed methods in your game. This makes it ideal for detecting
    mouse and keyboard input or running gameplay logic.

    its building blocks into the strata of real code and C# syntax. We've seen good
    and bad forms of code formatting, learned how to debug information in the Unity
    console, and created our first variables.

    how to properly harness their power into useful behaviors. Input parameters, return
    types, and method signatures are all important topics, but the real gift they
    offer is the potential for new kinds of actions to be performed.

    conditions are met. When you click on a folder, you expect it to open; when you
    type on the keyboard, you expect the text to mirror your keystrokes. Writing code
    for applications or games is no different—they both need to behave in a certain
    way in one state, and in another when conditions change. In programming terms,
    this is called control flow, which is apt because it controls the flow of how
    code is executed in different scenarios.

    when it comes to iteration statements: *infinite loops*. These are exactly what
    they sound like: when a loop''s conditions make it impossible for it to stop running
    and move on in the program. Infinite loops usually happen in `for` and `while`
    loops when the iterator is not increased or decreased; if the `PlayerLives` line
    of code was left out of the `while` loop example, Unity would freeze and/or crash,
    recognizing that `PlayerLives` would always be 3 and execute the loop forever.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Iterators are not the only culprits to be aware of; setting conditions in a
    `for` loop that will never fail, or evaluate to false, can also cause infinite
    loops. In the party members example, from the *Looping through key-value pairs*
    section, if we had set the `for` loop condition to `i < 0` instead of `i < QuestPartyMembers.Count`,
    `i` would always be less than `0`, looping until Unity crashed.

    and what we can build with that new knowledge. We know how to use simple `if-else`
    checks and more complex `switch` statements, allowing decision making in code.
    We can create variables that hold collections of values with arrays and lists
    or key-value pairs with dictionaries. This allows complex and grouped data to
    be stored efficiently. We can even choose the right looping statement for each
    collection type, while carefully avoiding infinite-loop crashes.

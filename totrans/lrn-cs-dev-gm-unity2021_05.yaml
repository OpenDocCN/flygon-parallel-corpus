    from information overload. However, these next topics will take you out of the
    beginner''s cubicle and into the open air of **object-oriented programming** (**OOP**).
    Up to this point, we''ve been relying exclusively on predefined variable types
    that are part of the C# language: under-the-hood strings, lists, and dictionaries
    that are classes, which is why we can create them and use their properties through
    dot notation. However, relying on built-in types has one glaring weakness—the
    inability to deviate from the blueprints that C# has already set.'

    and struct instances are the blueprints of our programs, then OOP is the architecture
    that holds everything together. When we refer to OOP as a programming paradigm,
    we are saying that it has specific principles for how the overall program should
    work and communicate.

    about how classes are blueprints for objects and mentioned that they can be treated
    as custom variable types. We also learned that the `LearningCurve`script is a
    class, but a special one that Unity can attach to objects in the scene. The main
    thing to remember with classes is that they are *reference types*—that is, when
    they are assigned or passed to another variable, the original object is referenced,
    not a new copy. We'll get into this after we discuss structs. However, before
    any of that, we need to understand the basics of creating classes.

    the repeated code, making it easier to modify and call that functionality elsewhere

    sometimes referred to as *calling code*). Take our soda can as an example—in a
    vending machine, the possible interactions are limited. Since the machine is locked,
    not just anyone can come up and grab one; if you happen to have the right change,
    you'll be allowed provisional access to it, but in a specified quantity. If the
    machine itself is locked inside a room, only someone with the door key will even
    know the soda can exists.

    having to repeat code. Take the soda example again—there are generic sodas on
    the market that have all the same basic properties, and then there are special
    sodas. The special sodas share the same basic properties but have different branding,

    the objects themselves into the **Inspector** tab. Let's demonstrate how to do
    that in the following section.

- en: Now that we've covered the code-intensive way of doing things, let's take a
    quick look at Unity's drag and drop functionality. Although dragging and dropping
    is much faster than using the `GameObject` class in code, Unity sometimes loses
    the connections between objects and variables made this way when saving or exporting
    projects, or when Unity updates.

    of this feature. For most cases, I'd advise sticking with code.

    variable. No code was involved because Unity assigned the variable internally,
    with no change to the `LearningCurve`class.

- en: It is important to understand a few things when deciding whether to assign variables
    using drag and drop or `GameObject.Find()`. First, the `Find()` method is marginally
    slower, leaving your game open to performance issues if you are calling the method
    multiple times in multiple scripts. Second, you need to be sure your GameObjects
    all have unique names in the scene hierarchy; if they don't, it may lead to some
    nasty bugs in situations where you have several objects of the same name or change
    the object names themselves.

- en: Our journey into classes, structs, and OOP marks the end of the first section
    on the fundamentals of C#. You've learned how to declare your classes and structs,
    which is the scaffolding for every application or game you'll ever make. You've
    also identified the differences in how these two objects are passed and accessed
    and how they relate to OOP. Finally, you got hands-on with the tenets of OOP—creating
    classes using inheritance, composition, and polymorphism.

    and using instances to build interactions are a strong foundation for approaching
    any program or game. Add the ability to access components to the mix, and you've
    got the makings of a Unity developer.

    object behavior directly in Unity. We'll start by fleshing out the requirements
    of a simple open-world adventure game, work with GameObjects in the scene, and
    finish off with a white-boxed environment ready for our characters.

    character movement (if, of course, the game has a moveable character) and camera
    controls. Not only is this exciting, but it lets your player know what kind of
    gameplay they can expect. The character in *Hero Born* will be a capsule object
    that can be moved and rotated using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, or arrow keys, respectively.

    along from a position that is slightly behind and above the player, making aiming
    easier when we implement the shooting mechanic. Finally, we'll explore how collisions

    0\. Likewise, when the right arrow or `D` keys are used, the horizontal axis registers
    a value of 1\. This allows us to capture four different inputs for a single axis

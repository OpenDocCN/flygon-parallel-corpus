  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common misconception when learning to program is that all variables should
    automatically be made public, but in general, this is not a good idea. In my experience,
    variables should be thought of as protected and private from the start, and only
    made public if necessary. One way you'll see experienced programmers protect their
    data is through manager classes, and since we want to build good habits, we'll
    be following suit. Think of manager classes as a funnel where important variables
    and methods can be accessed safely.
  prefs: []

    context. However, when you have different classes communicating and updating data
    with each other, things can get messy. That's why having a single contact point,
    such as a manager class, can keep this to a minimum. We'll get into how to do
    that effectively in the following section.

    other classes could change them at will, which could lead to the variables storing
    incorrect or concurrent data.

- en: Right now, our win condition works as expected, but the player still has control
    over the capsule and doesn't have a way of restarting the game once it's over.
    Unity provides a property in the `Time` class called `timeScale`, which when set
    to `0` freezes the game scene. However, to restart the game, we need access to
    a **namespace** called `SceneManagement` that isn't accessible from our classes
    by default.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A namespace collects and groups a set of classes under a specific name to organize
    large projects and avoid conflicts between scripts that may share the same names.
    A `using` directive needs to be added to a class to access a namespace's classes.

    that can be added with the `using` keyword followed by the name of the namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since our game will need to be paused and restarted when a player wins or loses,
    this is a good time to use a namespace that isn't included in new C# scripts by
    default.

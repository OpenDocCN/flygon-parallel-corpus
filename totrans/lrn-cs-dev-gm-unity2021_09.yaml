    with long working hours and frustration. However, Unity has built-in features,
    components, and classes we can use to design and implement AI systems in a more
    user-friendly way. These tools will push the first playable iteration of *Hero

    call to `Debug.Log()`, iterating over each item sequentially. The idea now is

    a check for those collisions in `EnemyBehavior` with `OnCollisionEnter()`.

    we decrement `EnemyLives` by `1` and print out another message.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice that the name we're checking for is `Bullet(Clone)`, even though our
    bullet Prefab is named `Bullet`. This is because Unity adds the `(Clone)` suffix
    to any object created with the `Instantiate()` method, which is how we made them
    in our shooting logic.

- en: Now, the player can fight back when the enemy tries to take one of its lives
    by shooting it three times and destroying it. Again, our use of the `get` and
    `set` properties to handle additional logic proves to be a flexible and scalable
    solution. With that done, your final task is to update the game manager with a
    loss condition.

    Before we finish this chapter, there's one more important topic that we need to
    discuss, and that's how to avoid repeating code.

    conscience: it tells you when you''re in danger of making a bad or questionable
    decision, and gives you a feeling of satisfaction after a job well done.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, repeated code is part of programming life. Trying to avoid it by
    constantly thinking ahead will put up so many roadblocks in your project that
    it won't seem worthwhile carrying on. A more efficient—and sane—approach to dealing
    with repeating code is to quickly identify it when and where it occurs and then
    look for the best way to remove it. This task is called refactoring, and our `GameBehavior`
    class could use a little of its magic right now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    places, but we could easily make ourselves a utility method to do this for us
    in a single place.

- en: With that, our enemy and player interactions are complete. We can dish out damage
    as well as take it, lose lives, and fight back, all while updating the on-screen
    GUI. Our enemies use Unity's navigation system to walk around the arena and change
    to attack mode when within a specified range of the player. Each GameObject is
    responsible for its behavior, internal logic, and object collisions, while the
    game manager keeps track of the variables that govern the game's state. Lastly,
    we learned about simple procedural programming and how much cleaner code can be
    when repeated instructions are abstracted out into their methods.

    this book as a total beginner. Getting up to speed with a new programming language
    while building a working game is no easy trick. In the next chapter, you'll be
    introduced to some intermediate topics in C#, including new type modifiers, method
    overloading, interfaces, and class extensions.

    examples of generic programming concepts, delegation, event creation, and error
    handling. Each of these topics is a large area of study in its own right, so take
    what you learn here and expand on it in your projects. After we complete our practical

- en: All of our code so far has been very specific in terms of defining and using
    types. However, there will be cases where you need a class or method to treat
    its entities in the same way, regardless of its type, while still being type-safe.
    Generic programming allows us to create reusable classes, methods, and variables
    using a placeholder, rather than a concrete type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a generic class instance is created at compile time or a method is used,
    a concrete type will be assigned, but the code itself treats it as a generic type.
    Being able to write generic code is a huge benefit when you need to work with
    different object types in the same way, for example, custom collection types that
    need to be able to perform the same operations on elements regardless of type,
    or classes that need the same underlying functionality. While you might be asking
    yourself why we don't just subclass or use interfaces, you'll see in our examples
    that generics help us in a different way.

    and personal benchmark in your programming journey. Before you start yelling "Why
    would I add errors when I've spent all this time trying to avoid them?!", you
    should know that I don't mean adding errors to break your existing code. It's
    quite the opposite—including errors or exceptions and handling them appropriately
    when pieces of functionality are used incorrectly makes your code base stronger
    and less prone to crashes, not weaker.

    which is an apt visual analogy. Throwing exceptions is part of something called
    defensive programming, which essentially means that you actively and consciously
    guard against improper or unplanned operations in your code. To mark those situations,
    you throw out an exception from a method that is then handled by the calling code.

    manager logic is executed. We don't have any other scenes configured in our game
    at the moment, but this defensive code acts as a safeguard and doesn't let us
    take an action that might crash the game (Unity doesn't support negative indexes

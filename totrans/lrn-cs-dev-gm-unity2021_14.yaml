    about what we accomplished, but also about how the different parts of our project
    work together. Our code is modular, meaning actions and logic are self-contained.
    Our code is flexible because we've used **object-oriented programming** (**OOP**)
    techniques, which makes it easy to improve and update. Our code is clean and doesn't
    repeat, making it readable to anyone who looks at it down the line, even if that's

- en: Even though Unity is a 3D game engine, it still has to follow the principles
    set down by the code it's built on. When you think of your game, remember that
    the GameObjects, components, and systems you see on screen are just visual representations
    of classes and data; they're not magical or unknown—they're the result of taking
    the programming foundations you've learned in this book to their advanced conclusion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everything in Unity is an object, but that doesn't mean all C# classes have
    to work within the engine's `MonoBehaviour` framework. Don't be limited to thinking
    only about in-game mechanics; branch out and define your data or behavior the
    way your project needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Lastly, always ask yourself how you can best separate code out into pieces
    of functionality instead of creating huge, bloated, thousand-line classes. Related
    code should be responsible for its behavior and stored together. That means creating
    separate `MonoBehaviour` classes and attaching them to the GameObjects they affect.
    I said it at the beginning of this book and I''ll say it again: programming is
    more a mindset and contextual framework than syntax memorization. Keep training
    your brain to think like a programmer and eventually, you won''t be able to see
    the world any differently.'

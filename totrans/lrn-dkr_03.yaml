- en: Docker containers were first developed on Linux for Linux. It is hence natural
    that the primary command-line tool used to work with Docker, also called a shell,
    is a Unix shell; remember, Linux derives from Unix. Most developers use the Bash
    shell. On some lightweight Linux distributions, such as Alpine, Bash is not installed
    and consequently one has to use the simpler Bourne shell, just called *sh*. Whenever we are
    working in a Linux environment, such as inside a container or on a Linux VM, we
    will use either `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`, depending on their availability.

    of Unix and hence support the same set of tools. Among those tools are the shells.
    So, when working on macOS, you will probably be using the Bash shell.

    available. The most familiar is the command shell. It has been available on any
    Windows computer for decades. It is a very simple shell. For more advanced scripting,
    Microsoft has developed PowerShell. PowerShell is very powerful and very popular
    among engineers working on Windows. On Windows 10, finally, we have the so-called* Windows
    Subsystem for Linux*, which allows us to use any Linux tool, such as the Bash
    or Bourne shells. Apart from this, there are also other tools that install a Bash
    shell on Windows, for example, the Git Bash shell. In this book, all commands
    will use Bash syntax. Most of the commands also run in PowerShell.

    course, which editor is the best is highly controversial and depends on your personal
    preference. A lot of people use Vim, or others such as Emacs, Atom, Sublime, or **Visual
    Studio Code** (**VS Code**), to just name a few. VS Code is a completely free
    and lightweight editor, yet it is very powerful and is available for macOS, Windows,
    and Linux. According to Stack Overflow, it is currently by far the most popular
    code editor. If you are not yet sold on another editor, I highly recommend that
    you give VS Code a try.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    As long as you can edit text files, you're good to go. If your editor supports
    syntax highlighting for Dockerfiles and JSON and YAML files, then even better.
    The only exception will be [Chapter 6](b6647803-2c5c-4b9d-9a4a-a836ac356329.xhtml),

    elegantly with containers on any macOS or Windows computer. Containers must run
    on a Linux host. Neither Windows nor macOS can run containers natively. Hence,
    we need to run a Linux VM on our laptop, where we can then run our containers.
    Docker Toolbox installs VirtualBox on our laptop, which is used to run the Linux
    VMs we need.

    containers that run natively on Windows, and you are right. Microsoft has ported
    Docker Engine to Windows and it is possible to run Windows containers directly
    on Windows Server 2016 or newer, without the need for a VM. So, now we have two
    flavors of containers, Linux containers and Windows containers. The former only
    runs on a Linux host and the latter only runs on a Windows server. In this book,

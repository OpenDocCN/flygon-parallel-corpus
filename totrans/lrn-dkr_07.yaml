    meant to be stateless. How are we going to deal with this? One way is to use Docker
    volumes. Volumes allow containers to consume, produce, and modify a state. Volumes
    have a life cycle that goes beyond the life cycle of containers. When a container
    that uses a volume dies, the volume continues to exist. This is great for the
    durability of the state.

    their data beyond the lifetime of the container. In this case, they can use volumes.
    To make things a bit more explicit, let's look at a concrete example. MongoDB
    is a popular open source document database. Many developers use MongoDB as a storage
    service for their applications. The maintainers of MongoDB have created an image
    and published it on Docker Hub, which can be used to run an instance of the database
    in a container. This database will be producing data that needs to be persisted
    long term, but the MongoDB maintainers do not know who uses this image and how
    it is used. So, they have no influence over the `docker container run` command
    with which the users of the database will start this container. *How can they
    now define volumes?*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Luckily, there is a way of defining volumes in the `Dockerfile`. The keyword
    to do so is `VOLUME`, and we can either add the absolute path to a single folder

    filesystem. Let''s look at a few samples of such volume definitions, as follows:'

    it to the corresponding target folder of the container for each path defined in

    of the volumes is properly backed up.

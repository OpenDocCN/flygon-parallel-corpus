    a developer to evolve, modify, debug, and test their code while running in a container.
    With these techniques at hand, you will enjoy a frictionless development process
    for applications running in a container, similar to what you experience when developing
    applications that run natively.

    simply means *all IPv4 addresses on the local machine*. If a host has two IP addresses,
    say `52.11.32.13` and `10.11.0.1`, and a server running on the host listens on
    `0.0.0.0`, it will be reachable at both of those IPs.

    inside a container, let me make a disclaimer. What you will learn here should
    usually be your last resort, if nothing else works. Ideally, when following a
    test-driven approach when developing your application, the code is mostly guaranteed
    to work due to the fact that you have written unit and integration tests for it
    and run them against your code, which also runs in a container. Alternatively,
    if unit or integration tests don't provide you with enough insight and you really
    need to debug your code line by line, you can do so having your code running directly
    on your host, thus leveraging the support of development environments such as
    Visual Studio, Eclipse, or IntelliJ, to name just a few IDEs.

    will then make this information available to you via the `docker container logs`

    which outputs to `STDOUT`. Then, on line `8`, we define how we want the `logger`
    to format the messages it outputs. Here, the format that we chose will output
    the time and date, the application (or `logger`) name, the log severity level,
    and finally, the actual message that we developers define in code. On line `9`,
    we add the formatter to the log handler, and, on line `10`, we add the handler
    to the `logger`. Note that we can define more than one handler per logger. Now
    we are ready to use the `logger`.

- en: When we want to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in a complex distributed
    system, we need something a bit more powerful than what we have just learned.
    Of course, we can and should continue to instrument our code with meaningful logging
    messages, yet we need something more on top of that. This *more* is the capability
    to trace a single request or transaction end to end, as it flows through the system
    consisting of many application services. Ideally, we would also want to capture
    other interesting metrics such as the time spent on each component versus the
    total time that the request took.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Luckily, we do not have to reinvent the wheel. There is battle-tested open source
    software out there that helps us to achieve exactly the aforementioned goals.
    One example of such an infrastructure component or software is Jaeger ([https://www.jaegertracing.io/](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)).
    When using Jaeger, you run a central Jaeger server component and each application
    component uses a Jaeger client that will forward debug and tracing information
    transparently to the Jaeger server component. There are Jaeger clients for all
    major programming languages and frameworks, such as Node.js, Python, Java, and
    .NET.

    the whole process of tracing a request through our distributed application. We
    can use this `tracer` object and also create a `logger` object from it, which
    our application code can use to generate log items, similar to what we did in
    the previous Python and .NET examples.

    the method in the trace log produced by Jaeger.

    generate a log item of level `INFO`.

    code running inside a container. We first started by mounting the source code
    from the host into the container to avoid a rebuild of the container image each
    time the code changes. Then, we smoothed out the development process further by
    enabling automatic application restart inside the container upon code changes.
    Next, we learned how to configure Visual Studio Code to enable the full interactive
    debugging of code running inside a container. Finally, we learned how we can instrument
    our applications such that they generate logging information that can help us
    to do root cause analysis on failures or misbehaving applications or application
    services running in production.

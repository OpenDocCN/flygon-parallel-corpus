- en: At times, we may want to run a container hosting an application that automates
    certain Docker tasks. How can we do that? The Docker Engine and the Docker CLI
    are installed on the host, yet the application runs inside the container. Well,
    from early on, Docker has provided a means to bind-mount Linux sockets from the
    host into the container. On Linux, sockets are used as very efficient data communications
    endpoints between processes that run on the same host. The Docker CLI uses a socket
    to communicate with the Docker Engine; it is often called the Docker socket. If
    we can give access to the Docker socket to an application running inside a container
    then we can just install the Docker CLI inside this container, and we will then
    be able to run an application in the same container that uses this locally installed
    Docker CLI to automate container-specific tasks.

    In [Chapter 4](527543ae-a569-47dc-975d-65c96d0f6ff0.xhtml), *Creating and Managing
    Container Images*, we have learned that an image consists of a series of layers.
    Each (logical) line in a `Dockerfile` creates a layer, except the lines with the
    `CMD` and/or `ENTRYPOINT` keyword. We have also learned that the Docker builder
    tries to do its best by caching layers and reusing them if they have not changed
    between subsequent builds. But the caching only uses cached layers that occur
    before the first changed layer. All subsequent layers need to be rebuilt. That
    said, the preceding structure of the `Dockerfile` busts the image layer cache!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Why? Well, from experience, you certainly know that `npm install` can be a
    pretty expensive operation in a typical Node.js application with many external
    dependencies. The execution of this command can take from seconds to many minutes.
    That said, each time one of the source files changes, and we know that happens
    frequently during development, line 3 in the `Dockerfile` causes the corresponding
    image layer to change. Hence, the Docker builder cannot reuse this layer from
    cache, nor can it reuse the subsequent layer created by `RUN npm install`. Any
    minor change in code causes a complete rerun of `npm install`. That can be avoided.
    The `package.json` file containing the list of external dependencies rarely changes.
    With all of that information, let''s fix the `Dockerfile`:'

- en: This time, on line 3, we only copy the `package.json` file into the container,
    which rarely changes. Hence, the subsequent `npm install` command has to be executed
    equally rarely. The `COPY` command on line 5 then is a very fast operation and
    hence rebuilding an image after some code has changed only needs to rebuild this
    last layer. Build times reduce to merely a fraction of a second.

    Visual Studio Code is running inside a container, as is Python, the Python debugger,

    mounted from the host into the container and the UI part of Visual Studio Code
    also runs on the host. This opens up unlimited possibilities for developers even
    on the most restricted workstations. You can do the same for all popular languages
    and frameworks, such as .NET, C#, Java, Go, Node.js, and Ruby. If one language
    is not supported out of the box, you can craft your own development container

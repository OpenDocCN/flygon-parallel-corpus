    its single-host implementation in the form of the bridge network. This chapter
    also introduces the concept of software-defined networks and how they are used
    to secure containerized applications. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how container
    ports can be opened to the public and thus make containerized components accessible
    to the outside world. Finally, we will introduce Traefik, a reverse proxy, which
    can be used to enable sophisticated HTTP application-level routing between containers.

    a containerized business application consists of several containers that need
    to collaborate to achieve a goal. Therefore, we need a way for individual containers
    to communicate with each other. This is achieved by establishing pathways that
    we can use to send data packets back and forth between containers. These pathways are
    called **networks**. Docker has defined a very simple networking model, the so-called **container
    network model** (**CNM**), to specify the requirements that any software that
    implements a container network has to fulfill. The following is a graphical representation

    resources from unauthorized access, it is highly recommended that you design and
    run applications so that they use multiple networks and only run services on the
    same network that absolutely need to communicate with each other. In the preceding
    example, there is absolutely no need for the **webAPI** component to ever communicate
    directly with the **database** service, so we have put them on different networks.

    cannot access the **database** from there without also hacking the **productCatalog**

    model that we're going to look at in detail. This network implementation is based
    on the Linux bridge. When the Docker daemon runs for the first time, it creates
    a Linux bridge and calls it `docker0`. This is the default behavior and can be
    changed by changing the configuration. Docker then creates a network with this
    Linux bridge and calls the network `bridge`. All the containers that we create
    on a Docker host and that we do not explicitly bind to another network leads to
    Docker automatically attaching to this bridge network.

    block. IPAM is a piece of software that is used to track IP addresses that are
    used on a computer. The important part of the `IPAM` block is the `Config` node
    with its values for `Subnet` and `Gateway`. The subnet for the bridge network
    is defined by default as `172.17.0.0/16`. This means that all containers attached
    to this network will get an IP address assigned by Docker that is taken from the
    given range, which  is `172.17.0.2` to `172.17.255.255`. The `172.17.0.1` address is
    reserved for the router of this network whose role in this type of network is
    taken by the Linux bridge. We can expect that the very first container that will
    be attached to this network by Docker will get the `172.17.0.2 `address. All subsequent
    containers will get a higher number; the following diagram illustrates this fact:'

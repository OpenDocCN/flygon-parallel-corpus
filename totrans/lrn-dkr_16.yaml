    an orchestrator makes sure that all of our containerized application services
    play together nicely and contribute harmoniously to a common goal. Such orchestrators
    have quite a few responsibilities, which we discussed in detail. Finally, we provided
    a short overview of the most important container orchestrators on the market.

    on all of the concepts and objects SwarmKit uses to deploy and run distributed,
    resilient, robust, and highly available applications in a cluster on premises
    or in the cloud. This chapter also introduces how SwarmKit ensures secure applications by
    using a **Software-Defined Network** (**SDN**) to isolate containers. Additionally,
    this chapter demonstrates how to install a highly available Docker Swarm in the
    cloud. It introduces the routing mesh, which provides layer-4 routing and load
    balancing. Finally, it demonstrates how to deploy a first application consisting
    of multiple services onto the swarm.

    a Docker Swarm can have one of two roles. It can be a manager or it can be a worker.
    Manager nodes do what their name implies; they manage the Swarm. The worker nodes,
    in turn, execute the application workload.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    workload—although that is not recommended, especially if the Swarm is a production

- en: Each Docker Swarm needs to include at least one manager node. For high availability
    reasons, we should have more than one manager node in a Swarm. This is especially
    true for production or production-like environments. If we have more than one
    manager node, then these nodes work together using the Raft consensus protocol.
    The Raft consensus protocol is a standard protocol that is often used when multiple
    entities need to work together and always need to agree with each other as to
    which activity to execute next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To work well, the Raft consensus protocol asks for an odd number of members in
    what is called the consensus group. Hence, we should always have 1, 3, 5, 7, and
    so on manager nodes. In such a consensus group, there is always a leader. In the
    case of Docker Swarm, the first node that starts the Swarm initially becomes the
    leader. If the leader goes away then the remaining manager nodes elect a new leader.
    The other nodes in the consensus group are called followers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, let's assume that we shut down the current leader node for maintenance
    reasons. The remaining manager nodes will elect a new leader. When the previous
    leader node comes back online, it will now become a follower. The new leader remains
    the leader.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the members of the consensus group communicate synchronously with each
    other. Whenever the consensus group needs to make a decision, the leader asks
    all followers for agreement. If a majority of the manager nodes give a positive
    answer, then the leader executes the task. That means if we have three manager
    nodes, then at least one of the followers has to agree with the leader. If we
    have five manager nodes, then at least two followers have to agree.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since all manager follower nodes have to communicate synchronously with the
    leader node to make a decision in the cluster, the decision-making process gets
    slower and slower the more manager nodes we have forming the consensus group.
    The recommendation of Docker is to use one manager for development, demo, or test
    environments. Use three managers nodes in small to medium size Swarms, and use
    five managers in large to extra large Swarms. To use more than five managers in
    a Swarm is hardly ever justified.

    many nodes are in the Swarm and* *what are the properties of each node, such as
    name or IP address*. We also mean what containers are running on which node in
    the Swarm and more. What, on the other hand, is not included in the state of the
    Swarm is data produced by the application services running in containers on the
    Swarm. This is called application data and is definitely not part of the state
    that is managed by the manager nodes:'

    a **manager** node goes down, the remaining **managers** all have the complete
    state at hand.

    is deployed by the Swarm scheduler to a worker node. The task contains all of
    the necessary information that the worker node needs to run a container based
    on the image, which is part of the service description. Between a task and a container,

    node—by using a Linux bridge. But Linux bridges only operate locally and cannot

    an overlay network gets a so-called **VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint** (**VTEP**) object,
    which intercepts the packet (the packet at that moment is an OSI layer 2 data
    packet), wraps it with a header containing the target IP address of the host that
    runs the destination container (this makes it now an OSI layer 3 data packet),
    and sends it over the **VXLAN tunnel**. The **VTEP** on the other side of the
    tunnel unpacks the data packet and forwards it to the local bridge, which in turn
    forwards it to the destination container.

    file into our Swarm. To make sure that service names are unique, Docker decided
    to combine service name and stack name.

    makes a lookup with the given port `8080` in the IP table and will find that this
    corresponds to the VIP of the **web** service. Now, since the VIP is not a real
    target, the IPVS service will load balance the IP addresses of the tasks that
    are associated with this service. In our case, it picked task 2, with the IP address, `10.2.0.3`.

- en: A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of servers. These servers can be VMs
    or physical servers. The latter are also called *bare metal*. Each member of the
    cluster can have one of two roles. It is either a Kubernetes master or a (worker)
    node. The former is used to manage the cluster, while the latter will run an application
    workload. I have put the worker in parentheses since, in Kubernetes parlance,
    you only talk about a node when you're talking about a server that runs application
    workloads. But in Docker parlance and in Swarm, the equivalent is a *worker node*.
    I think that the notion of a worker node better describes the role of the server
    than a simple *node*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a cluster, you have a small and odd number of masters and as many worker
    nodes as needed. Small clusters might only have a few worker nodes, while more
    realistic clusters might have dozens or even hundreds of worker nodes. Technically,
    there is no limit to how many worker nodes a cluster can have; in reality, though,
    you might experience a significant slowdown in some management operations when
    dealing with thousands of nodes. All members of the cluster need to be connected
    by a physical network, the so-called **underlay network**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kubernetes defines one flat network for the whole cluster. Kubernetes does not
    provide any networking implementation out of the box; instead, it relies on plugins
    from third parties. Kubernetes just defines the **Container Network Interface** (**CNI**)
    and leaves the implementation to others. The CNI is pretty simple. It basically
    states that each pod running in the cluster must be able to reach any other pod
    also running in the cluster without any **Network** **Address** **Translation**
    (**NAT**) happening in-between. The same must be true between cluster nodes and
    pods, that is, applications or daemons running directly on a cluster node must
    be able to reach each pod in the cluster and vice versa.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the top, in the middle, we have a cluster of **etcd** nodes. **etcd** is
    a distributed key-value store that, in a Kubernetes cluster, is used to store
    all the state of the cluster. The number of **etcd** nodes has to be odd, as mandated
    by the Raft consensus protocol, which states which nodes are used to coordinate
    among themselves. When we talk about the **Cluster State**, we do not include
    data that is produced or consumed by applications running in the cluster; instead,
    we're talking about all the information on the topology of the cluster, what services
    are running, network settings, secrets used, and more. That said, this **etcd**
    cluster is really mission-critical to the overall cluster and thus, we should
    never run only a single **etcd** server in a production environment or any environment
    that needs to be highly available.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, we have a cluster of Kubernetes **master** nodes, which also form a **Consensus**
    **Group** among themselves, similar to the **etcd** nodes. The number of master
    nodes also has to be odd. We can run cluster with a single master but we should
    never do that in a production or mission-critical system. There, we should always
    have at least three master nodes. Since the master nodes are used to manage the
    whole cluster, we are also talking about the management plane. Master nodes use
    the **etcd** cluster as their backing store. It is good practice to put a **load**
    **balancer** (**LB**) in front of master nodes with a well-known **Fully Qualified
    Domain Name** (**FQDN**), such as `https://admin.example.com`. All tools that
    are used to manage the Kubernetes cluster should access it through this LB rather
    than using the public IP address of one of the master nodes. This is shown on
    the left upper side of the preceding diagram.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Toward the bottom of the diagram, we have a cluster of **worker** nodes. The
    number of nodes can be as low as one and does not have an upper limit. Kubernetes
    master and worker nodes communicate with each other. It is a bidirectional form
    of communication that is different from the one we know from Docker Swarm. In
    Docker Swarm, only manager nodes communicate with worker nodes and never the other
    way around. All ingress traffic accessing applications running in the cluster
    should go through another **load balancer**. This is the application **load**
    **balancer** or reverse proxy. We never want external traffic to directly access
    any of the worker nodes.

    have to be installed on the same node as the other Kubernetes services. Sometimes,
    Kubernetes clusters are configured to use standalone clusters of etcd servers,

    to use is an advanced management decision and is outside the scope of this book.

    or more master nodes. This is very similar to what we have learned about the manager
    nodes of a Docker Swarm. In this regard, a Kubernetes master is equivalent to
    a Swarm manager node.

    manage the cluster. Kubernetes masters build a Raft consensus group. The Raft
    protocol is a standard protocol used in situations where a group of members needs
    to make decisions. It is used in many well-known software products such as MongoDB,
    Docker SwarmKit, and Kubernetes. For a more thorough discussion of the Raft protocol,

    needs to make sure to use their own port since duplicate ports are not allowed

    At a bare minimum, we need to give the pod a name. Here, we call it `web-pod`.
    The next block that follows is the `spec` block, which contains the specification
    of the pod. The most important part (and the only one in this simple sample) is
    a list of all containers that are part of this pod. We only have one container

    objects are designed to do one thing and one thing only, and they are designed
    to do this one thing very well. In this regard, we have to understand Kubernetes
    **ReplicaSets** and **Deployments**. A **ReplicaSet**, as we have learned, is
    responsible for achieving and reconciling the desired state of an application
    service. This means that the **ReplicaSet** manages a set of pods.
  prefs: []

    functionality on top of it. In Docker Swarm, the Swarm service incorporates the
    functionality of both **ReplicaSet** and **Deployment.** In this regard, SwarmKit
    is much more monolithic than Kubernetes. The following diagram shows the relationship
    of a **Deployment** to a **ReplicaSet**:'

    of identical pods. The main characteristics of the **ReplicaSet** are that it
    is **self-healing**, **scalable**, and always does its best to reconcile the **desired**
    **state**. Kubernetes Deployment, in turn, adds rolling updates and rollback functionality
    to this. In this regard, a deployment is really a wrapper object to a ReplicaSet.

    three other services: **payments**, **shipping**, and **ordering**. The **Web
    API** should never have to care about how and where to find those three services.
    In the API code, we just want to use the name of the service we want to reach
    and its port number. A sample would be the following URL `http://payments:3000`,
    which is used to access an instance of the payments service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Kubernetes, the payments application service is represented by a ReplicaSet
    of pods. Due to the nature of highly distributed systems, we cannot assume that
    pods have stable endpoints. A pod can come and go on a whim. But that's a problem
    if we need to access the corresponding application service from an internal or
    external client. If we cannot rely on pod endpoints being stable, *what else can
    we do?*

    It provides a **reliable** cluster-wide **IP** address, also called a **virtual
    IP** (**VIP**), as well as a **reliable** **Port** that's unique in the whole
    cluster. The pods that the Kubernetes service is proxying are determined by the
    **Selector** defined in the service specification. Selectors are always based
    on labels. Every Kubernetes object can have zero to many labels assigned to it.
    In our case, the **Selector** is **app=web**; that is, all pods that have a label
    called app with a value of web are proxied.

    works when using an **IngressController**, such as Nginx. Here, we have the deployment
    of an application service called **web**. All the pods of this application service
    have the following label: **app=web**. Then, we have a Kubernetes service called
    **web** that provides a stable endpoint to those pods. The service has a (virtual)
    **IP** of `52.14.0.13` and exposes port `30044`. That is, if a request comes to
    any node of the Kubernetes cluster for the name **web** and port `30044`, then
    it is forwarded to this service. The service then load-balances the request to
    one of the pods.

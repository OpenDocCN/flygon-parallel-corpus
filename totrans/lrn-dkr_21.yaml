- en: When working with a distributed mission-critical application in production or
    in any production-like environment, then it is of utmost importance to gain as
    much insight as possible into the inner workings of those applications. Have you
    ever had a chance to look into the cockpit of an airplane or the command center
    of a nuclear power plant? Both the airplane and the power plant are samples of
    highly complex systems that deliver mission-critical services. If a plane crashes
    or a power plant shuts down unexpectedly, a lot of people are negatively affected,
    to say the least. Thus the cockpit and the command center are full of instruments
    showing the current or past state of some part of the system. What you see is
    the visual representation of some sensors that are placed in strategic parts of
    the system, and constantly collect data such as the temperature or the flow rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to the airplane or the power plant, our application needs to be instrumented
    with "sensors" that can feel the "temperature" of our application services or
    the infrastructure they run on. I put the temperature in double quotes since it
    is only a placeholder for things that matter in an application, such as the number
    of requests per second on a given RESTful endpoint, or the average latency of
    request to the same endpoint.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resulting values or readings that we collect, such as the average latency
    of requests, are often called metrics. It should be our goal to expose as many
    meaningful metrics as possible of the application services we build. Metrics can
    be both functional and non-functional. Functional metrics are values that say
    something business-relevant about the application service, such as how many checkouts
    are performed per minute if the service is part of an e-commerce application,
    or which are the five most popular songs over the last 24 hours if we're talking
    about a streaming application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Non-functional metrics are important values that are not specific to the kind
    of business the application is used for, such as what is the average latency of
    a particular web request or how many `4xx` status codes are returned per minute
    by another endpoint, or how much RAM or how many CPU cycles a given service is
    using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a distributed system where each part is exposing metrics, some overarching
    service should be collecting and aggregating the values periodically from each
    component. Alternatively, each component should forward its metrics to a central
    metrics server. Only if the metrics for all components of our highly distributed
    system are available for inspection in a central location are they of any value.
    Otherwise, monitoring the system becomes impossible. That's why pilots of an airplane
    never have to go and inspect individual and critical parts of the airplane in
    person during a flight; all necessary readings are collected and displayed in
    the cockpit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today one of the most popular services that is used to expose, collect, and
    store metrics is Prometheus. It is an open source project and has been donated
    to the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation** (**CNCF**). Prometheus has first-class
    integration with Docker containers, Kubernetes, and many other systems and programming
    platforms. In this chapter, we will use Prometheus to demonstrate how to instrument
    a simple service that exposes important metrics.

    solution like Grafana to display important metrics on a dashboard.
  prefs: []

- en: Unlike most other tools that are used to collect metrics from application services
    and infrastructure components, the Prometheus server takes the load of work and
    periodically scrapes all the defined targets. This way applications and services
    don't need to worry about forwarding data. You can also describe this as pulling
    metrics versus pushing them. This makes Prometheus servers an excellent fit for
    our case.

    much complexity or run additional services. Prometheus then is in charge of periodically
    scraping the configured targets, so that our services don't need to worry about
    emitting them.

- en: It is a recommended best practice to create minimal images for production that
    don't contain anything that is not absolutely needed. This includes common tools
    that are usually used to debug and troubleshoot an application, such as netcat,
    iostat, ip, or others. Ideally, a production system only has the container orchestration
    software such as Kubernetes installed on a cluster node with a minimal OS, such
    as Core OS. The application container in turn ideally only contains the binaries
    absolutely necessary to run. This minimizes the attack surface and the risk of
    having to deal with vulnerabilities. Furthermore, a small image has the advantage
    of being downloaded quickly, using less space on disk and in memory and showing
    faster startup times.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this can be a problem if one of the application services running on our
    Kubernetes cluster shows unexpected behavior and maybe even crashes. Sometimes
    we are not able to find the root cause of the problem just from the logs generated
    and collected, so we might need to troubleshoot the component on the cluster node
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We may be tempted to SSH into the given cluster node and run some diagnostic
    tools. But this is not possible since the cluster node only runs a minimal Linux
    distro with no such tools installed. As a developer, we could now just ask the
    cluster administrator to install all the Linux diagnostic tools we intend to use.
    But that is not a good idea. First of all, this would open the door for potentially
    vulnerable software now residing on the cluster node, endangering all the other
    pods that run on that node, and also open a door to the cluster itself that could
    be exploited by hackers. Furthermore, it is always a bad idea to give developers
    direct access to nodes of a production cluster, no matter how much you trust your
    developers. Only a limited number of cluster administrators should ever be able
    to do so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A better solution is to have the cluster admin run a so-called bastion container
    on behalf of the developers. This bastion or troubleshoot container has all the
    tools installed that we need to pinpoint the root cause of the bug in the application
    service. It is also possible to run the bastion container in the host's network
    namespace; thus, it will have full access to all the network traffic of the container
    host.

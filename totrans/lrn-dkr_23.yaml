- en: A Docker container is to IT what a shipping container is to the transportation
    industry. It defines a standard on how to package goods. In this case, goods are the
    application(s) developers write. The suppliers (in this case, the developers) are
    responsible for packaging the goods into the container and making sure everything
    fits as expected. Once the goods are packaged into a container, it can be shipped.
    Since it is a standard container, the shippers can standardize their means of
    transportation, such as lorries, trains, or ships. The shipper doesn't really care
    what's in a container. Also, the loading and unloading process from one transportation
    means to another (for example, train to ship) can be highly standardized. This
    massively increases the efficiency of transportation. Analogous to this is an
    operations engineer in IT, who can take a software container built by a developer
    and ship it to a production system and run it there in a highly standardized way,
    without worrying about what's in the container. It will just work.

- en: In a distributed application architecture, every piece of the software and infrastructure
    needs to be redundant in a production environment, where the continuous uptime
    of the application is mission-critical. A highly distributed application consists
    of many parts and the likelihood of one of the pieces failing or misbehaving increases
    with the number of parts. It is guaranteed that, given enough time, every part
    will eventually fail. To avoid outages of the application, we need redundancy
    in every part, be it a server, a network switch, or a service running on a cluster
    node in a container.

    of the application can move around due to scaling needs or due to component failures.
    Thus, we cannot hardwire different services with each other. Service A, which
    needs access to Service B, should not have to know details such as the IP address
    of Service B. It should rely on an external provider of this information. DNS
    is such a provider of location information. Service A just tells it that it wants
    to talk to Service B and the DNS service will figure out the details.

    distributed application is failing or misbehaving. Similar to a circuit breaker
    in electric wiring, a software-driven circuit breaker cuts the communication between
    a client and a failed service. The circuit breaker will directly report an error
    back to the client component if the failed service is called. This gives the system
    the opportunity to recover or heal from failure.

    since it consists of a single deployment package. On the other hand, a monolith
    is harder to scale to account for increased demand. In a distributed application,
    each service can be scaled individually and each service can run on optimized
    infrastructure, while a monolith needs to run on infrastructure that is OK for
    all or most of the features implemented in it. Maintaining and updating a monolith
    is much harder than a multi-service application, where each service can be updated
    and deployed independently. The monolith is often a big, complex, and tightly
    coupled pile of code. Minor modifications can have unexpected side effects. (Micro-)
    Services, on the other hand, are self-contained, simple components that behave
    like black boxes. Dependent services know nothing about the inner workings of
    the service and thus do not depend on it.

    downtime deployments of new versions of an application or an application service.
    If, say, Service A needs to be updated with a new version, then we call the currently
    running version blue. The new version of the service is deployed into production,
    but not yet wired up with the rest of the application. This new version is called
    green. Once the deployment succeeds and smoke tests have shown it's ready to go,
    the router that funnels traffic to blue is reconfigured to switch to green. The
    behavior of green is observed for a while and if everything is OK, blue is decommissioned.
    On the other hand, if green causes difficulties, the router can simply be switched
    back to blue and green can be fixed and later redeployed.

- en: Zero-downtime deployment means that a new version of a service in a distributed
    application is updated to a new version without the application needing to stop
    working. Usually, with Docker SwarmKit or Kubernetes (as we will see), this is
    done in a rolling fashion. A service consists of multiple instances and those
    are updated in batches so that the majority of the instances are up and running
    at all times.

- en: Containers are self-contained units of deployment. If a new version of a service
    is deployed and does not work as expected, we (or the system) need to only roll
    back to the previous version. The previous version of the service is also deployed
    in the form of self-contained containers. Conceptually, there is no difference
    in rolling forward (update) or backward (rollback). One version of a container
    is replaced by another one. The host itself is not affected by such changes in
    any way.

    and containers that use the secrets. Secrets are transferred encrypted due to
    the fact that the communication between swarm nodes uses mutual TLS. Secrets are

- en: This is a bad idea since all containers of a pod are co-located, which means
    they run on the same cluster node. Also, if multiple containers run in the same
    pod, they can only be scaled up or down all at once. However, the different components
    of the application (that is, `web`, `inventory`, and `db`) usually have very different
    requirements with regard to scalability or resource consumption. The `web` component
    might need to be scaled up and down depending on the traffic and the `db` component,
    in turn, has special requirements regarding storage that the others don't have.
    If we do run every component in its own pod, we are much more flexible in this
    regard.

- en: We cannot do any live debugging on a production system for performance and security
    reasons. This includes interactive or remote debugging. Yet application services
    can show unexpected behavior to code defects or other infrastructure-related issues
    such as network glitches or external services that are not available. To quickly
    pinpoint the reason for the misbehavior or failure of a service, we need as much
    logging information as possible. This information should give us a clue about,
    and guide us to, the root cause of the error. When we instrument a service, we
    do exactly this — we produce as much information as reasonable in the form of
    log entries and published metrics.

    sending data. Prometheus also defines the format in which the metrics are to be

    to keep its attack surface as limited as possible and to not waste precious resources.
    Thus we cannot assume that the tools typically used to troubleshoot applications
    or processes are available on the respective host. A powerful and recommended
    way to troubleshoot is to run a special tools or troubleshoot container as part
    of an ad hoc pod. This container can then be used as a bastion from which we can
    investigate network and other issues with the troubled service. A container that
    has been successfully used by many Docker field engineers at their customers site is `netshoot`.

    run all test functions. This may be undesirable, especially if you have a large
    number of tests in your package. A simple way to skip the test functions during

    functions, as shown in the following:'

    times, while the final benchmark function iterated 5 million times. The last column
    of the report shows the average time it takes to execute the tested function.
    For instance, the 5 million calls to the `Scale` method executed in benchmark
    function `BenchmarkVectorScale` took on average 266 nanoseconds to complete.

    the previous benchmark tests use the same size input. Sometimes it is useful to

    the performance profile of the equality method as we change the size of the input,
    say, from 3, 10, 20, or 30 elements. If the algorithm is sensitive size, expanding
    the benchmark using such attributes will reveal any bottlenecks.

    in Go. It discussed several key topics, including the use of the `go test` tool
    to compile and execute automated tests. Readers learned how to write test functions
    to ensure their code is properly tested and covered. The chapter also discussed
    the topic of testing HTTP clients and servers. Finally, the chapter introduced
    the topic of benchmarking as a way to automate, analyze, and measure code performance
    using built-in Go tools.

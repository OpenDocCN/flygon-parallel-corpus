- en: Thank you for purchasing this book. We hope that through the examples and projects
    in this book, you'll move from being a Go web development neophyte to someone
    who's able to take on serious projects intended for production. As such, this
    book tackles a lot of web development topics at a relatively high level. By the
    end of the book, you should be able to implement a very simple blog that accommodates
    display, authentication, and commenting with an eye towards performance and security.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Go excels at cross-platform compatibility, so any modern computers running a
    standard Linux flavor, OS X or Windows should be enough to get started. You can
    find a full list of requirements at [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
    In this book, we are working with a minimum of Go 1.5, but any newer release should
    be fine.

    leveraging it as a package manager to install applications to Kubernetes. Using
    Helm in this fashion did not require any Kubernetes expertise or any deep understanding
    of the application since all of the resources and logic were included as part
    of a Helm chart. The only concept you needed to be familiar with were the values
    that the chart provided in order to customize your installation.

    templates are defined under the `templates/` directory and are files that begin

    The `template` action is used to simply display data inline. Because of this limitation,
    chart developers should use the `include` function over the `template` action
    since `include` has feature parity with `template` but also provides the additional
    benefit of pipeline processing.

    applications to Kubernetes. This is the most common type of chart and is the default
    setting. However, charts can also be defined as library charts. This type of chart
    is not used to deploy applications but instead to provide named templates that
    may be used across multiple different charts. An example of this use case is the
    `labels` example defined in the previous section. Developers can maintain multiple
    different charts whose resources have the same labels. Rather than defining the
    same named templates in each chart's `_helpers.tpl` file, developers can declare
    a library chart that provides the named template for generating resource labels

    the ability to manage complex applications on Kubernetes. A release undergoes
    multiple phases during its life span. To provide additional management capabilities
    around the life cycle of a release, Helm features a `hooks` mechanism so that
    actions can be undertaken at different points in time within a release cycle.
    In this section, we will explore the different phases of a release's life span

    life span of a release. A hook, as with the majority of the features within Helm,
    is implemented as yet another Kubernetes resource and, more specifically, within
    a container. While the majority of workloads within Kubernetes are designed to
    long-living processes, such as an application serving API requests, workloads
    can also be made up of a single task or set of tasks executed using a script that
    indicates either success or failure once completed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two options that are typically used in a Kubernetes environment to create short-lived
    tasks are to make use of either a bare **pod** or a **job**. A bare pod is a pod
    that runs until completion and then terminates, but will not be rescheduled if
    the underlying node fails. For this reason, it may be preferred to run life cycle
    hooks as jobs, which reschedules the hook if the node fails or becomes unavailable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since hooks are simply defined as Kubernetes resources, they are also placed
    in the `templates/` folder and annotated with the helm.sh/hook annotation. The
    designation of this annotation ensures they are not rendered with the rest of
    the resources that are applied to a Kubernetes environment during standard processing.
    Instead, they are rendered and applied based on the value specified within the
    helm.sh/hook annotation, which determines when it should be executed within Kubernetes
    as part of the Helm release life cycle.

    this type of hook is to tie into an auditing system that tracks the installation
    of applications to a Kubernetes environment. A similar hook can be added after
    the installation completes to track the total time it took to complete the chart
    installation process.

    ordered alphabetically by name. However, you can define the order by specifying
    the weight of each hook using the `helm.sh/weight` annotation. Weights are sorted

    logic of sorting alphabetically by name is used.

    a certain file structure. The `Chart.yaml` file is used to set chart metadata

    YAML resources that are Go-templated, allowing them to be dynamically generated.
    Kubernetes resources defined under the `templates/` directory can also contain
    certain hooks to configure stages in an application's life cycle. To provide documentation
    to users, charts can contain the `README.md` and `templates/NOTES.txt` files and
    can also contain the `LICENSE` file to declare chart usage and distribution rights.
    Finally, charts can contain a `.helmignore` file, which is used to omit declared

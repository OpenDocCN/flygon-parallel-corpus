    the required software to develop Ionic apps, and finally scaffold a few apps and
    explore them.

- en: Before we start working with Ionic, we need to understand the bigger picture
    of Mobile Hybrid development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept is pretty simple. Almost every mobile operating system (also called
    platform, when working with Cordova) has an API to develop apps. This API consists
    of a component named WebView. A WebView is typically a browser that runs inside
    the scope of a mobile application. This browser runs the HTML, CSS, and JS code.
    This means that we can build a web page using the preceding technologies and then
    execute it inside our app.
  prefs: []

    apps (here, native refers to installing the platform-specific format file on the
    device after it has been packaged along with the assets), for instance:'

- en: The package/installer consists of a piece of native code that initializes the
    web page and a bunch of assets needed to show the web page content.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This setup of showing a web page inside the mobile app container that consists
    of our application business logic is called a Hybrid App.

- en: What is Apache Cordova?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In simple terms, Cordova is the piece of software that stitches the web application
    and the native application together. The Apache Cordova website states that:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile apps using HTML, CSS
    and JavaScript."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apache Cordova does not just stitch the web app with the native app--but it
    also provides a set of APIs written in JavaScript to interact with the native
    features of the device. Yes, we can use JavaScript to access our camera, take
    a picture, and send it in an e-mail. Sounds exciting, right?
  prefs: []

    following screenshot:'

- en: '![](img/00018.jpeg)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: As we can see, we have a WebView where the HTML/CSS/JS code gets executed. This
    code can be a simple standalone piece of user interface; at best we are making
    an AJAX request to get some data from a remote server. Or, this code can do much
    more, such as talk to the Bluetooth of the device and get the list of devices
    in the vicinity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In the latter case, Cordova has a bunch of APIs that interface with the WebView
    using JavaScript and then talk to the device in its native language (for example,
    Java for Android), thus providing a bridge between Java and JavaScript in this
    scenario. For instance, if we would like to know more about the device, which
    is running our app, all we need to do is write the following code inside the JS
    file and launch the app:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preceding explanation was to give you an idea of how Mobile Hybrid apps
    are structured and how we can use device features from the WebView using JavaScript.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cordova does not convert the HTML, CSS, and JS code to an OS-specific binary
    code. All it does is wrap the HTML, CSS, and JS code and execute it inside a WebView.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you must have guessed by now that Ionic is the framework with which we build
    the HTML/CSS/JS code that runs in the WebView and talks with Cordova to access
    device-specific APIs.

- en: What is Ionic 2?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ionic 2 is a beautiful, open source, frontend SDK for developing Hybrid Mobile
    apps with HTML5\. Ionic provides mobile-optimized HTML, CSS, and JS components,
    as well as gestures and tools for building highly interactive apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ionic 2 is performance efficient with its minimal DOM manipulation and hardware-accelerated
    transitions as compared to other frameworks in this league. Ionic uses Angular
    2 as its JavaScript framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the power of Angular inside a framework like Ionic 2, the possibilities
    are unlimited (we can use any Angular component inside Ionic as long as it makes
    sense in a mobile app). Ionic 2 has a very good integration with Cordova's device
    API. This means that we can access device APIs using Ionic Native and integrate
    it with the beautiful user interface components of Ionic.

    (widgets) specification ([http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/)),
    and it is extended to specify core Cordova API features, plugins, and platform-specific
    settings. There are two types of configurations that we can add to this file.
    One is global, that is, common to all devices, and the other is specific to the
    platform.

- en: In this chapter, we gained some knowledge on Mobile Hybrid architecture. We
    have also learned how a hybrid app works. We saw how Cordova stitches the HTML,
    CSS, and JS code to be executed inside the WebView of a native app. Then we installed
    the required software to develop Ionic apps locally. We scaffolded a blank template
    using the Ionic CLI and analyzed the project structure. Later on, we scaffolded
    the other two templates and observed the difference.

    the beginning of your exciting journey into designing and writing games. By the
    end of this book, we will have made four complete games: a math quiz with dynamically
    increasing difficulty, a memory game in the style of the classic Simon toy, a
    pong-style squash game, and a clone of the classic *Snake* game.'

    projects and still start with the very basics of Java.

    of learning this way is negated a hundred times over. If games don't interest
    you in the slightest, then there are plenty of Java beginners' guides out there
    that take the traditional approach. Just don't expect quite the same thrill as

    And will your significant time investment be wasted? On Android, as with most
    platforms, you can use many languages and tools. Android, however, was designed
    from the ground up to facilitate Java development. All other languages and tools
    are not invalid but tend to serve a fairly specific purpose, rather than be a
    real alternative to Java. In fact, as far as games are concerned, many of the
    alternatives to a pure Java development environment are also Java-based and require
    a good level of skill in Java to use. For example, the popular LibGDX game development
    library, which allows you to simultaneously make games for Android, iOS, Windows,
    Linux, Mac and even the Web, still uses Java! We will talk more about this in
    [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml "Chapter 9. Making Your Game the Next Big Thing"), *Making
    Your Game the Next Big Thing*. The point is that Java and Android are tied together
    and will likely thrive together.

    in fact. Although what Java has been used for has evolved and diversified over
    more than two decades, the originally implemented strengths of the language itself
    remain the same today.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Java was designed to be platform- or computer-independent. This is achieved
    by the use of a **virtual machine** (**VM**). This is a program written in another
    language that decodes the Java program that we write and interacts with the computer
    platform it is running on. So as long as there is a VM for the computer you want
    to run your Java program on, with a few caveats, your Java program will work.
    So if you learn Java, you are learning a language that is used everywhere from
    the smart fridge to the Web and most places in between.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is true, however, that the VM on each platform can and usually does implement
    features to specifically suit the uses it is likely to be put to. A clear example
    of this would be mobile-device-specific features such as sensors, GPS, or the
    built-in camera on many Android devices. Using Java with Android, you can take
    photos, detect the air pressure, and work out exactly where in the world you are.
    Most fridge VMs probably will not do this. So you can't always just run a Java
    program designed for device x on device y, but the language and syntax is the
    same. Learning Java on Android prepares you in a large part for Java in any situation.
    So rest assured that Java isn't going away any time soon.

    language is the best to learn programming. Critics of Java will likely say things
    about Java's speed. It is true that the Java memory management along with the
    VM interpretation process does have some speed cost. However, these things have
    benefits; they significantly improve our productivity and the way that the Android
    VM interacts with a device largely negates the minor speed penalty. And since
    Android 4.4, it does so completely with **Android Run Time** (**ART**), which
    installs apps written in Java as fully native applications. Now Java programmers
    can build games in a friendly, interpreted language and have them run as if they
    were written in a more challenging natively compiled language.

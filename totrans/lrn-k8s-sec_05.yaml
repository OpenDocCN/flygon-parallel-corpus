- en: The principle of least privilege states that each component of an ecosystem
    should have minimal access to data and resources for it to function. In a multitenant
    environment, multiple resources can be accessed by different users or objects.
    The principle of least privilege ensures that damage to the cluster is minimal
    if users or objects misbehave in such environments.

    the complexity of Kubernetes, we will first look into the Kubernetes subjects,
    and then the privileges available for the subjects. Then, we will talk about the
    privileges of Kubernetes objects and possible ways to restrict them. The goal
    of this chapter is to help you understand a few critical concepts, such as the
    principle of least privilege and **Role-Based Access Control** (**RBAC**). In
    this chapter, we will talk about different Kubernetes objects, such as namespaces,
    service accounts, Roles, and RoleBindings, and Kubernetes security features, such
    as the security context, the PodSecurityPolicy, and the NetworkPolicy, which can
    be leveraged to implement the principle of least privilege for your Kubernetes
    cluster.

- en: Privilege is the authority to perform an action such as accessing a resource
    or processing some data. The principle of least privilege is the idea that any
    subject, user, program, process, and so on should only have the minimum required
    privileges to perform its function. For example, Alice, a regular Linux user,
    is able to create a file under her own home directory. In other words, Alice at
    least has the privilege or permission to create a file under her home directory.
    However, Alice may not be able to create a file under another user's directory
    because she doesn't have the privilege or permission to do so. If none of Alice's
    daily tasks actually exercises the privilege to create a file in the home directory,
    but she does have the privilege to do so, then the administrator for the machine
    is not complying with the principle of least privilege. In this section, we will
    first introduce the concept of the authorization model from which the concept
    of least privilege derived, and then, we will talk about the benefits of implementing
    the principle of least privilege.

    may have different privileges to operate Kubernetes objects. For example, users
    in the `system:master` group have the `cluster-admin` role granted, meaning they

    node has. A container with a crypto-mining binary running may easily consume the
    CPU resources on the node shared by other pods. It's always a good practice to
    set resource requests and limits for workload. The resource request impacts which
    node the pods will be assigned to by the scheduler, while the resource limit sets
    the condition under which the container will be terminated. It's always safe to
    assign more resource requests and limits to your workload to avoid eviction or
    termination. However, do keep in mind that if you set the resource request or
    limit too high, you've caused a resource waste on your cluster, and the resources

    stack, process, and **Interprocess Communication** (**IPC**) at the host level.
    But do you really need to grant host-level namespace access or set privileged
    mode to your pods or containers? Also, if you know which Linux capabilities are
    required for your processes in the container, you'd better drop those unnecessary
    ones. And how much memory and CPU is sufficient for your workload to be fully
    functional? Please do think through these questions for the purpose of implementing
    the principle of least privilege for your Kubernetes workload. Properly set resource
    requests and limits, use security context for your workload, and enforce a PodSecurityPolicy
    for your cluster. All of this will help ensure the least privilege for your workload
    to access system resources.

    with other, and a pod may be able to communicate with the internet if there is
    no proxy rule or firewall rule configured outside the Kubernetes cluster. The
    openness of Kubernetes blurs the security boundary of microservices, and we mustn't
    overlook network resources such as API endpoints provided by other microservices
    that a container or pod can access.

    A**, as expected. Defining an egress rule in your network policy will help ensure

    we still need to bring your attention to the application resource level from a

    bringing up here. If there are applications that your workload accesses that support
    multiple users with different levels of privileges, it's better to examine whether
    the privileges granted to the user on your workload's behalf are necessary or
    not. For example, a user who is responsible for auditing does not need any write
    privileges. Application developers should keep this in mind when designing the
    application. This helps to ensure the least privilege for your workload to access
    application resources.

    It is worth emphasizing the importance of implementing the principle of the principle
    of least privilege holistically. If least privilege is missed in any area, this
    will potentially leave an attack surface wide open.'

    developers should work with security architects to design the minimum privileges

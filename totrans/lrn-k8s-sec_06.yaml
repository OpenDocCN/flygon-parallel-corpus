    the same security concerns and access levels, whereas a trust boundary is a dividing
    line where program execution and data change the level of trust. Controls in the
    security boundary ensure that execution moving between boundaries does not elevate
    the trust level without appropriate validation. As data or execution moves between
    security boundaries without appropriate controls, security vulnerabilities show
    up.

- en: Security boundaries exist in the data layer, the network layer, and the system
    layer. Security boundaries depend on the technologies used by the IT department
    or infrastructure team. For example, companies use virtual machines to manage
    their applications – a hypervisor is the security boundary for virtual machines.
    Hypervisors ensure that code running in a virtual machine does not escape from
    the virtual machine or affect the physical node. When companies start embracing
    microservices and use orchestrators to manage their applications, containers are
    one of the security boundaries. However, compared to hypervisors, containers do
    not provide a strong security boundary, nor do they aim to. Containers enforce
    restrictions at the application layer but do not prevent attackers from bypassing
    these restrictions from the kernel layer.

    for applications. In a microservices architecture, Pods in Kubernetes can communicate
    with others. Network policies are used to restrict communication among Pods and
    Services.

    access to system or bin directories to only root or system users is a simple example
    of security boundaries at the data layer. In containerized environments, chroot
    prevents containers from tampering with the filesystems of other containers. Kubernetes
    restructures the application deployment in a way that strong security boundaries
    can be enforced on both the network and system layers.

- en: Security boundary and trust boundary are often used as synonyms. Although similar,
    there is a subtle difference between these two terms. A **trust boundary** is
    where a system changes its level of trust. An execution trust boundary is where
    instructions need different privileges to run. For example, a database server
    executing code in `/bin` is an example of an execution crossing a trust boundary.
    Similarly, a data trust boundary is where data moves between entities with different
    trust levels. Data inserted by an end user into a trusted database is an example
    of data crossing a trust boundary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whereas a **security boundary** is a point of demarcation between different
    security domains, a security domain is a set of entities that are within the same
    access level. For example, in traditional web architecture, the user-facing applications
    are part of a security domain and the internal network is part of a different
    security domain. Security boundaries have access controls associated with it.
    Think of trust boundary as a wall and security boundary as a fence around the
    wall.

    It helps ensure appropriate validation is done for instructions and data before
    it crosses the boundaries. In Kubernetes, components and objects span across different
    security boundaries. It is important to understand these boundaries to put risk
    mitigation plans in place when an attacker crosses a security boundary. CVE-2018-1002105
    is a prime example of an attack caused by missing validation across trust boundaries;
    proxy request handling in the API server allowed an unauthenticated user to get
    admin privileges to the cluster. Similarly, CVE-2018-18264 allows users to skip
    the authentication process on the dashboard to allow unauthenticated users to
    access sensitive cluster information.

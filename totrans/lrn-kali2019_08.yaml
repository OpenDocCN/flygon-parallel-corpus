- en: Active information gathering can be used to provide very useful results during
    the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test. With this active approach, the
    penetration tester makes a direct connection to the actual target to gather specific
    details that **Open Source Intelligence** (**OSINT**) is unable to provide. Using
    active information gathering, the penetration tester is able to create a very
    detailed profile of the target, gathering information such as the type of operating
    system and running services. This information helps to research and identify vulnerabilities
    in relation to the target, thereby narrowing the scope in choosing specific exploits
    to unleash against it.

    specific details about it in order to help us profile any running services. Understanding
    how to perform active reconnaissance will provide us with vital assistance for
    the exploitation phase. During the information-gathering phase, you'll be able
    to identify vulnerabilities and determine suitable exploits to break into a system
    and network. You will also be able to retrieve sensitive information from network
    devices and systems.

- en: Active information gathering uses a direct approach to engage with our target;
    it involves actually making a connection between our machine and the target network
    and systems. By performing active information gathering, we are able to gather
    specific and detailed data such as live hosts, running services and application
    versions, network file shares, and user account information.

  prefs: []

- en: Determining live hosts will give us an idea of the number of devices that are
    online. It doesn't make sense to target an offline device as it would be unresponsive.
    Knowing the operating system and running services on a target helps us to understand
    the role of that device in the network and the resources it provides to its clients.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if we were to find lots of file shares on the target system during
    active information gathering, this could mean that the target may be a file server
    that has a lot of important data on its shared drive. When performing active information
    gathering, the attacker machine (in our case, a Kali Linux-based machine) sends
    special queries to the potential victim in the hope that the victim machine will
    respond by providing some sort of confidential information (such as network shares
    and service versions) in return.

    applications and network protocols is very important. In this section, we are
    going to focus on a particular protocol: **Domain Name System** (**DNS**).'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DNS is like a telephone directory containing names, addresses, and telephone
    numbers. DNS is used on networks—both the internal networks of organizations and
    external networks across the internet. The DNS protocol is used to resolve hostnames
    (domain names) to IP addresses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before DNS, each computer contained a `hosts` file located in the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
    directory. This file needed to be updated frequently to ensure that users were
    able to reach various websites or servers by specifying their hostnames or domain
    names. If the `hosts` file was not present, a user needed to specify the IP address
    of the server they would like to visit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All devices on a network have an assigned IP address. Remembering all of the
    IP addresses for each server or website you want to visit would be quite challenging.
    If the `hosts` file doesn't contain the most up-to-date records of new servers
    and websites, the user would have difficulty in reaching their destination.

    to prevent the copying of zone files to unauthorized servers. A successful DNS
    zone transfer can lead to a penetration tester obtaining the corporate network

    host to determine whether the target is alive. If the target does not respond,
    Nmap will not attempt to execute the scan. However, system administration and
    cybersecurity professionals usually disable **Internet Control Message Protocol**
    (**ICMP**) responses on servers. Not receiving an ICMP echo reply from a target
    would indicate that the target device is down/offline; however, this technique
    sets out to basically trick a novice hacker into thinking the host is simply not
    available. Using the `–Pn` operator during an Nmap scan will skip the host discovery
    phase and treat the target as online.

    until a valid user is found. However, such attacks are considered noisy rather
    than stealthy (quiet). As a comparison, imagine you are playing an online first-person
    shooter game, and your task is to invade the enemy base and steal a trophy without
    alerting the guards. If you are not careful enough and make any loud noises, the
    guards will be alerted and the mission will fail. In this analogy, the guards
    are the security controls, and the sensors are the firewalls, IDS/IPS, and anti-malware
    protection. Hence, this technique is not quiet on a network; however, this method
    can still get you access to a system, provided that the security controls do not
    perform a lockout action before you can gain access.

- en: A lot of times, when a user enters an incorrect username on a login portal,
    an error message is returned, usually stating that an incorrect username has been
    entered. This clearly tells an attacker that the username provided does not exist
    in the database. Additionally, if the incorrect password was entered, the system
    usually returns a message stating that an incorrect password was entered for the
    username. So, from an attacker's point of view, the system is telling us that
    the username exists in the database, but we have not provided the correct password
    for it.

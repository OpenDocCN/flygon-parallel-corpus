- en: Gaining access to a system and network is one of the most critical phases during
    a penetration test. This phase tests both the penetration tester's skill set and
    the security controls of the target system and network. The penetration tester
    must always think about all the possible ways in which they can break into the
    target by exploiting various security flaws.

    any sort of network penetration and exfiltrate data. The purpose of a penetration
    test is to simulate real-world attacks that a real hacker with malicious intent
    would perform. This means gaining unauthorized entry to a corporate network and
    compromising systems.

    excited to hack another system, whether it's a computer or even a wireless network.
    The previous chapters focused on gathering enough intelligence on a target prior
    to launching an attack. The exploitation phase of hacking and penetration testing
    can sometimes be challenging.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's very important to gather as many details as possible about the target.
    Such background work helps us to determine approximate exploits and a payload
    we can launch against a target system or network. Sometimes, when you launch an
    exploit that's intended for a particular operating system, it may not work, and
    this can be frustrating. One tactic you can adopt is to target the low-hanging
    fruits on a network—that is, attempt to exploit and gain access to systems and
    devices that seem easier and vulnerable to TCP/IP protocols that can be easily
    exploited.
  prefs: []

- en: An example is the **vsftpd** service, which we explored in the previous chapters
    and used to gain entry to the target via a shell interface. Another example is
    the **EternalBlue** vulnerability, which is found on the Windows operating system.
    During your scanning phase, be sure to perform an extensive vulnerability assessment
    on all the devices on your target network.

    easy to exploit, and then move on to those that are less vulnerable and thus more
    difficult to exploit. To put this into context, imagine appearing for a written
    examination. The question paper has a lot of challenging questions that need to
    be answered within a given time period. In such a scenario, it's always wise to
    answer easier questions first and then move on to the tougher ones. This will
    give you more time to answer questions that you are more likely to get correct
    and maximize the marks that you will score in the exam.

    types of attack that will assist them in gaining entry to a network. Usually,
    you start by performing online or offline password cracking. Once you've obtained
    a valid username and password, the next step is to access the victim's system
    and escalate your user privileges. Obtaining a higher level of user privilege
    will allow for the execution of any application and tasks on the compromised machine.
    Hiding files such as malicious code is designed to ensure that a hidden backdoor
    is created and that logic bombs (a type of virus that contains a set of instructions
    triggered by a user's action) have been planted. Lastly, when disconnecting from
    a compromised machine, it's always wise to cover your tracks. Covering your tracks
    is the last phase in penetration testing and focuses on removing any log files
    and evidence indicating that an attacker was present on the system or network.

    as a laptop are able to connect to a wireless access point. This will let them
    access the resources on the local network, just like they would when connected
    physically using a wire. Wireless networking provides a lot of convenience to
    a user, whether at home or in a corporate environment.

    smartphone to establish a connection. This creates a concern about user privacy
    and security. The WEP encryption standard was used in the early generations of
    wireless networking and is still implemented by users at home and by IT administrators.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The WEP encryption standard uses the **Rivest Cipher 4** (**RC4**) encryption
    cipher, which uses a **40-bit key** for data encryption. When it was developed,
    this was considered very secure, but, by 2002, multiple security weaknesses had
    been found in the standard. An attacker would be able to obtain the encryption
    key within a few hours. Using the 40-bit key, an attacker could capture and decrypt
    traffic very quickly, which compromised the confidentiality of the WEP encryption
    standard. In modern cryptographic standards, a larger encryption key is used to
    prevent such attacks on data encryption.

    identifier** (**SSID**) is usually that of the manufacturer. For example, the
    default SSID (wireless network name) for a new Linksys access point would contain
    the name `Linksys` as its SSID. Many manufacturers do this to help the user quickly
    identify their wireless network when setting up a new access point. However, many
    individuals and organizations use the default SSID.

    a new Linksys access point for your home or organization, and, during the setup

    word `Linksys` would be part of the network name. As a penetration tester who

    you to specify a list of permitted and restricted devices that can, and cannot,

    covered in the previous chapter, that allow a penetration tester to capture a
    list of authorized devices (their MAC addresses) and perform spoofing to gain

- en: NAC is a system that's designed to control access and ensure compliance. It
    uses a set of processes and technologies that are focused on controlling who and
    what is able to access a network and its resources. NAC does this by authorizing
    devices that have a level of compliance to operate on a corporate network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once a device is connected, the NAC server is able to profile and check whether
    the connected device has met the standard of compliance before allowing access
    to the network resources, security policies, and controls, which are configured
    to ensure that there is some form of restriction that prevents non-compliant devices
    from obtaining network access.

    **authentication, authorization, and accounting** (**AAA**) services on a network.
    This is where user accounts are created and stored, and where privileges and policies
    are applied. The authentication server runs either **Remote Authentication Dial-In
    User Service** (**RADIUS**) or **Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System
    Plus** (**TACACS+**) as its protocol.'

    laptop computer, that wants to access the network. The supplicant connects to
    the network (wired or wireless) and is prompted with an authentication login window
    provided by the authenticator. When the user submits their user credentials, the
    authenticator queries the authentication server to verify the user and determine
    what policies and privileges to apply while the user is logged on to the network.'

    chapter and the previous chapter, we took a look at how to gather user credentials
    and spoof the identity of our attacker machine (Kali Linux). Using the MAC address
    and user credentials of a valid user on a target network will provide you with
    some sort of access to the secure network.

    protection on all connected devices. If your system does not satisfy compliance
    requirements, this can trigger a red flag or not allow access based on policies.

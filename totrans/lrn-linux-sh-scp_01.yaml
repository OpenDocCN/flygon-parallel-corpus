    two most relevant components: **Linux** and **Bash**. We''ll give an explanation
    of Linux and Bash, look into the history behind the two technologies, and discuss
    the current state of both.'

- en: Linux is a generic term that refers to different open source operating systems
    that are based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel was originally created by
    Linus Torvalds in 1991, and open sourced in 1996\. A kernel is a piece of software
    that is designed to act as an intermediate layer between low-level hardware (such
    as the processor, memory, and input/output devices) and high-level software, such
    as an operating system. Apart from the Linux kernel, most Linux operating systems
    rely heavily on GNU project utilities; for example, the Bash shell is a GNU program.
    Because of this, Linux operating systems are referred to by some as GNU/Linux.
    The GNU project, where GNU stands for ***G**NU's **N**ot **U**nix!* (a recursive
    acronym), is a collection of free software, a lot of which is found in most Linux
    distributions. This collection includes many tools, but also an alternative kernel
    called GNU HURD (which is not as widespread as the Linux kernel).

    system, it provides an abstraction for interacting with hardware. This is why
    the Linux ecosystem has grown so large: the kernel can be used freely, and it
    handles a lot of low-level operations on many types of hardware. Creators of an
    operating system can therefore spend their time making an easy-to-use, beautiful
    experience for their users, instead of having to worry about how the users'' pictures
    are going to be written to the physical disk(s) attached to the system.'

    this implies that it is similar to the original Unix kernel, which was created
    between 1971 and 1973 at Bell Labs, by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. However,
    the Linux kernel is only *based on* Unix principles and does not *share code*
    with Unix systems. Famous Unix systems include the BSDs (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and
    so on) and macOS.

    or as a server. As a desktop, Linux can serve as a replacement for the more commonly
    used Microsoft Windows or macOS. However, most Linux usage is accounted for the
    server landscape. At the time of writing, it is estimated that around 70% of all
    servers on the internet use a Unix or Unix-like operating system. The next time
    you''re browsing the news, reading your mail, or are scrolling through your favorite
    social media website, remember that there''s a big chance the pages you are being
    shown have been processed by one or more Linux servers.'

- en: There are many distributions, or flavors, of Linux. Most Linux operating systems
    fall within distribution families. A distribution family is based on a common
    ancestor, and often use the same package management tools. One of the more well-known
    Linux distributions, **Ubuntu**, is based on the **Debian** distribution family.
    Another prominent Linux distribution, **Fedora**, is based on the **Red Hat**
    family. Other notable distribution families include **SUSE**, **Gentoo**, and
    **Arch**.

    the most common smartphone operating system in use today, Android (with a market
    share of around 85%), uses a modified version of the Linux kernel. The same goes
    for many smart TVs, routers, modems, and various other (embedded) devices. If
    we were to include Unix and other Unix-like software, we can safely say that most
    of the devices in the world run on these kernels!

- en: The most commonly used shell in Linux systems is the **B**ourne-**a**gain **sh**ell,
    or Bash. The Bash shell is based on the **Bourne shell**, known as **sh**. But
    what is a shell?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A shell is, in essence, a user interface. Most often, it is used to refer to
    a text-based interface, also called a **command-line interface** (**CLI**). However,
    it is called a *shell* because it can be seen as a *shell around the kernel*;
    this means that it applies not just to CLIs, but just as well to **graphical user
    interfaces** (**GUIs**). When we refer to a shell in this book, we are talking
    about a CLI, and unless stating differently, we're talking about the Bash shell.

- en: 'The purpose of a shell, both CLI and GUI, is to allow the user to interact
    with the system. After all, a system that does not offer interaction would be
    hard to justify, not too mention hard to use! Interaction in this context means
    many things: typing on your keyboard will make letters appear on your screen,
    moving your mouse will change the location of the cursor on screen, giving the
    command to delete a file (either with a CLI or GUI) will remove the bytes from
    the disk, and so on.'

- en: 'In the earliest days of Unix and computers, no GUIs were available, so all
    work was performed via a CLI. To connect to the shell on a running machine, a
    **video terminal** was used: often this would be a very simple monitor combined
    with a keyboard, which was connected with, for example, a RS-232 serial cable.
    Commands entered on this video terminal were processed by the shell running on
    the Unix machine.'

    we no longer use dedicated hardware to connect to shells. A piece of software
    running in a GUI, a **terminal emulator**, is used for interaction with the shell.
    Lets take a quick look at how connecting to a Bash shell with a terminal emulator
    can look:'

    important functionality: the ability to execute multiple commands sequentially,
    with or without user interaction, tailored to a specific goal. This might sound

    kernel, what a kernel really is, and how big an impact Linux distributions have
    on daily life. You've also learned what a shell is, and that the most common Linux
    shell, Bash, can be both used to interact with a Linux system, and is also utilized
    to write shell scripts.

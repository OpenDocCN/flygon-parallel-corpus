    of Linux and Bash. Since this is a practical, exercise-driven book, we're going
    to use this chapter to set up a machine where you can follow along with the examples
    and perform the exercises at the end of each chapter. This can either be a virtual
    machine or a physical installation; that is up to you. We will discuss this in
    the first part of this chapter, before continuing with the installation of VirtualBox
    and, finally, creating an Ubuntu virtual machine.

- en: A virtual machine is an emulation of a physical machine. This means it runs
    *inside* a physical machine, as opposed to *directly* *on the hardware*. A physical
    machine has direct access to all hardware, such as the CPU, the RAM, and other
    devices such as the mouse, the keyboard, and the monitor. It is, however, impossible
    to share the CPU or the RAM between multiple physical machines. Virtual machines
    do not directly get access to hardware, but through an emulation layer, which
    means resources can be shared between multiple virtual machines.

    manages resources between the host machine and the virtual machines, provides

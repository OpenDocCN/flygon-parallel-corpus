  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A filesystem is, in essence, the way data is stored and retrieved on a physical
    medium (which can be a hard disk, solid state drive, or even RAM). It is a software
    implementation that manages where and how the bits are written and found again,
    and may include various advanced features which enhance reliability, performance,
    and functionality.

- en: 'The concept of a filesystem is abstract: there are many filesystem *implementations*,
    which are confusingly often referred to as filesystems. We find it easiest to
    grasp by ordering the filesystems in families, just as with Linux distributions:
    there are Linux filesystems, Windows filesystems, macOS filesystems, and many
    others. The Windows filesystem family spans from the earliest filesystem of **FAT**
    up until the newest **ReFS**, with the most widely used currently being **NTFS**.'

- en: The most commonly used Linux filesystem implementation is currently ext4\. It
    is the fourth iteration in the **extended file system** (**ext**) series of Linux
    filesystems. It was released in 2008 and is considered *very* stable, but it is
    not state-of-the-art; reliability is the most important consideration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: XFS is most famously used in Red Hat distributions (Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
    CentOS, and Fedora). It contains some features that are more advanced than ext4,
    such as parallel I/O, larger file size support, and better handling of large files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, there is Btrfs. This filesystem implementation was initially designed
    at Oracle and is considered stable as of 2014\. Btrfs has many advanced features
    that could make it preferable to ext4 and XFS; the principal developer of ext4
    even stated that ext4 should eventually be replaced by Btrfs. The most interesting
    feature of Btrfs is that it uses the **copy-on-write** (**COW**) principle: files
    that are copied aren''t actually written out to the physical medium fully, but
    only a new pointer to the same data is created. Only when either the copy or the
    original gets modified is new data written.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you might have guessed, a filesystem implementation is nothing more than
    software. For Linux, the three implementations previously described are present
    in all newer Linux kernels. This means that, as long as the correct drivers are
    installed in the operating system, these can all be used. Even better, all of
    these can even be used *concurrently*! We will discuss this further later in this
    chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another interesting thing to note is that, while ext4 is native to Linux, with
    the help of drivers it can be used under, for example, Windows as well. You would
    not use ext4 as the filesystem for the primary drive under Windows, but you could
    *mount* a Linux-formatted ext4 filesystem under Windows and interact with the
    contents. The other way around, mounting a Windows filesystem under Linux, is
    also supported for most implementations. And while we used ext4 as the example
    here, the same goes for XFS and Btrfs.

    the **Unix Filesystem Standard** (**UFS**).It specifies the **directory structure**

    (often) have very advanced features on the topic of file integrity and disaster
    recovery. An example of such a disaster would be a system experiencing a power
    outage when it was in the middle of writing a business-critical file. If the write
    operation was stored in memory and aborted halfway through, the file would be
    in an inconsistent state. When the system is brought up again, the operating system
    does not have the write operation in memory anymore (since memory is cleared on
    each reboot), and only a part of the file will be written. Obviously, this is
    unwanted behavior and can lead to problems. Because of the properties of COW,
    Btrfs does not have this problem. However, ext4 and XFS are not COW filesystems.
    They both handle this issue in another way: with **journaling**:'

    a reference to the *actual* location on disk (the drive sectors), it will overwrite
    what was previously written, in this case, part of the file. If it finished successfully
    this time, the journal entry will be removed and the state of the file/disk is
    guaranteed. Should the server fail between steps 1 and 2, the actual instruction
    to write to disk has never been given and the software giving the instruction
    should account for that possibility.

    use them (with the current value of `PATH`, which we can change, but that''s out
    of scope for now). That would mean that binaries we''ve been using up until now
    (`cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `echo`) would need to be in one of these directories so
    that we can use them, right? Unfortunately, this is where things get slightly
    complicated. On Linux, we basically use two types of binaries: those that are
    found on disk (in a directory as specified by the `PATH` variable), or they can
    be built into the shell we''re using, then called a *shell builtin*. A good example
    is actually the `echo` command we just learned, which is both! We can see what

    used. If it is only present as a built-in, such as `cd`, the built-in is used.
    As a general rule, most commands you use will be binaries on disk, as found in
    your `PATH`. Furthermore, most of these will be present in the `/usr/bin/` directory
    (on our Ubuntu virtual machine, more than half of the total binaries are present
    in `/usr/bin/`!).

    us with the tools we need to perform our work. The question remains, why are there
    (at least) six different directories, and why are they divided between `bin` and
    `sbin`? The answer to the last part of the question is easy: `bin` has normal
    utilities used by users, while `sbin` has utilities used by system administrators.
    In that last category, tools related to disk maintenance, network configuration,
    and firewalling, for example, are found. The `bin` directories contain utilities
    that are used for filesystem operations (such as creating and removing files/directories),
    archiving, and listing information about the system, among others.'

    more vague. In general, the rule is that essential tools are found in `/(s)bin`,
    while system-specific binaries are placed in the `/usr/(s)bin` directories. So
    if you installed a package to run a web server, it would be placed in either `/usr/bin/`
    or `/usr/sbin/`, since it is system-specific. Finally, the `/usr/local/(s)bin/`
    directories are, in our experience, most often used for binaries that are installed
    manually, instead of from a package manager. But you could place them in either
    directory of the `PATH` to work; it's mostly a matter of convention.

    recommend checking out the rest of the `/usr/` directory using `cd` and `ls`,

    the RAM, which means the contents of `/tmp/` do not survive a reboot. Since we're

    the FHS that Linux adheres to was explained in high level, before focusing on
    the more important parts of the Linux filesystem in detail. This was done by exploring
    parts of the tree structure that makes up the Linux filesystem. We explained that
    different filesystems can be used side by side, by mounting them somewhere inside

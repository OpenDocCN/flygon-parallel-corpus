    chapter. Next, we move on to the next phase of post exploitation, which is cleaning
    tracks and traces through log deletion and staying undetected by disabling the
    firewall and antivirus systems. In this chapter we will learn how to evade firewall
    and antivirus system alerts once a system is compromised. Another important matter
    for a hacker is how invisibly he performs his work. This is known as cleaning
    tracks and traces; here, a malicious hacker clears logs and any alerts that may
    have been created because of his intrusion.

- en: Why is a firewall important? A firewall is basically software or hardware that
    blocks unauthorized entry to a system or network. A firewall also keeps track
    of intrusions and security breaches. If the firewall is well-configured, each
    unauthorized entry is blocked and logged in the security logs. It controls the
    incoming and outgoing network traffic and analyzes the data packets; based on
    this, it decides whether it should allow the packet through the firewall or not.
    So if a malicious user is able to exploit a system remotely, the first step should
    be to disable the firewall so that no further alerts can be logged by the firewall,
    which could show evidence of the intrusion.

    as well, for the source and destination port numbers. When a packet travels towards
    the packet filter firewall, it is analyzed with the help of set rules to match
    against. If the packet passes through the filters of the firewall, it is allowed
    to enter the network, otherwise it is blocked.'

    user from using post-exploitation scripts and creating backdoors to compromised
    systems. Hence an attacker's first objective should be to disable the firewall
    once he compromises the system. In this chapter we will see how we can actually
    disable the firewall through Metasploit and then work on unauthorized zones.

- en: Let us take a look at some of the exploitation issues in an antivirus program.
    There are various things that an attacker needs to take care of after exploiting
    a system. This is important if he wants to play safe and stay undetected. Antivirus
    software is one of the main defense systems for a legitimate user, and if an attacker
    is able to disable it, he has successfully gained full control over the system
    and can stay undetected. Hence it is very important for an attacker to disable
    the antivirus system as a precautionary measure to hide his/her existence. In
    this chapter, we will learn how to disable and kill different antivirus programs
    through Meterpreter post-exploitation scripts.

    Since firewalls and antiviruses are the main defenses against the attack vectors
    of an attacker, it becomes extremely important for an attacker to pay heed to
    these things. We also came across multiple techniques for disabling a system firewall
    and hence the victim's defenses. We followed the approach of an attacker and were
    able to hack safely into the system by clearing our traces. So, until now, we
    have covered the second phase of post-exploitation, which is one of the most important
    phases in the exploitation process. In the next chapter we will cover the techniques
    of working with backdoors and setting them up on the victim's system for retaining
    permanent access.

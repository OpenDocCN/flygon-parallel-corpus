    could usually only run inside the browser, and they let it run on your machine
    as a standalone process. This means that we could create applications using JavaScript
    outside the context of the browser.

    they're both running on the exact same engine. It's called the V8 JavaScript runtime
    engine. It's an open source engine that takes JavaScript code and compiles it
    into much faster machine code. And that's a big part of what makes Node.js so
    fast.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Machine code is low-level code that your computer can run directly without needing
    to interpret it. Your machine only knows how to run certain types of code, for
    example, your machine can't run JavaScript code or PHP code directly without first
    converting it into low-level code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using this V8 engine, we can take our JavaScript code, compile it to much quicker
    machine code, and execute that. This is where all those new features come in.
    The V8 engine is written in a language called C++. So if you want to extend the
    Node language, you don't write Node code, you write C++ code that builds off of
    what V8 already has in place.
  prefs: []

    that your application does all of the time. When you're reading or writing to

    may be changing some files on your filesystem, or you may be making an HTTP request

    current location. All of these use I/O, and I/O takes time.

    six seconds. A difference of 50%. This 50% comes from the fact that in blocking,

    requests each taking three seconds, but they run at the same time.
  prefs: []

- en: Using the non-blocking model, we can still do stuff like printing the sum without
    having to wait for our database to respond. Now, this is the big difference between
    the two; blocking, everything happens in order, and in non-blocking we start events,
    attaching callbacks, and these callbacks get fired later. We're still printing
    out `user1` and `user2`, we're just doing it when the data comes back, because
    the data doesn't come back right away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inside Node.js, the event loop attaches a listener for the event to finish,
    in this case for that database to respond back. When it does, it calls the callback
    you pass in the non-blocking case, and then we print it to the screen.

- en: Now, imagine this was a web server instead of the preceding example. That would
    mean if a web server comes in looking to query the database, we can't process
    other users' requests without spinning up a separate thread. Now, Node.js is single
    threaded, which means your application runs on one single thread, but since we
    have non-blocking I/O, that's not a problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a blocking context, we could handle two requests on two separate threads,
    but that doesn't really scale well, because for each request we have to beef up
    the amount of CPU and RAM resources that we're using for the application, and
    this sucks because those threads, are still sitting idle. Just because we can
    spin up other threads doesn't mean we should, we're wasting resources that are
    doing nothing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the non-blocking case, instead of wasting resources by creating multiple
    threads, we're doing everything on one thread. When a request comes in, the I/O
    is non-blocking so we're not taking up any more resources than we would be if
    it never happened at all.

    our app doesn't do anything cool, we'll be using this process of creating folders/files

- en: In this chapter, we touched base with the concept of Node.js. We took a look
    at what Node is and we learned that it's built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine.
    Then we explored why Node has become so popular, its advantages and its disadvantages.
    We took a look at the different text editors we can choose from and, at the end,
    you created your very first Node application.

    In the previous chapter, we looked at the basic testing framework and worked on
    synchronous as well as asynchronous Node application. In this chapter we'll move
    on to testing the Express applications, then we'll look into a method to organize
    our test better in the result output, and last but not least we'll get into some
    advanced methods of testing Node application.

    assertions about it, whether it's headers, the status code, the body, or anything
    else. It is a real burden. That is not the goal for this section. Our goal here

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For our purposes, we need a spy so we can simulate that function inside of `app.js`
    (`saveUser`). We need a way to replace `saveUser` function with a `spy`. Then
    we can verify that when `handleSignup` gets called, it does indeed call `saveUser`.
    It doesn't need to actually go through the process over in `db.js`; this is not
    important to our tests. The only thing that is important is that the function
    was called with the correct arguments.
  prefs: []

- en: To do that, we'll look at an npm module called `rewire`, which lets us swap
    out variables for our tests. In our case, in our test file, we'll be able to replace
    the `db` object with something else completely. Then, when the code runs, instead
    of calling `db.saveUser` as defined in `app.js`, it will be calling `db.saveUser`,
    which will be a `spy`.

    we have to load it in in a special way. We''ll make a variable called `app`, and

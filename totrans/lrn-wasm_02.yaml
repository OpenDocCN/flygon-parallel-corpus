- en: The `WebAssembly.Memory` object holds the memory accessed by a WebAssembly `Instance`.
    This memory can be accessed and changed from both JavaScript and WebAssembly.
    To create a new instance of `Memory`, you need to pass an object with an `initial`
    and (optional) `maximum` value to the `WebAssembly.Memory()` constructor. These
    values are in units of WebAssembly pages, where one page is 64 KB. You increase
    the size of the memory instance by calling the `grow()` function with a single
    parameter that represents the number of WebAssembly pages to grow by. You can
    also access the current buffer contained in the memory instance through its `buffer`
    property.

- en: MDN describes two ways to get to a `WebAssembly.Memory` object. The first way
    is to construct it from JavaScript (`var memory = new WebAssembly.Memory(...)`),
    while the second way is to have it exported by a WebAssembly module. The important
    takeaway is that memory can be passed easily between JavaScript and WebAssembly.

- en: The `WebAssembly.Table` object is an array-like structure that is used to store
    function references. Just as with `WebAssembly.Memory`, a `Table` can be accessed
    and changed from both JavaScript and WebAssembly. As of the time of writing, tables
    can only store function references, but it's likely that, as the technology evolves,
    additional entities will be able to be stored in tables as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create a new `Table` instance, you need to pass an object with an `element`,
    `initial`, and (optional) `maximum` value. The `element` member is a string that
    represents the type of value stored in the table; currently the only valid value
    is `"anyfunc"` (for functions). The `initial` and `maximum` values represent the
    number of elements in the WebAssembly `Table`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can access the number of elements in the `Table` instance using the `length`
    property. The instance also includes methods to manipulate and query elements
    in the table. The `get()` method allows you to access the element at the given
    index, which is passed in as a parameter. The `set()` method allows you to set
    an element at the index specified as the first parameter to the value specified
    as the second parameter (per the preceding note, only functions are supported).
    Finally, `grow()` allows you to increase the size of the `Table` instance (number
    of elements) by the number passed in as a parameter.

    the nature of each error, which may be raised if the specified condition is met.
    All three errors can be constructed with a message, filename, and line number
    parameter (all of which are optional), and has the same properties and methods
    as the standard JavaScript `Error` object.

    can still be confusing. As we progress through the examples in this book and you're

    is an online code editing tool that allows you to write some C or C++ code and
    convert it to Wat, compile it to Wasm, or interact with it directly using JavaScript.
    The C/C++ and JavaScript editors are minimal and aren''t intended to be used as
    your primary development environment, but it offers a valuable service in the
    Wasm compiler. In [Chapter 3](706c89b2-c820-4fb0-906c-2f2e49602d27.xhtml), *Setting
    Up A Development Environment*, you''ll discover that going from square one to
    generating Wasm files requires a little bit of work—being able to paste your C
    code into the browser and hitting a couple of buttons makes things much more convenient.
    The following diagram gives a quick overview of the interface:'

    of Wat's s-expressions in the beginning of this chapter. Digging a little deeper,
    you can see how the C code corresponds to the Wat output. The `addTwo()` function
    is exported from the module as a string on line `5`. Line `5` also contains `(func
    $addTwo)`, which references the `$addTwo` function on line `6`. Line `6` specifies
    that a single parameter of type `i32` (an integer) can be passed in and the result
    returned is also an `i32`. Pressing the Build button in the upper-right corner
    (or above the C/C++ editor) will compile the C code into a Wasm file. The Wasm
    will be available for download or interaction with JavaScript once the build is
    completed.

    function that ensures the output is printed to the lower-right pane (the number
    `4`). Note how the JavaScript code interacts with `wasmInstance`. The `addTwo()`
    function is called from the instance's `exports` object. Although this was a contrived
    example, it demonstrates the steps C or C++ code goes through before it can be
    used by JavaScript as a Wasm module.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we discussed the elements of WebAssembly and their relationship.
    The structure of the *Core Specification* was used to describe the mapping of
    the text and binary formats to a common abstract syntax. We highlighted aspects
    of the text format (Wat) that can be useful in the context of debugging and development,
    as well as why s-expressions are an excellent fit for the textual representation
    of the abstract syntax. We also reviewed details pertaining to the binary format
    and the various elements that make up a module. The methods and objects within
    the JavaScript and Web APIs were defined with descriptions of their roles with
    regard to WebAssembly interaction. Finally, a simple example of the relationship
    between source code, Wat, and JavaScript was presented using the WasmFiddle tool.

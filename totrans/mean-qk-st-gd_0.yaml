- en: The MERN stack can be seen as a collection of tools that share a common denominator
    that is the language, JavaScript. The book explores, in the form of recipes, how
    to build web client and server applications using the MERN stack following the
    MVC architectural pattern.

- en: The model and controller of the MVC architectural pattern are covered by the
    chapters about building RESTful APIs with ExpressJS and Mongoose. The chapters
    cover core concepts about the HTTP protocol, type of methods, status codes, URLs,
    REST, and CRUD operations. Afterward, it moves to topics specific to ExpressJS,
    such as request handlers, middleware, and security, as well as specific topics
    about Mongoose, such as schemas, models, and custom validation.

    ReactJS is a UI library that is component-based with a declarative API. The book's
    aim to provide the essential knowledge for building ReactJS web applications and
    components. Complementary to ReactJS, the book contains an entire chapter about
    Redux that explains from the very core concepts and principles to advanced features
    such as store enhancers, time travelling, and asynchronous data flow.

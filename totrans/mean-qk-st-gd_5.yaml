    developers to manage the state of their applications with ease. With Redux, the
    state is immutable. Thus, it is possible to go back and forth to the next or previous
    state of your application. Redux is bound to three core principles:'
  prefs: []

    in a single object tree within one single store'

    an action can the state tree change'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Changes are made with pure functions**: These are called reducers, which
    are functions that accept the previous state and an action and compute a new state.
    Reducers must never mutate the previous state but rather always return a new one'

    increment the accumulator by `10`. Because the initial value of the accumulator
    is `0`, the next current value will be `10`
  prefs:

    chain. However, in our case, there is no next middleware, so the control is passed
    to the original dispatch method of the store that will apply the reducer and transform
    the state. On the other side, if the action type was not defined, the middleware
    function interrupts the middleware chain by not calling the `next` function and
    by throwing an error.

    to successfully prepare for a migration. Along with the introduction to the distributions,
    we will have a look at the licensing options, as well as the differences between
    free and commercial open-source software. Commercial Linux distributions have
    various add-on features and support options. We will also cover some typical use

    they are covered by copyright laws. To make things very complicated, there are
    numerous open-source licenses covering different parts of a Linux distribution.
    Some components may be covered by a **GNU General Public License** (**GPL**),
    some by an **Apache License** (**APL**), and some by an MIT license. To make this
    even more complex, it is important to realize that there may be multiple versions
    of the same license and that they may not all be compatible with each other or
    with any other license whatsoever.

    follow the rules of where and how you can use the software. It also says many

    things, but in a typical sales conversation, you may hear someone talk about Linux
    licenses—and as we learned earlier, those are not the licenses you are looking

    commercial Linux distribution. It very often also comes with a technical support
    service with varying service level agreements. In order to subscribe to such a
    service, you will need to sign a contract with a commercial Linux vendor on behalf
    of your employer. This contract is usually referred to as an enterprise agreement,
    and it typically comes with some additional obligations. One of these obligations
    is to follow the rules of the service subscription agreement.'

    Red Hat if you want to move your Linux servers to the public cloud.

    on the business applications they use. Red Hat and SUSE are the two most famous
    enterprise Linux development companies and vendors and they both have similar
    offerings around the Linux operating system area. Nowadays, the third commercial
    Linux vendor, Canonical, is playing in the same category. Their Ubuntu Linux used
    to be best known as a developer workstation distribution, and it has quickly gained
    popularity as a production server operating system as well. Coupled with Canonical's
    commercial support offering, Ubuntu Linux is a great alternative to the two leading

    dozens of small open-source companies, such as Cygnus (cross-platform tools),
    JBoss (Java middleware), Qumranet (the creators of KVM virtualization technology),
    Makara (a PaaS platform, the first version of OpenShift), ManageIQ (a hybrid cloud

    Systementwicklung mbH* and used the acronym SuSE, which came from the German phrase
    *Software- und System-Entwicklung,* meaning *software and systems development.*
    The first version of their product was an extension of the then-popular Slackware
    Linux distribution. In 1996, they released their first Linux distribution, based
    on the already-forgotten Linux distribution Jurix, and deviated from Slackware.

    is deallocated, the compute cores are not utilized, which means no charges are
    incurred for compute cores or the license. This model is ideal for VMs that are
    deployed for testing and will be running for a short period of time, but if you
    have VMs running 24/7/365, this might not be the ideal model, as the license cost
    will keep on accumulating based on hours used. In these cases, it is better to

    to Azure with **bring-your-own-subscription** (**BYOS**) billing. Normally, in
    the case of the PAYG model, you pay for both infrastructure (compute + storage
    + network) costs and software (license) costs. Since you are bringing your own
    subscription here, though, the software cost is nullified, and you pay only for
    the infrastructure, which drastically reduces the cost of hosting in Azure. You
    can convert your existing VMs under the PAYG model to BYOS billing without any
    downtime, which also means that the redeployment of these services is not required
    at all. When your BYOS expires, you can convert these VMs back to the PAYG model

    purchase SLES Priority for 2-4 vCPUs. If you were to purchase SLES for HPC 1-2
    vCPUs instead of SLES Priority for 2-4 vCPUs by mistake, then you would not get
    the benefit and you would not be able to return or exchange this plan. A piece

    you purchase, the discount is applied automatically to the instances. Assume that
    we purchased two SLES Priority for 2-4 vCPU plans; then, two out of three VMs
    will get the benefit and the remaining one will remain in the PAYG model. If you
    need the third one's cost also covered by the plan, then you need to buy another
    plan of the same kind. This new plan will automatically attach to the remaining
    VM.

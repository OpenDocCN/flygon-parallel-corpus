    strategies**. Passive strategies include arbitrage trading to profit from very
    small price differentials for the same asset, or its derivatives, traded on different
    venues. Aggressive strategies include order anticipation or momentum ignition.
    Order anticipation, also known as liquidity detection, involves algorithms that
    submit small exploratory orders to detect hidden liquidity from large institutional
    investors and trade ahead of a large order to benefit from subsequent price movements.
    Momentum ignition implies an algorithm executing and canceling a series of orders to
    spoof other HFT algorithms into buying (or selling) more aggressively and benefit
    from the resulting price changes.

    with the investment. An equity investment implies, for example, assuming a company's
    business risk, and a bond investment entails default risk. To the extent that
    **specific risk characteristics predict returns**, identifying and forecasting
    the behavior of these risk factors becomes a primary focus when designing an investment
    strategy. It yields valuable trading signals and is the key to superior active-management
    results. The industry's understanding of risk factors has evolved very substantially

    and systematic sources of risk for a given asset. Idiosyncratic risk can be eliminated
    through diversification, but systematic risk cannot. In the early 1960s, the **capital
    asset pricing model** (**CAPM**) identified a single factor driving all asset
    returns: the return on the market portfolio in excess of T-bills. The market portfolio
    consisted of all tradable securities, weighted by their market value. The systematic
    exposure of an asset to the market is measured by **beta**, which is the correlation
    between the returns of the asset and the market portfolio.'

    but rather how it moves relative to other assets and the market as a whole, was

    based on their exposure to underlying, **common risks** experienced by all assets,
    not due to their specific, idiosyncratic characteristics.

    critical questions regarding the CAPM prediction that an asset's risk premium
    depends only on its exposure to a single factor measured by the asset's beta.
    Instead, **numerous additional risk factors** have since been discovered. A factor
    is a quantifiable signal, attribute, or any variable that has historically correlated
    with future stock returns and is expected to remain correlated in the future.

    market hypothesis** (**EMH**). The EMH maintains that market equilibrium would
    always price securities according to the CAPM so that no other factors should
    have predictive power (Malkiel 2003). The economic theory behind factors can be
    either rational, where factor risk premiums compensate for low returns during
    bad times, or behavioral, where agents fail to arbitrage away excess returns.

    predict returns while controlling for the CAPM market factor. The **size effect**
    rests on small firms systematically outperforming large firms (Banz 1981; Reinganum
    1981). The **value effect** (Basu et. al. 1981) states that firms with low valuation
    metrics outperform their counterparts with the opposite characteristics. It suggests
    that firms with low price multiples, such as the price-to-earnings or the price-to-book
    ratios, perform better than their more expensive peers (as suggested by the inventors
    of value investing, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, and popularized by Warren

    momentum stocks with similar market risk. Researchers also found that value and
    momentum factors explain returns for stocks outside the US, as well as for other
    asset classes, such as bonds, currencies, and commodities, and additional risk
    factors (Jegadeesh and Titman 1993; Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen 2013).

    just the market portfolio. In 1976, Stephen Ross proposed the **arbitrage pricing
    theory**, which asserted that investors are compensated for multiple systematic
    sources of risk that cannot be diversified away (Roll and Ross 1984). The three
    most important macro factors are growth, inflation, and volatility, in addition
    to productivity, demographic, and political risk. In 1993, Eugene Fama and Kenneth
    French combined the equity risk factors'' size and value with a market factor
    into a single three-factor model that better explained cross-sectional stock returns.
    They later added a model that also included bond risk factors to simultaneously
    explain returns for both asset classes (Fama and French 1993; 2015).'

    correlation**. Value and momentum risk factors, for instance, are negatively correlated,
    reducing the risk and increasing risk-adjusted returns above and beyond the benefit
    implied by the risk factors. Furthermore, using leverage and long-short strategies,
    factor strategies can be combined into **market-neutral approaches**. The combination
    of long positions in securities exposed to positive risks with underweight or
    short positions in the securities exposed to negative risks allows for the collection
    of dynamic risk premiums.

    incorporated into investment styles that tilt portfolios in favor of one or more
    factors, and assets began to migrate into factor-based portfolios. The 2008 financial

    a false sense of diversification when investors do not look at the underlying

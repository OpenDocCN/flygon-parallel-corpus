    Positive price changes for one asset are more likely to offset losses on another,
    the lower the correlation between the two positions is. Based on how portfolio
    risk depends on the positions' covariance, Harry Markowitz developed the theory
    behind modern portfolio management based on diversification in 1952\. The result
    is mean-variance optimization, which selects weights for a given set of assets
    to minimize risk, measured as the standard deviation of returns for a given expected

    that is optimal for long-term capital growth when the odds are favorable, but
    uncertainty remains. His rule maximizes logarithmic wealth as a function of the
    odds of success of each game and includes implicit bankruptcy protection since
    *log(0)* is negative infinity so that a Kelly gambler would naturally avoid losing

- en: In this chapter, we covered the important topic of portfolio management, which
    involves the combination of investment positions with the objective of managing
    risk-return trade-offs. We introduced pyfolio to compute and visualize key risk
    and return metrics, as well as to compare the performance of various algorithms.

- en: We saw how important accurate predictions are for optimizing portfolio weights
    and maximizing diversification benefits. We also explored how machine learning
    can facilitate more effective portfolio construction by learning hierarchical
    relationships from the asset-returns covariance matrix.

- en: We will now move on to the second part of this book, which focuses on the use
    of machine learning models. These models will produce more accurate predictions
    by making more effective use of more diverse information. They do this to capture
    more complex patterns than the simpler alpha factors that were most prominent
    so far.

- en: We will begin by training, testing, and tuning linear models for regression
    and classification using cross-validation to achieve robust out-of-sample performance.
    We will also embed these models within the framework for defining and backtesting
    algorithmic trading strategies, which we covered in the previous two chapters.

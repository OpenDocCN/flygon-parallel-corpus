    in MongoDB. You will learn how to identify the parameters and structure of the
    aggregate command, combine and manipulate data using the primary aggregation stages,
    work with large datasets using advanced aggregation stages, and optimize and configure
    your aggregation to get the best performance out of your queries.

- en: In the previous chapters, we learned the fundamentals of interacting with MongoDB.
    With these basic operations (`insert`, `update`, and `delete`), we can now begin
    exploring and manipulating our data as we would with any other database. We also
    observed how, by fully leveraging the `find` command options, we can use operators
    to answer more specific questions about our data. We can also sort, limit, skip,
    and project on our query to create useful result sets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In more straightforward situations, these result sets may be enough to answer
    your desired business question or satisfy a use case. However, more complex problems
    require more complex queries to answer. Solving such problems with just the `find`
    command would be highly challenging and would likely require multiple queries
    or some processing on the client side to organize or link the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basic limitation is where you have data contained in two separate collections.
    To find the correct data, you would have to run two queries instead of one, joining
    the data on the client or application level. This may not seem like a big problem,
    but as your application or dataset increases in scale, performance and complexity
    also grow. Wherever possible, it is ideal for the server to do all the heavy lifting,
    returning only the data we are looking for in a single query. This is where the
    **aggregation pipeline** comes in.

- en: The `find` command. Beyond that, the pipeline structure of aggregation allows
    developers and database analysts to easily, iteratively, and quickly build queries
    on ever-changing and growing datasets. If you want to accomplish anything significant
    at scale in MongoDB, you'll need to write complex, multi-stage aggregation pipelines.
    In this chapter, we will learn exactly how to do that.

    movie marathon and is trying to decide what their lineup should be. They need
    a variety of popular movies meeting specific criteria to satisfy their customer
    base. The company has asked you to research and determine the films they should
    show. In this chapter, we will use aggregations to retrieve data given a complex
    set of constraints, and then transform and manipulate data to create new results
    and answer business questions across our entire dataset with a single query. This
    will help the cinema company decide what movies they should be showing to satisfy
    their customers.

    are many ways to accomplish the same task. The exercises and activities covered
    in this chapter are just one solution to the scenarios posed and can be solved
    using different patterns. The best way to master the aggregation pipeline is to
    consider multiple methods to solve the same problem.

    provide the criteria for your query in the form of JSON documents, and it outputs
    a `cursor` containing the search result. Sounds simple, right? That's because
    it is. Although aggregations can become very large and complex, at their core,
    they are relatively simple.

    shortly, but at a high level, a pipeline is a series of instructions, where the
    input to each instruction is the output of the previous one. Simply put, aggregation
    is a method for taking a collection and, in a procedural way, filtering, transforming,
    and joining data from other collections to create new, meaningful datasets.

    all the logic to find, sort, project, limit, transform, and aggregate our data.
    The `pipeline` parameter itself is passed in as an array of JSON documents. You
    can think of this as a series of instructions to be sent to the database, and
    then the resulting data after the final stage is stored in a `cursor` to be returned
    to you. Each stage in the pipeline is completed independently, one after another,
    until none are remaining. The input to the first stage is the collection (`movies`
    in the preceding example), and the input into each subsequent stage is the output
    from the previous stage.

    get in production, but one of its strengths is the ability to break down large
    pipelines into smaller subsections or individual stages. By looking at stages
    individually and sequentially, seemingly incomprehensible queries can become reasonably
    straightforward. It's also important to note that the order of the steps is just
    as important as the stages themselves, not just logically but also to increase
    performance. The `$match` and `$project` stages execute first because these will
    reduce the size of the result set at each stage. Although not applicable to every
    type of query, it is generally good practice to try and reduce the number of documents
    you are working with early on, disregarding any documents that will add excessive
    loads to the server.

    provides that the `find` command does not.

    aggregate*) documents based on a specific condition. Although there are many other
    stages and methods to accomplish various tasks with the `aggregate` command, the
    `$group` stage serves as the cornerstone of the most powerful queries. Previously,
    the most significant unit of data we could return was a single document. We can
    sort these documents to gain insight through a direct comparison of the documents.
    However, once we master the `$group` stage, we will be able to increase the scope
    of our queries to an entire collection by aggregating our documents into large
    logical units. Once we have the larger groups, we can apply our filters, sorts,
    limits, and projections just as we did on a per-document basis.

    the `rated` field. As stated previously, the value of our `_id` key was an *expression*.
    In aggregation terms, an expression can be a literal, an expression object, an
    operator, or a field path. In this case, we are passing in a field path, which
    tells the pipeline which field to access in the input documents. You may or may
    not have run into field paths before in MongoDB.

    a find command. This is because when aggregating, we need to tell the pipeline
    that we want to access the field of the document that it is currently aggregating.
    The `$group` stage will interpret `_id: "$rated"` as equivalent to `_id: "$$CURRENT.rated"`.
    This may seem complicated, but it indicates that for each document, it will fit
    into the group matching that same (current) document with the `"rated"` key. This

    time before and after our aggregation. This is a valid technique, and you may
    often time your MongoDB queries on the client or application side. However, this
    only gives us a rough approximation of duration and only tells us the total time
    the response took to reach the client, not how long the server took to execute
    the pipeline. MongoDB provides us with a great way of learning exactly how it
    executed our requested query. This feature is known as **Explain** and is the
    usual way to examine and optimize our MongoDB commands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there is one catch. **Explain** does not yet support detailed execution
    plans for aggregations, meaning its use is limited when it comes to the optimization
    of pipelines. **Explain** and execution plans will be covered in more detail later
    in this book. Since we can't rely on **Explain** to analyze our pipelines, it
    becomes even more integral to carefully construct and plan our pipeline to improve
    the performance of our aggregations. Although there is no single correct method
    that will work in any situation, there are some heuristics that can generally
    be helpful. We'll walk through a few of these methods with examples. MongoDB does
    a lot of performance optimization under the hood, but these are still good patterns
    to follow.

    to understand, write, comprehend, and improve MongoDB aggregations. This new functionality
    will help you to answer more complex and difficult questions about your data.
    By creating multi-stage pipelines that join multiple collections, you can increase
    the scope of your queries to the entire database instead of a single collection.
    We also looked at how to write the results into a new collection to enable further
    exploration or manipulation of the data.

    are written with scalability, readability, and performance in mind. By focusing
    on these aspects, your pipelines will continue to deliver value in the future
    and can act as a basis for further aggregations.

    It begins with a scenario wherein an imaginary city council and a local start-up
    jointly develop a mobile-application-based bike-sharing platform. It will then
    cover a detailed project proposal and a few challenges, and how the challenges
    are solved by using a MongoDB Atlas-based Database-as-a-Service solution. Finally,
    you will explore how MongoDB can be used for some use cases, go through each of
    them, and verify that the database design covers all the requirements.

- en: The Fair Bay City Bike project is a dockless bike-sharing project. Generally,
    bikes need dedicated docking stations where they remain locked. Users need to
    access these docking stations to start and end their rides. The major drawback
    of such systems is setting up docking station infrastructure evenly across the
    city. Establishing such a network involves finding a safe and suitable place in
    every area, which is often unaffordable. Secondly, people tend to find it difficult
    to locate and access the docking stations. Not finding an empty docking station
    close to the destination is a common problem for users, which discourages them
    from using the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    unlocking mechanism. They can be picked up, parked, and left in any safe place
    or any dedicated parking area. Users can pick up any of the bikes that are parked
    in their surrounding area and leave them in any safe parking space close to their
    destination.

    on their location, a list of the closest available bikes will be displayed in
    a map view. The user can then select any of the available bikes and use the in-app
    navigation assistance to reach it. Next, the user needs to scan a unique Quick

    with its cutting-edge features and low-cost implementations, as the dockless system
    is a lot cheaper than using docking bikes. The council is ready to procure the
    bikes, construct cycle lanes, and implement the signaling system throughout the
    city. They will also prepare the usage and safety guidelines as well as handling
    advertising. The team at the start-up is responsible for building the IT infrastructure

    and proven technologies. The technical team already has the mobile application
    and the backend application ready. The only thing they need to do now is to decide
    on a suitable database platform. A database is required to persist customer details,
    bike details, real-time locations of the bikes, and ride details. This database
    platform should be quick to set up without worrying much about the infrastructure,
    integrations, security, or backups. The team has decided to go for a **Database-as-a-Service**
    (**DBaaS**) solution to provide a reliable, scalable solution, and reduce the

    a budget crunch. For this reason, they have decided to start with 200 bikes first,
    observe the effectiveness, and seek public feedback. Based on this feedback, they
    are willing to increase the fleet size to 1,000, or even 2,000 if required. This
    increase in fleet size will in turn lead to an increase in the data to be managed.
    For this, **DBaaS** platforms are a great choice as it allows you to start with
    minimal setup and scale as and when you need.
  prefs: []

    there will not be any need for large dataset processing, and so the team has decided
    to go for low RAM and low CPU clusters. As the fleet size grows, they can scale
    up or scale out and the costs will always be optimized to the usage requirements.

    However, before they are incorporated into the system, some analysis needs to

    requires integration with federal and external systems. This integration needs
    to comply with different rules, regulations, and safety and privacy policies issued
    by the concerned departments.

    plan for phase 1 of the rollout. The requirements for the suggested changes will
    be finalized and incorporated in phase 2 of the project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The technical team understands that the system needs to be flexible enough to
    incorporate any future changes that are still unknown or uncertain. With the current
    technical design, the user has a driving license number as ID, but it needs to
    be more flexible to store other types of ID. Also, to charge the fees, the schema
    needs to be flexible enough to incorporate users' bank accounts or credit card
    details. Similarly, to introduce scooters in the fleet (which may have different
    maintenance requirements or a different fee structure), the system needs to be
    able to differentiate between a cycle and a scooter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this scenario, traditional database entities, which are bound to strict schema
    definitions, are not a good choice. To incorporate some of the future changes,
    their schema definitions need to be updated first. With traditional databases,
    the schema changes are difficult to roll out and roll back. Upon careful consideration
    and comparison, the team has decided to go for a MongoDB Atlas cluster. MongoDB
    provides a flexible schema and horizontal as well as vertical scaling capabilities.
    The Atlas cluster helps to roll out a production-level system with just a few
    clicks and saves significantly on cost and time. In the next section, we will

    plan to roll out scooters in the future, a field named `vehicle_type` is introduced.
    This field differentiates between a bike and a scooter. The `status` field denotes
    whether the bike is currently available, on a ride, or under maintenance (in this
    case, it is available). This field can hold any of these three values: `available`,
    `on_ride`, and `under_maintenance`. The last maintenance date helps identify whether
    the vehicle is due for maintenance. The `location` field represents the current
    geographical location of the vehicle, and it is represented in MongoDB''s geospatial

    identify areas of improvement and optimization as well as to assess the system
    benefits in terms of the money being spent. They can use the database in more
    than one way; however, we will use a sample use case for demonstration.

    and crowded place. To make riding easy for cyclists, the council has built special
    cycle lanes in the area surrounding the park. The council wants to know how many
    City Bike riders have traveled on these lanes.

- en: This chapter explored the City Bikes project implemented by an imaginary city
    council. This began with a consideration of the predicted problems faced by the
    council and how the project proposal might address those problems. Among these
    considerations were the council's time and budget, uncertain requirements, and
    the technical team's decision to use a MongoDB Atlas-based **Database-as-a-Service**
    (**DBaaS**) solution to address all these issues. You studied the database design
    in detail and reviewed MongoDB queries to log, implement, and resolve several
    example scenarios in this example system.

    of MongoDB through practical examples and applications. You started with the basics
    of MongoDB, looking at its nature and function, and how it differs from traditional
    RDBMS databases. You then uncovered the benefits offered by its JSON-based data
    structure and flexible schema. Next, you learned the core database operations
    and operators to find, aggregate, insert, update, and delete data from collections,
    as well as more advanced concepts such as performance improvement, replication,
    backup and restore, and data visualization. You also created your own MongoDB
    database cluster in the cloud using MongoDB Atlas, then loaded a real-life example
    dataset into the cluster, which you used throughout the book. Finally, this chapter
    concluded this course by demonstrating how MongoDB solutions can solve real-life
    problems.

    you will be able to implement a highly scalable, robust database design that meets
    business requirements at your workplace, or for your own personal projects.

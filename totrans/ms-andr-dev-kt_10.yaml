    We made great progress. However, our journey to Android concurrency mechanisms
    is not over yet. We have to present, perhaps, the most important part of the Android
    Framework--Android services. In this chapter, we will explain what are services,
    and when and how to use them.

    type, we must answer the question of what Android service really is. Well, **Android
    service** is a mechanism provided by the Android Framework by which we can move
    the execution of long running tasks to the background. Android service provides
    some nice additional features that can make a developer's work more flexible and
    easier. To explain how it will make our development easier, we will create a service
    by extending our Journaler application.

    be started by any Android application component and continue running as long as
    it's needed, even if we leave our application or kill it.

    by the end user. For example, we will perform synchronization with our backend
    instance. The user does not need to know about our progress. We decided not to
    bother the user with that. Everything will be performed silently in the background

    to be executed. Interacting with a service in Android is very simple. A component
    binds to a service and, as long there is at least one such component, the service
    keeps running. When there are no components bound to a service, the service is
    destroyed.

    is triggered by some Android component. After the method is executed, Android
    service is started and can run in the background indefinitely. To stop this service,
    you must execute the `stopService()` method that has an opposite functionality
    to the `startService()` method.'

    `bindService()` method. After we bind, the `onBind()` method is executed. In your
    service implementation of this method, you must provide an interface that clients
    use to communicate with the service by returning an `Ibinder` class instance.
    Implementing this method is not optional, but if you don''t plan to bind to the
    service, just return `null`.'

    `IntentService` uses the worker thread to process requests one by one. We must

    it. To perform binding, we must call the `bindService()` method. When you want
    to interact with the service from activities or other Android components, service
    binding is necessary. For bind to work, you must implement the `onBind()` method
    and return an `IBinder` instance. If there are no interested parties anymore,
    and all of them are unbound, Android destroys the service. For this type of service,
    you do not need to perform the stop routine.

    with the specific purpose of developing, testing, and packaging Android applications.
    It can be downloaded, along with the Android SDK, as a single package, but as
    we shall see throughout the course of this book, it is, in reality, a collection
    of tools and components, many of which are installed and updated independently
    of each other.

    to building and distribution. Android Studio provides some useful and smart tools

    plugins that provide a large array of valuable functions, not available directly

    the relevant sections. Throughout the book, we will be finding ways to speed up
    tedious and difficult tasks using these plugins and Android Studio's built in

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many ways that Android Studio differs from other IDEs and development
    tools. Some of these differences are quite subtle, such as the way support libraries
    are installed, and others, for instance the build process and the UI design, are
    profoundly different.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Before taking a closer look at the IDE itself, it is a good idea to first understand
    what some of these important differences are. The major ones are listed here:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**UI development**: The most significant difference between Studio and other
    IDEs is its layout editor, which is far superior to any of its rivals, offering
    text, design, and blueprint views, and most importantly, constraint layout tools for
    every activity or fragment, an easy-to-use theme and style editors, and a drag-and-drop
    design function. The layout editor also provides many tools unavailable elsewhere,
    such as a comprehensive preview function for viewing layouts on a multitude of
    devices and simple-to-use theme and translation editors.'

    the same, the way Android Studio organizes each project differs considerably from
    its predecessors. Rather than using workspaces as in Eclipse, Studio employs modules
    that can more easily be worked on together without having to switch workspaces.'

    will soon see how much time it can save once it becomes familiar.

    completes code as you type makes it a delight to use. It regularly anticipates
    what you are about to type, and often a whole line of code can be entered with
    no more than two or three keystrokes. Refactoring too, is easier and more far-reaching
    than alternative IDEs, such as Eclipse and NetBeans. Almost anything can be renamed,
    from local variables to entire packages.'

    allowing developers to create device emulators to model any number of real-world
    devices. These emulators are highly customizable, both in terms of form factor
    and hardware configurations, and virtual devices can be downloaded from many manufacturers.
    Users of other IDEs will be familiar with Android AVDs already, although they
    will certainly appreciate the preview features found in the Design tab.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Build tools:** Android Studio employs the Gradle build system, which performs
    the same functions as the Apache Ant system that many Java developers will be
    familiar with. It does, however, offer a lot more flexibility and allows for customized
    builds, enabling developers to create APKs that can be uploaded to TestFlight,
    or to produce demo versions of an app, with ease. It is also the Gradle system
    that allows for the modular nature discussed previously. Rather than each library
    or a third-party SDK being compiled as a JAR file, Studio builds each of these
    using Gradle.'

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the most far-reaching differences between Android Studio and other
    IDEs, but there are more as well as many features that are unique. Studio provides
    the powerful JUnit test facility and allows for cloud platform support and even
    Wi-Fi debugging. It is also considerably faster than Eclipse, which, to be fair,
    has to cater for a wider range of development needs, as opposed to just one, and
    it can be run on less powerful machines.

    Run. This feature cleverly only builds the part of a project that has been edited,
    meaning that developers can test small changes to code without having to wait
    for a complete build to be performed for each test. This feature can bring these
    waiting times down from minutes to almost zero.

    An examination of the `project` folder on disk will show that there are in fact
    two (or more) folders inside the `res` directory named `values` and `values-fr`.
    Not only does this help organize our work but it also helps minimize the space
    our apps take up on a device, as only the resource folders that are needed are

    changed since the last build, and providing the manifest file has not been edited,
    the app is not even reinstalled, and in some cases, the launch activity is not
    even restarted.

    all versions of Android and, to take full advantage of it, you will need to set
    the minimum SDK level to API 21 or higher, although elements of it will work with
    API level 15 and higher. In Android Studio, this level is set from the `build.gradle
    (Module: app)` file, as follows:'

- en: More often than not, we try to make our apps as backward-compatible as possible
    and developing an app that only works with API level 21 or higher would seriously
    limit the number of users we can reach. However, the time Instant Run saves us
    makes it worthwhile to test and debug an app API 21 or higher and then, later,
    reassemble it to match the versions we wish to target.

    and will prove invaluable once complete. However, it may be that you have projects
    developed in other IDEs that you wish to continue developing using Studio. Fortunately,
    this is a simple task, as the following section demonstrates.

    after 15 years, many of us have become very familiar with it. When it comes to
    developing for a variety of platforms, Eclipse is a fantastic tool but cannot
    compete with Android Studio when it comes to developing Android applications.

    untouched, meaning it can still be worked on in Eclipse if you wish. Unfortunately,
    it is not possible to import third-party plugins but a large and growing number
    of plugins are available for Studio, and it is more than likely that you will
    be able to find equivalents. These can be browsed from File | Settings | Plugins.

    for those readers who are unfamiliar with it. We explored how the workspace is
    structured and the various flavors of editor available to us. This exploration
    led us to create a Material Design theme, use tool windows to perform a variety
    of useful tasks, as well as apply Instant Run to speed up the otherwise time-consuming
    build process.

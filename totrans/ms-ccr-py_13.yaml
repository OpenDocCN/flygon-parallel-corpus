    thread) cannot gain access to the necessary resources in order to proceed with
    its execution and, therefore, cannot make any progress. In this section, we will
    look into the characteristics of a starvation situation, analyze the most common
    causes of starvation, and finally, consider a sample program that exemplifies

    first process to have the highest priority of execution and access to resources,
    then the second process, and then the last process, with the lowest priority.
    However, imagine situations in which the first two processes (with higher priorities)
    run so often that the third process cannot execute its instructions; anytime the
    third process needs to run, it checks to see whether the resources are available
    to be used and finds out that one of the other, higher-priority processes is using
    them.

    given more opportunities to run and, therefore, they are constantly executing.

- en: In the next few subsections, we will be discussing the potential candidates
    that cause starvation situations. Most of the time, a poorly coordinated set of scheduling
    instructions is the main cause of starvation. For example, a considerably naive
    algorithm that deals with three separate tasks might implement constant communication
    and interaction between the first two tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This setup leads to the fact that the execution flow of the algorithm switches
    solely between the first and second tasks, while the third finds itself idle and
    unable to make any progress with its execution; in this case, because it is starved
    of CPU execution flow. Intuitively, we can identify the root of the problem as
    the fact that the algorithm allows the first two tasks to always dominate the
    CPU, and hence, effectively prevents any other task to also utilize the CPU. A
    characteristic of a good scheduling algorithm is the ability to distribute the
    execution flow and allocate the resources equally and appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned previously, many concurrent systems and programs implement a specific
    order of priority, in terms of process and thread execution. This implementation
    of ordered scheduling may very likely lead to the starvation of processes and
    threads of lower priorities and can result in a condition called **priority inversion**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose that, in your concurrent program, you have process A of the highest
    priority, process B of a medium priority, and finally, process C of the lowest
    priority; process C would most likely be put in the situation of starvation. Additionally,
    if the execution of process A, the prioritized process, is dependent on the completion
    of process C, which is already in starvation, then process A might never be able
    to complete its execution, either, even though it is given the highest priority
    in the concurrent program.

- en: Problem statement
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a readers-writers problem, first and foremost, we have a shared resource,
    which, in most cases, is a text file. Different threads interact with that text
    file; each is either a reader or a writer. A **reader** is a thread that simply
    accesses the shared resource (the text file) and reads in the data included in
    that file, while a **writer** is a thread that accesses, and possibly mutates,
    the contents of the text file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that writers and readers cannot access the shared resources simultaneously
    since if a thread is writing data to the file, no other thread should be accessing
    the file to read any data from it. The goal of the readers-writers problem is
    therefore to find a correct and efficient way to design and coordinate the scheduling
    of these reader and writer thread. A successful implementation of that goal is
    not only that the program as a whole executes in the most optimized way, but also
    that all threads are given sufficient opportunity to execute their instructions
    and no starvation can occur. Additionally, the shared resource (the text file)
    needs to be handled appropriately, so that no data will be corrupted.

- en: As we mentioned, the problem asks us to come up with a scheduling algorithm,
    so that readers and writers can access the text file appropriately and efficiently,
    without mishandling/corrupting the data that is included. A naive solution to
    this problem is to impose a lock on the text file, so that it becomes a non-shareable
    resource; this means that only one thread (either a reader or a writer) can access
    (and potentially manipulate) the text file at any given time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Yet, this approach simply equates to a sequential program: if the shared resource
    can be utilized by only one thread at a given time, none of the processing time
    between different threads can be overlapped, and effectively, the execution becomes
    sequential. Therefore, this is not an optimal solution, as it is taking advantage
    of concurrent programming.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One insight regarding the reader threads can lead to a more optimal solution
    to this problem: since readers simply read in the text file and do not alter the
    data in it, multiple readers can be allowed to access the text file simultaneously.
    Indeed, even if more than one reader is fetching data from the text file at the
    same time, the data is not being changed in any way, and the consistency and accuracy
    of the data is therefore maintained.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following this approach, we will implement a specification in which no reader
    will be kept waiting if the shared resource is being opened for reading by another
    reader. Specifically, in addition to a lock on the shared resource, we will also
    have a counter for the number of readers currently accessing the resource. If,
    at any point in the program, that counter goes from zero to one (in other words,
    at least one reader is starting to access the resource), we will lock the resource
    from the writers; similarly, whenever the counter decreases to zero (in other
    words, no reader is asking for access to the resource), we will release the lock
    on the resource, so that writers can access it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This specification is efficient for the readers, in the sense that, once the
    first reader has accessed the resource and placed a lock on it, no writers can
    access it, and the subsequent readers will not have to re-lock it until the last
    reader finishes reading the resource.

    the code for this book from the GitHub page, go ahead and navigate to the `Chapter13`

    string) and writing some data to the resource. Note that we are putting all of
    its instructions inside a `while` loop, to simulate the constant nature of the
    application (writers and readers constantly try to access the shared resource).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also see the reader logic in the `reader()` function. Before asking for
    access to the shared resource, each reader will increment a counter for the number
    of readers that are currently active and trying to access the resource. Similarly,
    after reading data off the file, each reader needs to decrement the number of
    readers. During this process, if a reader is the first reader to access the file
    (in other words, when the counter is one), it will put a lock on the file, so
    that no writers can access it; conversely, when a reader is the last reader to
    read the file, it has to release that lock.

    variable; specifically, without the lock, multiple threads can be accessing and
    altering the counter variable at the same time, but the only way to ensure the

    create a continuous stream of readers going through the text file, giving no room

    starts its execution and wants to access the file, it will be given priority over
    the writer that has already been waiting. Additionally, if more and more readers
    keep requesting access to the file, the writer will be waiting infinitely, and
    that was what we observed in our first code example.

- en: To address this problem, we will implement the specification that, once a writer
    makes a request to access the file, no reader should be able to jump in line and
    access the file before that writer. To do this, we will have an additional lock
    object in our program, to specify whether a writer is waiting for the file, and
    consequently, whether a reader thread can attempt to read the file; we will call
    this lock `read_try`.

    it from the writers, we will now have the first writer of the multiple that are

    in line before those writers that requested access before it. As we discussed
    in reference to the readers, since we are keeping track of the number of writers
    waiting for the text file, we will need to implement a counter for the number
    of writers, and its corresponding lock, in our program.

    while only the first and the last writers have to acquire and release the `read_try`

- en: Solving starvation in your concurrent program can be a rather complex and involved
    process, and a deep understanding of its scheduling algorithm, combined with an
    understanding of how processes and threads interact with the shared resources,
    is necessary during the process. As you saw in the example of the readers-writers
    problem, it can also take several implementations and revisions of different approaches
    to arrive at a good solution to starvation.

- en: Starvation is a problem in concurrent systems in which a process (or thread)
    cannot gain access to the necessary resources to proceed with its execution and,
    therefore, cannot make any progress. Most of the time, a poorly coordinated set
    of scheduling instructions is the main cause of starvation; deadlock situations
    can also lead to starvation.

- en: The readers-writers problem is one of the classic and most complex examples
    in the field of computer science, illustrating problems that might occur in a
    concurrent program. Through an analysis of different approaches to the readers-writers
    problem, you have gained insight regarding how starvation can be solved with different
    scheduling algorithms. Fairness is an essential element of a good scheduling algorithm,
    and, by making sure that the priority is distributed appropriately among different
    processes and threads, starvation can be eliminated.

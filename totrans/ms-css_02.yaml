    will help you become a better developer. In this chapter, we're going to look
    at text editors that will speed up our workflow. We'll then look at a *CSS reset*,
    which resets the default browser such that its styling is reduced to nothing,
    and the built-in browser developer tools to help us troubleshoot our code. Then,
    we'll look at how to rename elements with classes and IDs as well as qualify our
    selectors using descendant selectors.

    that writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is extremely error-prone. For CSS, commas,

    and are typically part of your website boilerplate. I call these pieces your "base
    layer". A big part of this *base layer* is the CSS reset. A reset allows you to
    eliminate browser inconsistencies with regard to default browser styling and eliminate
    all default browser styles in general. It allows *you* to more easily provide
    *your* handcrafted styles using CSS. In this section, we're going to first load

    The value of `1` is a unit-less value, so `1` will be equal to the size of the
    font. The value of `1.2` would be 1.2 times the size of the font. So, if the `font-size`

    and `line-height` and are inherited by child elements; only certain properties
    have this effect, mainly text-level properties behave like this. In this case,
    we set those properties on the `body` element, but they cascaded down to `h1`,

- en: Renaming elements with a simple class is so unbelievably powerful and probably
    the most useful thing in all of CSS. While naming classes, although sometimes
    tricky, it is important to make names semantic or meaningful. For example, if
    you're naming your blog post container, it's okay to name it "blog-post-container"
    because that perfectly describes what it is. IDs, although they have their time
    and place, aren't as useful as classes. It's best to just use a class in most
    circumstances to keep your specificity low. In the next section, you'll learn
    about how we can target elements by their context using descendant selectors.

- en: Renaming elements with classes, as you learned in the previous section, is an
    extremely powerful feature in CSS. However, that's not the only way to target
    a specific type of element. Descendant selectors will allow you to target elements
    on a page based on their ancestor elements. This is often necessary because you
    only want to apply a margin or a new font based on the context of the element.
    You can use a descendant selector to get that context without putting a class
    on every element every time you want to target it. I'm going to first explain
    what parent, sibling, and child elements are as well as what ancestor and descendant
    elements are. We'll need to be clear about these if we want to use descendant
    selectors. We'll follow this up by using a practical example of the descendant
    selector and finishing up by calculating the descendant selector's weight.

    They have so much unnecessary weight to them and drive the specificity level through

    game, but the difference is you want to try and keep your point value as low as
    possible on this game. If you do that, you will be able to write less complicated

    using *BEM*. BEM stands for *Block Element Modifier* and is a naming convention
    for CSS. The idea is to use a specific naming convention to add a class to every
    element you are eventually going to style. This way every element has a specificity
    score of 10, thus every element has the same specificity. There's a lot more to
    it that just that, and I recommend checking it out at [http://getbem.com/](http://getbem.com/)
    to learn more about it. I tend to use the BEM methodology, but that's not to say
    descendant selectors need to be completely avoided. I think there's a time and
    place for them. My suggestion is keep your descendant selectors reasonable and
    avoid longer descendant selectors with more than 3 levels.

- en: In order to create a multicolumn layout supported in all browsers, we are going
    to use floats. Floats are very simple at first glance but have a few unintuitive
    quirks to them that can cause some frustration when not completely understood.
    This may be because the true origination of floats wasn't for layout, it was to
    achieve the common magazine technique where text flows easily around an image.
    So in this chapter, we're going to delve into floats. We'll go over the basic
    usage of floats and follow that up by creating a layout with floats (and curing
    the headaches caused by floats in later sections)

    to win as the best method. I use it on every project. It can easily solve one
    of the biggest problems with floats: collapse. Another thing I like about the
    clearfix hack is that it is a very modular approach to CSS. Just add the `clearfix`
    class anywhere to your markup and you''ve gotten rid of collapsed containers.'

- en: 'In this chapter, we went over the traditional use of floating elements: flowing
    text around images. We then looked at using floats to build a multi-column layout.
    Finally, we learned how to tackle the problems that come with using floats. We
    found that the clearfix hack is the best method for fixing collapsed floats. In
    the next chapter, we''re going to expand on modular CSS as we create modern buttons
    using a modular approach.'

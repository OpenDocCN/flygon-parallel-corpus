- en: Having CSS that is modular and reusable makes it organized and concise, thereby
    avoiding situations where you may feel like pulling your hair out. Wouldn't it
    be awesome to just add the class of `.button` to an anchor element, no matter
    where that anchor element is in your markup, and have it transform into a button?
    CSS is "reusable" if you're able to use its classes anywhere and don't need these
    classes to be qualified by parent elements as long descendant selectors. The term
    "modular" refers to the ability to add variations to the button by adding another
    class to it so that one element can have two classes that could come together
    to form something very different.

    However, this concept should be applied everywhere, across all components of your
    website. We have a lot to go over in this chapter. We will cover modular CSS and
    multiple classes in the first two sections, before we switch gears and talk about
    how selectors can overrule each other in the specificity rules section. We''ll
    then get into CSS3 pretty heavily with transitions, transforms, and gradients,
    and we''ll go through every step of creating and styling a big call-to-action

    `Submit`, and `Add to cart`. All of which have different meanings so are all colored
    or styled slightly differently. In some scenarios, as in the case of our movies
    and index pages, the buttons just end up varying based on the page that they''re

    our button and created a few modular button-related classes that can be used to
    vary the style of the button. There are other ways we could have done this. I
    could have used a descendant selector to style the buttons based on their parent.
    That way, all the buttons inside of content-block would always be floated to the
    right and be white instead of dark gray. This would have been a decent alternative
    if it would have provided other areas, besides content blocks, the same alternative
    button styles, which is highly likely. Next, let's talk about why a modular, reusable,
    and light approach to CSS is necessary. We'll do this by talking about the rules

    classes as little chunks of CSS that can be used anywhere on the web page to style
    any element. This makes writing CSS very convenient. However, it only works if
    the CSS is kept lightweight. As you'll learn in this section, every CSS selector
    can be weighed on a scale, and the heaviest selector wins the style battle between
    two competing selectors. So, I'll start by explaining the weights of different
    selectors and how they can overrule one another. Then, we'll talk a bit about
    how the universal selector and the `!important` declaration fit into the weights

    a class selector as being worth 10 points. However, the long element selector
    will never beat one single class: `.i-beat-any-number-of-elements`. So technically,
    elements are worth 0,0,0,1 and classes are worth 0,0,1,0, ID''s are worth 0,1,0,0,
    and inline styles are worth 1,0,0,0\. But! Pause for emphasis. You''d be having
    a pretty bad experience if you ever created a selector consisting of more than
    10 elements. That would be a very bad idea, and I recommend that you try not to
    go more that 3 or 4 at the very most. So, instead of thinking of elements as worth
    0,0,0,1 and classes as worth 0,0,1,0, we can think in the terms I described previously

    is easier when you keep your selectors lightweight because you can then easily
    create modular, reusable classes in the form of a button. A big part of creating
    a modern website is overriding styles when you have to; you don't want to make
    this difficult. I strongly urge you to stick to classes and element selectors
    and be very conservative with your use of the `!important` declaration; steer
    clear of inline styles and IDs altogether.

    a smooth transition. We'll start this section by creating a hover state using
    the pseudo selector `:hover`. Then, we'll smooth it out with a transition before

- en: Universal JavaScript, or isomorphic JavaScript, are different names for a feature
    that we are going to implement in this chapter. To be more exact, we will develop
    our app and render the app's pages on both the server and client side. It will
    be different to **Angular1** or Backbone single-page apps which are mainly rendered
    on the client side. Our approach is more complicated in technological terms as
    you need to deploy your full-stack skills which work on server-side rendering,
    but having this experience will make you a more desirable programmer so you can
    advance your career to the next level--you will be able to charge more for your
    skills on the market.

    start-ups/companies, because it helps achieve better indexing by different search
    engines. It's an essential feature for any news and content-heavy website, because
    it helps grow organic traffic. In this chapter, we will also run our app with
    server-side rendering. Other companies where server-side rendering may be useful
    are entertainment businesses where users have less patience and they might close
    the browser if a webpage is loading slowly. In general, all **B2C** (consumer
    facing) apps should use server-side rendering to improve the experience for the
    people who visit their websites.

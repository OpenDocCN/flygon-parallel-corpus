    React view layer shall render in the browser. On the other hand, Falcor differs
    from Redux, because it is the full-stack toolset that replaces the outdated approach
    of API endpoints data communication. In the next pages, we will work with Falcor
    on the client side, but you need to remember that Factor is a full-stack library.
    That means, we need to use it on both sides (where on backend we use an additional
    library called Falcor-Router). Starting from [Chapter 5](text00140.html) , *Falcor
    Advanced Concepts* , we will work with full-stack Falcor. While in the current
    chapter, we will focus only on the client side.

    the state of our application in its single-state tree. The important drawback

    what the differences between Relay/GraphQL and Falcor are. Both are trying to
    solve similar problems, but in very different ways.

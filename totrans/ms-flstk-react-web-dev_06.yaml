    on Amazon's servers. It helps you host safe, secure, and highly scalable objects
    (as images) in the cloud.

    is why we will use it throughout our book.

- en: What is a bucket in Amazon S3? A **bucket** is a kind of namespace for files
    that you have in Amazon S3\. You can have several buckets associated with different
    projects. As you can see, our next steps will be creating the `accessKeyId` and
    `secretAccessKey` associated with your `accountDefine` and `bucketKey` (kind of
    a namespace for the pictures for our articles). Define a region where you want
    to keep the files physically. If your project has a target specified for a location,
    it will speed up the loading of images and, in general, limit the latency because
    an image will be hosted closer to the client/user of our publishing application.

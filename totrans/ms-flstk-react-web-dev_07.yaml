- en: We have come to the point where we need to start planning the deployment of
    our application. We have chosen MongoDB as our database. There are different approaches
    of using it for scaling--you can do everything on your own with your own servers
    (more time consuming and demanding) or you can use services that do replications/scaling
    for you, such as Database-as-a-Service providers.

    on AWS, Azure, or Google; replica sets (described in detail later in this chapter);
    and **sharded clusters** . These also provide seamless, zero-downtime scaling,
    and high availability via automatic failover.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In MongoDB, there is a feature that ensures high availability using automatic
    failover. In short, failover is a feature that ensures that if a primary server
    (that has the most important copy of your database) fails, then a secondary member's
    database becomes the primary one if the original primary server is unavailable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A secondary member's database is a server that keeps the so-called **read-only
    backup** of your database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary and the secondary databases very often replicate themselves in order
    to be in sync all the time. The secondary server is mostly for read operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This whole replica set feature is quite time-consuming to implement from scratch
    (without mLab), but mLab provides this feature in order to *abstract* this part
    so that our whole process will be more automated.

    As we can see in the preceding screenshot, there are three nodes: the replica''s
    **flip** and **flop** , and an arbiter. In the flip-flop''s demo, you can connect
    to the arbiter server, and the primary server will step down and the cluster will
    failover to the other node. You can experiment with it--try on your own and have
    fun!'

    You can do this by running it with `npm start` , and then you shall see the empty
    home page of the publishing app. Because we moved away from the local database
    and the remote is empty, you need to register a new user and try to publish a
    new article with mLab under the hood to store the data.

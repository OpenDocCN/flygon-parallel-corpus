- en: What is Docker? It's a very useful piece of software that is open source and
    helps you pack, ship, and run any app as a light (in comparison to a virtual machine,
    for example) container.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A container's goals are similar to virtual machines--the big difference is that
    Docker was created with software development in mind, as opposed to VMs. You need
    to also be aware that a fully virtualized system has its own resources allocated
    to it, which causes minimal resource sharing, which is different for Docker containers.
    Of course, in VMs, you get more isolation, but the cost is that the VMs are much
    heavier (requiring more disk space, RAM, and other resources). Docker's containers
    are lightweight and are able to share more things among different containers in
    comparison to VMs.

- en: Generally, Docker's benefits are that it increases developers' productivity,
    helps them ship software faster, helps move the software from local development
    machines to production deployments on AWS, and so on. Docker also allows versioning
    (similar to Git) of your software, which can be helpful when you need a quick
    rollback on the production server.

    capacity located in the Amazon Web Services cloud. In EC2, you don't need to invest
    money upfront in buying any hardware. Everything you pay is for the time spent
    using an EC2 instance. This allows you to deploy applications faster. Very quickly,
    you can add new virtual servers (when there is a bigger web traffic demand). There
    are some mechanisms to scale the number of EC2 instances automatically with the
    use of **AWS CloudWatch** . Amazon EC2 gives you the ability to scale up or down
    to handle changed requirements (such as spikes in popularity)--this feature reduces
    your need to forecast traffic (and saves you time and money).
  prefs: []

    EC2 instances with load balancers and ECS).

    deployed automatically--this means you don't need to log in to any of the EC2

    group of EC2 instances in the exposed port 80 so you are able to find the publishing
    application under the `http://[[EC2_PUBLIC_IP]]` address. Additionally, we are
    adding a load balancer between all the EC2 instances and the rest of the world
    so that in case there is any spike in traffic or any of the EC2 instances break,
    the load balancer will replace the broken EC2 instance with a new one or scale
    down/up the number of EC2 instances based on the traffic.

    with the Docker Container that has the image of our publishing app. This helps

- en: Generally, a service is a mechanism that keeps a certain amount of EC2 instances
    running while checking their health at the same time (using the **Elastic Load
    Balancing** (**ELB** )). ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic
    across multiple Amazon EC2 instances. If a server doesn't respond on port 80 (the
    default but can be changed to more advanced health checks), then the service runs
    a new service while the unhealthy one is being shut down. This helps you maintain
    very high availability for your application.

    is that stubs replace the target function. They also replace the called code with
    custom behavior (replacing it) such as throwing exceptions or returning a value.
    They are also able to call a callback function that has been provided as a parameter.
    Stubs code returns a specified result.

    book, so if you are interested in adding this step to the whole publishing app
    project, there are books related to this as well.

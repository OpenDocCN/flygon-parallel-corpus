    offer the worst performance due to the underlying latency of establishing, using
    and closing streams and sockets. Since PHP is basically a synchronous language
    that waits for a called function to return before resuming code execution, I/O
    calls are especially problematic if the called function has to wait for a stream
    to close before returning to the calling code. This becomes even worse when a
    PHP application has thousands of I/O calls to do every few minutes for example.

    I/O calls that usually have very high latency. In order to better grasp the orders

    of the many I/O calls. This is possible due to non-blocking code that will yield
    control back to the caller code while waiting for some task to complete, and possibly
    call a callback function when done. If we profile the previous code using `Blackfire.io`,

    is actually an invokable object that implements the iterator interface. The underlying

    that will, in turn, yield control back to the loop until there is nothing left
    to process, in which case the generator function will return definitely.

    functions within the same thread. This is what asynchronous programming is all
    about in its essential principle. Indeed, it is easy to understand how multitasking
    can, for example, be used to help mitigate the effects of a heavy workload on
    a single PHP script by interrupting the script's execution in order to queue some
    tasks using third-party software, like RabbitMQ and Redis. Thus, it becomes possible
    to delay the processing of these tasks until such time as processing is deemed
    appropriate.

    latency in I/O calls. In order to accomplish this, we will need a thread-safe

    The lambda function then executes the code that will send the answer back to the
    client by writing it to the accepted stream socket.

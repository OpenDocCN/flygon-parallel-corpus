- en: As we have seen in the previous chapters of this book, I/O calls will always
    offer the worst performance due to the underlying latency of establishing, using
    and closing streams and sockets. Since PHP is basically a synchronous language
    that waits for a called function to return before resuming code execution, I/O
    calls are especially problematic if the called function has to wait for a stream
    to close before returning to the calling code. This becomes even worse when a
    PHP application has thousands of I/O calls to do every few minutes for example.

    can still be useful in speeding up blocking code. This is particularly true for
    I/O calls that usually have very high latency. In order to better grasp the orders

    call a callback function when done. If we profile the previous code using `Blackfire.io`,

    of different parts of the code and thus easier asynchronous programming. A generator
    is actually an invokable object that implements the iterator interface. The underlying
    principle is therefore to have a loop that will repeatedly call a generator function
    that will, in turn, yield control back to the loop until there is nothing left
    to process, in which case the generator function will return definitely.

    functions within the same thread. This is what asynchronous programming is all
    about in its essential principle. Indeed, it is easy to understand how multitasking
    can, for example, be used to help mitigate the effects of a heavy workload on
    a single PHP script by interrupting the script's execution in order to queue some
    tasks using third-party software, like RabbitMQ and Redis. Thus, it becomes possible
    to delay the processing of these tasks until such time as processing is deemed
    appropriate.

- en: '`POSIX Threads`, better known as `pthreads`, is a library that allows a computer
    program to execute multiple processes or threads concurrently by forking child
    processes from its parent process. The `pthreads` library can be used in PHP,
    making it therefore possible to fork processes in the background while executing
    something else simultaneously. Thus, multithreading is another way to cope with
    latency in I/O calls. In order to accomplish this, we will need a thread-safe
    version of PHP with the `pthreads` extension enabled. In our case, we will use
    a Linux for PHP container that is running a **Zend thread-safe** (**ZTS**) version
    of PHP 7.0.29\. Open a new Terminal window, `cd` into the project''s directory

    total elapsed time for the script was 10 seconds even though each thread slept
    for at least a few seconds. If this synchronous blocking code was executed without
    multithreading, it would have taken approximately 40 seconds in all to complete
    execution. Multitasking would not have been an appropriate solution in this case,
    as the blocking calls to the `sleep()` function would have prevented each generator
    from yielding control to the main loop.

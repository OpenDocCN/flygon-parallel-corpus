- en: We will now learn how to query an SQL database efficiently using Modern SQL.
    In this chapter, we will define what Modern SQL is and how to use it. We will
    start by defining the concept of Modern SQL and understanding what makes it different
    from traditional SQL by describing many of its features. Thus, we will acquire
    knowledge of how to convert certain traditional SQL queries into modern ones and
    when it is best to do so. Moreover, by doing so, we will better understand how
    Modern SQL can help us optimize a server's performance in more than one way.

    Modern SQL can be defined as "*an internationally standardized, widely available
    and Turing complete data processing language supporting relational and non-relational
    data models*." This definition refers to a set of standards that were promoted
    by the ISO and ANSI organizations over the years and that added new features to
    the SQL programming language. Since SQL-92, many new versions of the SQL standard
    were adopted and these standards introduced many new features based on relational
    and non-relational models. Here is a short list of these features with the corresponding
    standard that confirmed their adoption into the SQL language:'

    based solely on the relational model promoted by the aging SQL-92 standard. It
    has only been in the most recent years that many, if not most, of RDBMSs have
    started implementing Modern SQL features.

    member which will run with T[i] as input and T[i+1] as output until an empty result

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this recursive CTE was a little slower than the basic multiple join
    query on my computer, it did generate fewer engine operations overall when all
    the selected columns were indexed. So, why is this more performant? A recursive
    CTE will allow you to avoid the hassle of creating a stored procedure, or something
    similar, in order to recursively discover the number of levels in your hierarchy
    tree, for example. This would most certainly make the multiple join query much
    slower if we added these operations to the main query. Also, a recursive CTE might
    be a kind of derived table that is not much quicker than a View and slightly slower
    than a basic multiple join query, but it is certainly very scalable and very useful
    when querying a database in order to walk a hierarchy tree, when using ranking
    functions or when modifying table contents based on a small result subset while
    resting assured that your more complex queries will benefit, for free, from future
    engine optimizations. Moreover, it will make your development cycle more efficient
    as it will make your code more readable to other developers by keeping it **DRY**
    ("**Don't Repeat Yourself**").

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though the `CASE` expression seems to remind us of imperative structures
    such as `IF`, `SWITCH`, and the like, it still does not allow for program flow
    control like those imperative structures, but rather allows for declarative evaluation
    of values based on certain conditions. Let's have a look at the following example
    in order to better understand this feature.
  prefs: []

    the input of the second `COUNT` function as the `CASE` expression applied the
    condition which states that the superior column must not have a `NULL` value in
    order to count the id column. Using this feature of Modern SQL is not, for the
    most part, a question of added performance, but rather a question of avoiding
    stored procedures and controlling execution flows as much as possible, while keeping
    the code clean, easily readable and maintainable.

    done over a set of rows. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not group
    the results though. In order to better understand these two window functions,
    let''s take the time to run the following query in the `phpMyAdmin` web interface:'

- en: As we can see, the result set shows the payroll per manager column without grouping
    the results. This is why we had to use the `DISTINCT` statement in order to avoid
    having multiple rows for the same manager. Obviously, window functions allow for
    efficient querying and optimized performance when doing aggregate calculations
    on subsets of rows that have some sort of relationship to the current row.

    each employee within each subset. And what is the underlying execution plan that
    will allow us to get all these details about these subsets of data? The answer
    is a `SIMPLE` query! In the case of our query, there is a dependent subquery,
    but that is because we are fetching the last name of each manager in order to
    make the result set more interesting.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the underlying `select_type` is once more `SIMPLE` instead of having multiple
    queries united with a `UNION` operator as we would have done before this feature
    existed. Once more, Modern SQL offers us a highly optimized query which will remain
    highly maintainable for many years to come.

    Modern SQL. We have defined what Modern SQL is and how we can use it. We have
    acquired knowledge of how to convert certain traditional SQL queries into modern
    ones and when it is best to do so. Moreover, by doing so, we now better understand
    how Modern SQL can help us optimize a server's performance in more than one way.

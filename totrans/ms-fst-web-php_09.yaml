    was shifting from offering more and more features to users, even if these were
    slow, to offering features that were not incompatible with web performance. Google's

- en: In 2009, Google announced it would start to find ways to update the HTTP protocol
    by making use of a new session protocol named SPDY (`SPeeDY`). This new session
    protocol worked over an underlying TLS presentation layer and allowed for many
    HTTP speed optimizations at the application layer. Using SPDY was as easy as activating
    SSL, installing the `mod_spdy` module on your web server and activating it. No
    modifications to the websites were needed in order to benefit from its features.
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moreover, all major browsers were supporting it. SPDY rapidly became a core
    element of the Faster Web and became, in November 2012, the basis of the next
    major revision of the HTTP protocol. Then, in 2015, it was deprecated in favor
    of the new HTTP/2 protocol. The most important optimizations that were introduced
    by SPDY and that would find their way into the new HTTP protocol's specifications
    were multiplexed and prioritized streams, server pushing and header compression.
    Let's have a look at each one of these optimizations in more detail before we
    get into some of the specifics of the HTTP/2 protocol.

    multiple streams on a single connection. These streams were bidirectional and
    could be initiated by either the client or the server (the server push feature).
    Opening multiple streams over one single connection made it possible to avoid
    the overhead of establishing a new connection on each client/server exchange,
    especially when downloading multiple resources in parallel to complete the rendering
    of a single page. Thus, this first feature made it possible to get rid of the
    limited number of possible connections when using the HTTP/1 protocol:'

    the often high number of HTTP headers and reducing them by as much as 85% of their
    original sizes on average, SPDY could cut up to a full second off the load time
    of most HTTP transactions over the wire. Although the use of `gzip` to dynamically
    compress the headers was revealed to be unsafe, the idea of header compression
    remained and was re-implemented in the HTTP/2 protocol due to its great benefits
    to overall web performance.

    the HTTP protocol. It is mostly based on Google's SPDY protocol and offers a new
    binary framing layer that is not backward-compatible with HTTP/1\. As mentioned
    previously, most of its features were developed through the SPDY project. The
    most notable difference between SPDY and HTTP/2 was the way that the new protocol
    compressed its headers. Whereas SPDY relied on dynamically compressing headers
    with `gzip`, the HTTP/2 protocol used a new method named `HPACK`, which made use
    of a fixed Huffman code-based algorithm. This new method was needed in order to
    avoid a problem that was found with SPDY, by which data compression led to the
    possible leakage of private data.

    much as two times, many critics voiced their disappointment by pointing out that
    the unrealistic deadlines imposed by Google on the project of updating the HTTP
    protocol made it impossible to base the new version of the protocol on anything
    else but its SPDY project and, thus, causing many missed occasions for further
    improvement of the new HTTP protocol. *Poul-Henning Kamp*, developer of *Varnish
    Cache*, even went on to say that HTTP/2 was inconsistent and that it was overly
    and needlessly complex. Moreover, he stated that it had violated the principle
    of protocol layering by duplicating flow control that should normally take place
    at the transport layer [2]. Finally, many security flaws were found in this new
    protocol, the most notable ones being those unveiled by the cybersecurity firm
    Imperva at the Black Hat USA 2016 conference [3]. These were the slow read attack,
    the dependency cycle attack, the stream multiplexing abuse and the HPACK Bomb.
    Essentially, all these attack vectors could be used to bring a server offline
    by submitting it to a **Denial of Service** (**DoS**) attack or by saturating
    its memory.

    run much more secure, much faster and more reliable PHP code on web servers. Before
    PHP-FPM, the default way to run PHP code on a web server was usually through the
    `mod_php` module. What makes PHP-FPM so interesting is the possibility for it
    to adapt itself to the number of incoming requests and spawn new processes in
    a pool of workers in order to scale to the growing demand. Moreover, running PHP
    this way allows for better script termination, more graceful server restarts,
    more advanced error reporting and server logging, and fine-grained tuning of the
    PHP environment for each and every PHP pool of workers through the daemonization
    of the PHP binary.

    in a production environment, you might decide to run PHP-FPM with many pools of
    workers on many servers in order to distribute the workload. Moreover, you might
    prefer running PHP-FPM through a UNIX socket on the server rather than on the
    network loopback (`127.0.0.1`) for performance and security reasons. Indeed, a
    UNIX socket is always faster in any scenario and will offer better security against
    a local network attacker, that could always try to compromise the loopback with
    a socket listener using domain autorizations, by enforcing appropriate access

    This form of HTTP caching focuses on reducing the number of requests needed to
    render a page in order to avoid network latency as much as possible. Indeed, large
    responses often need many roundtrips over the network. HTTP client-side caching
    tries to minimize the number of these requests in order to complete the page''s
    rendering. Nowadays, all major browsers offer support for these techniques and
    enabling these technologies on your website is as easy as sending a few additional
    headers or using library files that are already available on **Content Delivery
    Networks** (**CDNs**). Let''s have a look at these two techniques: browser caching
    headers and CDNs.'

  zh: 浏览器缓存
- en: Browser caching is based on the idea that it is not necessary to fetch all the
    files included in a response if some of these are exactly the same over a certain
    period of time. The way it works is through headers that are sent by the server
    to the browser in order to instruct it to avoid getting certain pages or files
    within a certain timeframe. Thus, the browser will display content kept within
    its cache rather than fetching the resources over the network within the span
    of that certain period of time, or until the resource changes.
  id: totrans-110
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 浏览器缓存的基本思想是，如果在一定时间内某些文件完全相同，就不必获取响应中包含的所有文件。它的工作方式是通过服务器发送给浏览器的头部，以指示浏览器在一定时间内避免获取某些页面或文件。因此，浏览器将显示保存在其缓存中的内容，而不是在一定时间内通过网络获取资源，或者直到资源发生变化。
- en: Thus, browser caching relies on cache-control evaluation (expiration model)
    and response validation (validation model). Cache-control evaluation is defined
    as a set of directives that inform the browser of who can cache the response,
    under what circumstances and for how long. Response validation relies on a hash
    token in order to determine if the content of a response has changed or not. It
    also makes it possible for the browser to avoid fetching the results again even
    if cache-control indicates that the cached content has expired. In fact, upon
    receiving the response from the server indicating that the content has not been
    modified, based on the fact that the sent token has not changed on the server,
    the browser simply renews the cache-control and resets the time delay before expiration.
  id: totrans-111
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因此，浏览器缓存依赖于缓存控制评估（过期模型）和响应验证（验证模型）。缓存控制评估被定义为一组指令，它们告知浏览器谁可以缓存响应，在什么情况下以及多长时间。响应验证依赖于哈希令牌，以确定响应的内容是否已更改。它还使浏览器能够避免再次获取结果，即使缓存控制指示缓存的内容已过期。实际上，收到来自服务器的响应，指示内容未被修改，基于发送的令牌在服务器上未更改的事实，浏览器只需更新缓存控制并重置到期前的时间延迟。
- en: 'This is accomplished through the use of certain response headers. These are
    **Cache-Control** and **ETag** headers. Here is an example of these received headers
    within a response:'
  id: totrans-112

    sets an **ETag** with value **"e4563ff"**. With these two headers, the browser
    will be able to manage its cache adequately. Thus, enabling browser caching is
    as easy as adding those response headers to the responses returned by the web
    server. In the case of *Apache*, it is a simple question of making sure that the
    FileETag directive was added to the server's configuration file.
  id: totrans-114
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在这个例子中，Cache-Control指示**最大年龄**为**120**秒，并设置了值为**"e4563ff"**的**ETag**。有了这两个头部，浏览器就能够充分管理其缓存。因此，启用浏览器缓存就像将这些响应头部添加到Web服务器返回的响应中一样简单。对于*Apache*来说，只需确保FileETag指令已添加到服务器的配置文件中即可。

    including CSS and JavaScript libraries, downloadable objects, such as files and
    software, and live-streaming or on-demand streaming media. CDNs can therefore
    be used as a sort of internet common cache. Indeed, by using a CDN to host all
    of your library files, you are combining browser HTTP caching with HTTP Reverse
    Proxy caching. This means that if another website or web application is using
    the same library files as you, your user's browser will either use its cached
    versions of the libraries or submit a request to refresh the files to a CDN and
    not your web server. This not only reduces network latency by reducing the number
    of requests needed globally to render the same content, but also takes away a
    part of the workload from your web server by delegating the responsibility of
    refreshing expired browser caches to the CDN's Reverse Proxy cache.

- en: As we can see, the list of optimization suggestions is much shorter, but if
    we were to leverage browser caching for certain specific image files that can
    be found on the site, eliminate some render-blocking JavaScript and CSS, reduce
    image sizes and try to reduce server response time in general, we would most certainly
    get a perfect score!

  zh: 正如我们所看到的，优化建议的列表要短得多，但如果我们利用浏览器缓存特定的图像文件，消除一些阻塞渲染的JavaScript和CSS，减小图像大小，并尝试减少服务器响应时间，我们肯定会得到一个完美的分数！

  zh: 总结
- en: In this chapter, we have covered a few projects that went along with *Google*'s
    new initiative of a Faster Web. We have seen what the HTTP/2 protocol is all about
    and how the SPDY project made it possible, how PHP-FPM and Zend OPCache can help
    you boost the performance of your PHP scripts, how to use ESI technology by setting
    up a Varnish Cache server, how to use client-side caching, and how other Faster
    Web tools can help you out when trying to optimize your web server's performance.

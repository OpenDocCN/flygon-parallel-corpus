- en: If there's one thing that's said more than anything else about the Go language,
    it's that "*Go is a server language*."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly, Go was built to be an ideal server language, designed as a next-generation
    iteration over the expanses and/or over-engineering of C, C++, and Java.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The language has evolved—largely with fervent community support—to go far beyond
    servers into system tools, graphics, and even compilers for new languages. At
    its heart, however, Go is made for powerful, concurrent, and easy-to-deploy cross-platform
    servers. This is what makes the language ideal for this book's topic.

    web services and APIs that can scale for production, with emphasis on security,
    scalability, and adherence to RESTful principles.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book, we'll build a rudimentary API for a social network, which will
    allow us to demonstrate and dive deeper into some fundamental concepts, such as
    connecting Go to other services and keeping your server secure and highly available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you should be experienced with all the relevant instances
    to build a robust, scalable, secure, and production-ready web service.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Our First API in Go"), *Our First API in
    Go*, quickly introduces—or reintroduces—some core concepts related to Go setup
    and usage as well as the `http` package.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. RESTful Services in Go"), *RESTful Services
    in Go*, focuses on the guiding principles of the REST architecture and translates
    them into our overall API design infrastructure.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Routing and Bootstrapping"), *Routing and
    Bootstrapping*, is devoted to applying the RESTful practices from the previous
    chapter to built-in, third-party, and custom routers for the scaffolding of our
    API.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Designing APIs in Go"), *Designing APIs in
    Go*, explores overall API design while examining other related concepts, such
    as utilization of web sockets and HTTP status codes within the REST architecture.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Templates and Options in Go"), *Templates
    and Options in Go*, covers ways to utilize the `OPTIONS` request endpoints, implementing
    TLS and authentication, and standardizing response formats in our API.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Accessing and Using Web Services in Go"),
    *Accessing and Using Web Services in Go*, explores ways to integrate other web
    services for authentication and identity in a secure way.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Working with Other Web Technologies"), *Working
    with Other Web Technologies*, focuses on bringing in other critical components
    of application architecture, such as frontend reverse proxy servers and solutions,
    to keep session data in the memory or datastores for quick access.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Responsive Go for the Web"), *Responsive
    Go for the Web*, looks at expressing the values of our API as a consumer might,
    but utilizing frontend, client-side libraries to parse and present our responses.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Deployment"), *Deployment*, introduces deployment
    strategies, including utilization of processes to keep our server running, highly
    accessible, and interconnected with associated services.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Maximizing Performance"), *Maximizing Performance*,
    stresses upon various strategies for keeping our API alive, responsive, and fast
    in production. We look at caching mechanisms that are kept on disk as well as
    in memory, and explore ways in which we can distribute these mechanisms across
    multiple machines or images.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Security"), *Security*, focuses more on
    best practices to ensure that your application and sensitive data are protected.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use the examples in this book, you can utilize any one of a Windows, Linux,
    or OS X machine, though you may find Windows limiting with some of the third-party
    tools we'll be using.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll obviously need to get the Go language platform installed. The easiest
    way to do this is through a binary, available for OS X or Windows at [URL]. Go
    is also readily available via multiple Linux package managers, such as yum or
    aptitude.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The choice of the IDE is largely a personal issue, but we recommend Sublime
    Text, which has fantastic Go support, among other languages. We'll spend a bit
    more time detailing some of the pros and cons of the other common IDEs in [Chapter
    1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Our First API in Go"), *Our First API in Go*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll utilize quite a few additional platforms and services, such as MySQL,
    MongoDB, Nginx, and more. Most should be available across platforms, but if you're
    running Windows, it's recommended that you consider running a Linux platform—preferably
    an Ubuntu server—on a virtual machine to ensure maximum compatibility.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for developers who are experienced in both Go and server-side
    development for web services and APIs. We haven't spent any time on the basics
    of programming in Go, so if you're shaky on that aspect, it's recommended that
    you brush up on it prior to diving in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The target reader is comfortable with web performance at the server level, has
    some familiarity with REST as a guiding principle for API design, and is at least
    aware of Go's native server capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't anticipate that you'll be an expert in all the technologies covered,
    but fundamental understanding of Go's core library is essential, and general understanding
    of networked server architecture setup and maintenance is ideal.

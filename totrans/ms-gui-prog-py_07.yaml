- en: It is easy to appreciate the clean, native look that Qt effortlessly provides
    by default. But for less business-like applications, plain gray widgets and bog-standard
    fonts don't always set the right tone. Even the drabbest utility or data entry
    application occasionally benefits from the addition of icons or the judicious
    tweaking of fonts to enhance usability. Fortunately, Qt's flexibility allows us
    to take the look and feel of our application into our own hands.

    property, which we can either set in the constructor or by using the `setFont()`
    accessor. The value of `font` must be a `QtGui.QFont` object.

    array of identically named fonts, this would be all you'd need to know about `QFont`.
    Unfortunately, that isn't the case. Most systems ship with only a handful of fonts
    built-in and only a few of these are universal across platforms or even different
    versions of a platform. Therefore, Qt has a fallback mechanism for dealing with
    missing fonts.

    but, for simply displaying a picture in your GUI, the most appropriate is `QPixmap`.
    `QPixmap` is a display-optimized image class, which can load many common image
    formats including PNG, BMP, GIF, and JPEG.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason why `QPixmap` objects are so limited is that they are actually stored
    in the display server's memory. The `QImage` class is similar but stores data
    in application memory, so that it can be edited more extensively. We'll explore
    this class more in [Chapter 12](1a25e80a-2680-47f4-b309-782cf9b8580f.xhtml), Creating

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: By specifying a size in the constructor and using the `fill()` method, we can
    create a simple, colored rectangle pixmap. This is useful for displaying color
    swatches or to use as a quick-and-dirty image stand-in.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now consider an icon on a toolbar or in a program menu. When the menu item is
    disabled, you expect the icon to be grayed out in some way. Likewise, if a user
    hovers over the button or item using a mouse cursor, you might expect it to be
    highlighted. To encapsulate this type of state-dependent image display, Qt provides
    the `QIcon` class. A `QIcon` object contains a collection of pixmaps that are
    each mapped to a widget state.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE14]'

    `QPixmap` object to a widget state. These states include `Normal`, `Active`, `Disabled`,
    and `Selected`.

    in the submit button until the `Server` field contains data, at which point it
    automatically switches to green. Notice that we don't have to tell the icon object
    itself to switch states; once assigned to the widget, it tracks any changes in
    the widget's state.
  prefs: []

    the `QComboBox`, `QListView`, `QTableView`, and `QTreeView` items; and most other

    using palette, brush, and color objects may seem verbose and unintuitive. Fortunately,
    Qt offers you an alternative known as QSS, which is very similar to the **Cascading
    Style Sheets** (**CSS**) used in web development. It is an easy way to apply some
    simple changes to our widgets.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well, when you add a QSS style to a widget class, the style change carries down
    to all its subclasses. Since we styled `QWidget`, all the other `QWidget` derived
    classes (such as `QCheckbox` and `QPushButton`) inherited this style.

    general case. For example, our `QPushButton` background color overrides the `QWidget`
    background color.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note the use of colons with `QCheckBox`—the double colon in QSS allows us to
    reference a subelement of a widget. In this case, this is the indicator portion
    of the `QCheckBox` class (as opposed to its label portion). We can also use a
    single colon to reference a widget state, as, in this case, we're setting a different
    style depending on whether or not the checkbox is checked or unchecked.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    any developer who has worked with web development; however, it does have some
    disadvantages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: QSS is an abstraction over the palette and style objects and must be translated
    to the actual system. This makes them slower for large applications, and it also
    means that there is no default style sheet that you can retrieve and edit – you're
    starting from scratch each time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we've already seen, QSS can have unpredictable results when applied to high-level
    widgets, since it inherits through the class hierarchy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, bear in mind that QSS is a modest subset of CSS 2.0 with a few additions
    or changes—it is not CSS. Therefore, transitions, animations, flexbox containers,
    relative units, and other modern CSS goodies are completely absent. So, while
    web developers may find its basic syntax familiar, the limited set of options
    may be frustrating and its different behaviors confusing.

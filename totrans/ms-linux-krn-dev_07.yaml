    frames** that hold local variables and function parameters; a new frame is created
    on top of the stack upon entry into a called function, and is destroyed when the
    current function returns. Depending on the level of nesting of the function calls,
    there is always a need for the stack segment to dynamically expand to accommodate
    new frames. Such expansion is handled by the virtual memory manager through **page
    faults**: when the process attempts to touch an unmapped address at the top of
    the stack, the system triggers a page fault, which is handled by the kernel to
    check whether it is appropriate to grow the stack. If the current stack utilization
    is within `RLIMIT_STACK`, then it is considered appropriate and the stack is expanded.
    However, if the current utilization is maximum with no further scope to expand,
    then a segmentation fault signal is delivered to the process.'

    faults. Hacker programs are generally hard-coded with fixed start addresses of
    memory segments of a valid process; with address space randomization, such malicious
    attacks would fail. However, text segments enumerated from the binary file of
    the application program are mapped to a fixed address as per the definition of
    the underlying architecture; this is configured into the linker script, which
    is applied while constructing the program binary file.

    a large number of regions are mapped into the list. As a workaround, the VM subsystem

    them through a descriptor of type `struct anon_vma`. This structure enables quick
    access to all of the process VMAs that map anonymous pages; the `*anon_vma` pointer

    regions of the parent. The memory manager would need to locate and track all VMAs
    that refer to the same regions for it to be able to support unmap and swap-out
    operations. As a solution, the VM subsystem uses another descriptor called `struct
    anon_vma_chain` that links all `anon_vma` structures of a process group. The `anon_vma_chain`

    by the VMA is inactive, the system triggers a page fault exception, and the function

    that are similar to memory, such as nvrams, flash storage, and other persistent
    memory devices. Drivers for such storage devices are implemented to perform all
    read and write operations directly on storage, without any caching. When a user
    process attempts to map a file from a DAX storage device, the underlying disk
    driver directly maps the corresponding file pages to process the virtual address
    space. For optimal performance, user-mode processes can map large files from DAX
    storage by enabling `VM_HUGETLB`. Due to the large page sizes supported, page
    faults on DAX file maps cannot be handled through regular page fault handlers,
    and filesystems supporting DAX need to assign appropriate fault handlers to the
    `*pmd_fault()` pointer of the VMA.

    The root node of the tree is located in `mm->mm_rb.rb_node`. Through the helper
    function `rb_entry()`, each node is verified for the address within the virtual
    address interval of the VMA. If the target VMA with a lower start address and
    higher end address than the specified address is located, the function returns
    the address of the VMA instance. If the appropriate VMA is still not found, the
    search continues its lookup into the left or right child nodes of the `rbtree`.

    between the possible tags, and the second contains a sufficient number of elements
    of unsigned longs so that there is a bit for each page that can be organized in
    the node. Following is the list of tags supported:'

- en: All access operations on process virtual address regions are put through address
    translation before reaching the appropriate physical memory regions. The VM subsystem
    maintains page tables to translate linear page addresses into physical addresses.
    Even though the page table layout is architecture specific, for most architectures,
    the kernel uses a four-level paging structure, and we will consider the x86-64
    kernel page table layout for this discussion.

- en: Each of the page table structures can support 512 records, of which each record
    provides the base address of the next-level page structure. During translation
    of a given linear address, MMU extracts the top 9 bits containing the index into
    the page global directory (PGD), which is then added to the base address of PGD
    (found in cr3); this lookup results in the discovery of the base address for page
    upper directory (PUD). Next, MMU retrieves the PUD offset (9 bits) found in the
    linear address, and adds it to the base address of PUD structure to reach the
    PUD entry (PUDE) that yields the base address of page middle directory (PMD).
    The PMD offset found in the linear address is then added to the base address of
    PMD to reach the relevant PMD entry (PMDE), which yields the base address of the
    page table. The page table offset (9 bits) found in the linear address is then
    added to the base address discovered from the PMD entry to reach the page table
    entry (PTE), which in turn yields the start address of the physical frame of the
    requested data. Finally, the page offset (12 bits) found in the linear address
    is added to the PTE discovered base address to reach the memory location to be
    accessed.

- en: In this chapter, we focused on specifics of virtual memory management with respect
    to process virtual address space and memory maps. We discussed critical data structures
    of the VM subsystem, memory descriptor structure (`struct mm_struct`), and VMA
    descriptor (`struct vm_area_struct`). We looked at the page cache and its data
    structures (`struct address_space`) used in reverse mapping of file buffers into
    various process address spaces. Finally, we explored the page table layout of
    Linux, which is widely used in many architectures. Having gained a thorough understanding
    of filesystems and virtual memory management, in the next chapter, we will extend
    this discussion into the IPC subsystem and its resources.

    not very granular. With an ACL, we can allow only a certain person to access a
    file or directory, or we can allow multiple people to access a file or directory
    with different permissions for each person. If we have a file or a directory that's
    wide open for everyone, we can use an ACL to allow different levels of access
    for either a group or an individual. Towards the end of the chapter, we'll put
    what we've learned all together in order to manage a shared directory for a group.

    the list of permissions that we want to grant to this user. In this case, we're
    only allowing Maggie read access. We complete the command by listing the file
    to which we want to apply this ACL. The `getfacl` output shows that Maggie does
    indeed have read access. Finally, we see in the `ls -l` output that the group
    is listed as having read access, even though we've set the `600` permissions setting
    on this file. But, there's also a `+` sign, which tells us that the file has an
    ACL. When we set an ACL, the permissions for the ACL show up as group permissions

- en: There may be times when you'll want all files that get created in a shared directory
    to have the same access control list. We can do that by applying an inherited
    ACL to the directory. Although, understand that, even though this sounds like
    a cool idea, creating files in the normal way will cause files to have the read/write
    permissions set for the group, and the read permission set for others. So, if
    you're setting this up for a directory where users just create files normally,
    the best that you can hope to do is to create an ACL that adds either the write
    or execute permissions for someone. Either that, or ensure that users set the
    `600` permissions settings on all files that they create, assuming that users
    really do need to restrict access to their files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, if you're creating a shell script that creates files in a
    specific directory, you can include `chmod` commands to ensure that the files
    get created with the restrictive permissions that are necessary to make your ACL
    work as intended.

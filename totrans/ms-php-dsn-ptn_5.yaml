    that is lacking in technical knowledge), without their code being agile enough
    to withstand code. In these scenarios, when a code is added, it is often botched
    into place and it will almost certainly be the case that the code takes far longer
    to implement than it would without technical debt. This leads to a slow development
    speed.

    is set in stone. These processes are often unjustifiable but developers often
    follow them as they aren't educated in better processes, don't want to enter a
    bureaucratic dispute to alter them, or may even fear disciplinary action for attempting
    to improve a process.
  id: totrans-18

    when you're not dealing with a legacy project, this can become a problem due to
    the change of requirements throughout a property. A good property of software
    is the ability to change and, indeed, change the design of the software itself
    (we'll discuss this in the final chapter on refactoring).

    pre-defined production-line process. Humans are unpredictable, and when they are
    the key actor in any given process, the process also becomes unpredictable. Humans
    are open to error and don't act perfectly in a pre-defined process when there
    is as much room for error as there is in software development. Fundamentally,
    this is why people must come before processes, as stated in the Agile manifesto.
    The developers must come before the process.

    hire a consultant who fails to understand how software development can really
    be made a success, and instead, implements a ridiculous process as part of a cash
    cow operation to sell Agile. I believe that Scrum is the worst example of this
    (in part because of the number of inaccurate courses and pseudo-qualifications),
    but no doubt other Agile processes can be used as cash cows.

    and as such, people must come above processes.

    in cases where an abstraction has two aspects, with one dependent on the other.
    In addition to this, it is very useful when a change to object requires changes
    to the others and you don't know how many other objects need to be changed. Finally,
    this pattern is also incredibly useful when an object should notify other objects
    without making assumptions about what those objects are, thus making this pattern
    great for loosely coupling this relationship.

  zh: 四人帮最初确定这种模式特别适用于抽象有两个方面，其中一个依赖于另一个的情况。除此之外，当对象的更改需要对其他对象进行更改，而你不知道需要更改多少其他对象时，这种模式也非常有用。最后，当一个对象应该通知其他对象而不做出关于这些对象是什么的假设时，这种模式也非常有用，因此这种模式非常适用于松散耦合的关系。

- en: The main advantage of this design pattern surrounds the loosely coupled nature
    of the relationships between the observers and the subjects. There is greater
    modularity, as subjects and observers can independently vary. In addition to this,
    we can add as many observers as we want, providing as many pieces of functionality
    as we're after. This extensibility and customization is often the reason this
    design pattern is applied in the context of view for an application and is also
    often implemented in **Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**) frameworks.
  id: totrans-57
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这种设计模式的主要优势在于观察者和主题之间关系的松散耦合性。有更大的模块化，因为主题和观察者可以独立变化。除此之外，我们可以添加任意多的观察者，提供我们想要的任意多的功能。这种可扩展性和定制性通常是这种设计模式应用于应用程序视图上下文的原因，也经常在**模型-视图-控制器**（**MVC**）框架中实现。
- en: The disadvantages of using this pattern come when we need to debug this whole
    thing; flow control can become difficult as observers don't know about each other.
    In addition to this, there is an update overhead, which can make memory management
    difficult when dealing with particularly large observers.
  id: totrans-58
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 使用这种模式的缺点在于当我们需要调试整个过程时会出现问题；流程控制可能会变得困难，因为观察者彼此之间并不知道对方的存在。除此之外，还存在更新开销，当处理特别大的观察者时，可能会使内存管理变得困难。
- en: Remember that this design pattern is solely for use within one program, it's
    not designed for inter-process communication or a messaging system. Later in this

- en: The Iterator design pattern is where an iterator is used to traverse a container.
    In PHP, a class is traversable using the `foreach` construct if it ultimately
    inherits the Traversable interface. Unfortunately, this is an abstract base interface,
    you can't implement it alone (unless you're writing in the PHP core itself). Instead,
    you must instead implement interfaces called `Iterator` or `IteratorAggregate`.
    By implementing either of these interfaces you make a class iterable and traversable
    using `foreach`.

  zh: 迭代器设计模式是使用迭代器遍历容器的地方。在PHP中，如果最终继承了可遍历接口，类就可以使用`foreach`构造进行遍历。不幸的是，这是一个抽象基础接口，你不能单独实现它（除非你是在PHP核心中编写）。相反，你必须实现称为`Iterator`或`IteratorAggregate`的接口。通过实现这些接口中的任何一个，你可以使一个类可迭代，并可以使用`foreach`进行遍历。
- en: '`Iterator` and `IteratorAggregate` interfaces are very similar, except the

- en: PHP has a great mechanism to create iterators in a compact fashion. This type
    of iterator comes with some severe limitations; they are forward only and cannot
    be rewound. Indeed, even to simply start an iterator from the start, you must
    rebuild the generator. In essence, this is a forward-only iterator.
  id: totrans-106
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: PHP有一个很好的机制来以紧凑的方式创建迭代器。这种类型的迭代器有一些严重的限制；它们只能向前，不能倒带。事实上，即使只是从头开始一个迭代器，你也必须重新构建生成器。本质上，这是一个只能向前的迭代器。
- en: A function that uses the `yield` keyword instead of the `return` keyword. This
    will act in the same way as a `return` statement, but it will not stop the execution
    of that function. A generator function can `yield` data as many times as you please.

- en: When you populate an array with values, those values must be stored in memory
    which can cause you to exceed your PHP memory limit or require a significant amount
    of processing time for the generator. When you put the logic in a generator function,

    results as it needs; there's no need to prepopulate an array first.

  zh: 当您用值填充一个数组时，这些值必须存储在内存中，这可能导致您超出PHP内存限制，或者需要大量的处理时间来生成器。当您将逻辑放在生成器函数中时，这种开销就不存在了。生成器函数可能只产生它需要的结果；不需要先预先填充一个数组。

- en: Developing, deploying, and operating cloud applications should be as easy as
    local applications. This should be the governing principle behind any cloud platform,
    library, or tool. Spring Cloud makes it easy to develop JVM applications for the
    cloud. In this book, we introduce you to Spring Cloud and help you master its
    features.

- en: You will learn to configure the Spring Cloud server and run the Eureka server
    to enable service registration and discovery. Then you will learn about techniques
    related to load balancing and circuit breaking and utilize all the features of
    the Feign client. We then dive into advanced topics where you will learn to implement
    distributed tracing solutions for Spring Cloud and build message-driven microservice
    architectures.

- en: This book appeals to developers keen to take advantage of Spring Cloud, an open
    source library which helps developers quickly build distributed systems. Knowledge
    of Java and Spring Framework will be helpful, but no prior exposure to Spring
    Cloud is required.

- en: '[Chapter 1](33ddbb93-e658-4d91-97f5-06d6167ef89e.xhtml), *Introduction to Microservices*,
    will introduce you to the microservices architecture, cloud environment, etc.
    You will learn the difference between a microservice based application and a monolith
    application while also learning how to migrate to a microservices application.'

    will introduce you Spring Boot framework. You will learn how to effictively use
    it to create microservice application.  We will cover such topics like creating
    REST API using Spring MVC annotations, providing API documentation using Swagger2,
    and exposing health checks and metrics using Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.'

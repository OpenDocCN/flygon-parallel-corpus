- en: Microservices are one of the hottest trends to emerge in the IT world during
    the last few years. It is relatively easy to identify the most important reasons
    for their growing popularity. Both their advantages and disadvantages are well
    known, although what we describe as disadvantages can be easily solved using the
    right tools. The advantages that they offer include scalability, flexibility,
    and independent delivery; these are the reasons for its rapidly growing popularity. There
    are a few earlier IT trends that had some influence over this growth in the popularity
    of microservices. I'm referring to trends such as the usage of common cloud-based
    environments and the migration from relational databases to NoSQL.

    that divides an application into a collection of loosely coupled services that
    implement business requirements. In fact, this is a variant of the concept of **service-oriented
    architecture** (**SOA**). One of the most important benefits of a migration to

- en: By now, you have probably had an opportunity to read some books or articles
    about microservices. I think that most of them would have given you a detailed
    description of their advantages and drawbacks. There are many advantages to using
    microservices. The first is that microservices are relatively small and easy to
    understand for a new developer in a project. We usually want to make sure that
    the change in the code performed in one place would not have an unwanted effect
    on all the other modules of our application. With microservices, we can have more
    certainty about this because we implement only a single business area, unlike
    monolithic applications where sometimes even seemingly unrelated functionalities
    are put in the same boat. That is not all. I have noticed that, usually, it is
    easier to maintain expected code quality in small microservices than in a large
    monolith where many developers have introduced their changes.

  zh: 到目前为止，你可能已经有机会阅读一些关于微服务的书籍或文章。我认为其中大多数都会给你详细描述它们的优点和缺点。使用微服务有许多优点。首先，微服务相对较小，对于项目中的新开发人员来说比较容易理解。我们通常希望确保在一个地方进行的代码更改不会对我们应用程序的所有其他模块产生不良影响。有了微服务，我们可以更加确定，因为我们只实现了一个业务领域，而不像单片应用程序，有时甚至看似无关的功能也被放在同一个船上。这还不是全部。我注意到，通常在小的微服务中更容易维护预期的代码质量，而在大型单体中，许多开发人员都引入了他们的更改。
- en: The second thing I like about microservices architecture concerns division.
    Until now, when I had to deal with complex enterprise systems, I always saw that
    dividing the system into subsystems was done according to other subsystems. For
    example, telecommunication organizations always have a billing subsystem. Then
    you create a subsystem that hides the billing complexity and provides an API.
    Then you find out that you need data that can't be stored in the billing system
    because it is not easily customizable. So you create another subsystem. This leads
    in effect to you building a complicated subsystem mesh, which is not easy to understand,
    especially if you are a new employee in the organization. With microservices,
    you do not have problems such as this. If they are well-designed, every microservice
    should be responsible for an entire selected area. In some cases, those areas
    are similar regardless of the sector in which an organization is active.

  zh: 我喜欢微服务架构的第二件事是关于分工。直到现在，当我不得不处理复杂的企业系统时，我总是看到将系统划分为子系统是根据其他子系统来完成的。例如，电信组织总是有一个计费子系统。然后你创建一个隐藏计费复杂性并提供API的子系统。然后你发现你需要的数据无法存储在计费系统中，因为它不容易定制。所以你创建另一个子系统。这实际上导致你构建了一个复杂的子系统网格，这不容易理解，特别是如果你是组织中的新员工。有了微服务，你就不会遇到这样的问题。如果它们设计得很好，每个微服务应该负责一个完整的选定领域。在某些情况下，这些领域是相似的，无论组织活跃在哪个行业。

- en: Microservices are intrinsically linked to cloud-computing platforms, but the
    actual concept of microservices is nothing new. This approach has been applied
    in the IT development world for many years, but now, through the popularity of
    cloud solutions, it has evolved to a higher level. It is not hard to point out
    the reasons for this popularity. The use of a cloud offers you scalability, reliability,
    and low maintenance costs in comparison with on-premises solutions inside the
    organization. This has led to the rise of cloud-native application development
    approaches that are intended to give you the benefits from all of the advantages
    offered by cloud-like elastic scaling, immutable deployments, and disposable instances.
    It all comes down to one thing—decreasing the time and cost that is needed to
    meet new requirements. Today, software systems and applications are being improved
    continuously. If you have a traditional approach to development, based on monoliths,
    a code base grows and becomes too complex for modifications and maintenance. Introducing
    new features, frameworks, and technologies becomes hard, which in turn impacts
    innovations and inhibits new ideas. We can't argue with that.

    Certainly not. Those who are not absolutely sure about migrating their applications
    to a remote cloud provider, such as AWS, Azure, or Google, would like to at least
    have an on-premises private cloud or Docker containers. But will it really bring
    them the benefits that compensate for expenses incurred? It is worth answering
    that question before looking at cloud-native development and cloud platforms.

    The client expects a solution, but does not want the development to require the
    redeployment of the whole application. It should be scalable and should easily
    be able to extend new modules and functionalities. Additionally, the client does
    not put pressure on the developer to use Oracle or another relational database—not
    only that, but he would be happy to avoid using it. Are these sufficient reasons
    to decide on migrating to microservices? Let's just assume that they are. We divide
    our monolithic application into four independent microservices, each one of them
    with a dedicated database. In some cases, it can still be a relational database,
    while in others it can be a NoSQL database. Now, our system consists of many services
    that are independently built and run in our environment. Along with an increase
    in the number of microservices, there is a rising level of system complexity.
    We would like to hide that complexity from the external API client, which should
    not be aware that it talks to service *X* but not *Y*. The gateway is responsible
    for dynamically routing all requests to different endpoints. For example, the
    word *dynamically* means that it should be based on entries in the service discovery,
    which I'll talk about later in the section *Understanding the need for service
    discovery*.

  zh: 一致性不再是最重要的要求；甚至不是强制性的。客户期望有一个解决方案，但不希望开发需要重新部署整个应用程序。它应该是可扩展的，并且应该能够轻松地扩展新的模块和功能。此外，客户并不会对开发人员施加使用Oracle或其他关系数据库的压力——不仅如此，他很乐意避免使用它。这些足够的理由决定迁移到微服务吗？让我们假设它们是。我们将我们的单片应用程序分成了四个独立的微服务，每个微服务都有一个专用的数据库。在某些情况下，它仍然可以是关系数据库，而在其他情况下，它可以是NoSQL数据库。现在，我们的系统由许多独立构建和在我们的环境中运行的服务组成。随着微服务数量的增加，系统复杂性水平也在上升。我们希望将这种复杂性隐藏在外部API客户端之外，外部API客户端不应该知道它与服务*X*交谈而不是*Y*。网关负责动态路由所有请求到不同的端点。例如，*动态*一词意味着它应该基于服务发现中的条目，我将在后面的*理解服务发现的需求*部分中讨论。

    by these devices on a computer network. In the case of microservice-based architecture,
    this is the necessary mechanism. Every service after startup should register itself
    in one central place that is accessible by all other services. The registration
    key should be the name of a service or an identificator, which has to be unique
    within the whole system in order to enable others to find and call the service
    using that name. Every single key with the given name has some values assigned
    to it. In the most common cases, these attributes indicate the network location
    of the service. To be more accurate, they indicate one of the instances of the
    microservice because it can be multiplied as independent applications running
    on different machines or ports. Sometimes it is possible to send some additional
    information, but it depends on the concrete service discovery provider. However,
    the important thing here is that under the one key, more than one instance of
    the same service may be registered. In addition to registration, each service
    gets a full list of the other services registered on the particular discovery
    server. Not only that, every microservice must be aware of any changes in the
    registration list. This may be achieved by periodically renewing the configuration
    earlier collected from the remote server.

    web service. Before startup, every microservice tries to connect to the server
    and get the parameters prepared especially for it. One of the approaches stores
    such a configuration in the version control system—for example, Git. Then the
    configuration server updates its Git working copy and serves all properties as
    a JSON. In another approach, we can use solutions that store key-value pairs and

    Of course, there could be more, but we'll keep it low for performance reasons.
    Anyway, multiple instances of the same service make it necessary to use load balancing
    for incoming requests. Firstly, the **load balancer** is usually built into an
    API gateway. This load balancer should get the list of registered instances from
    the discovery server. If there is no reason not to, then we usually use a round-robin
    rule that balances incoming traffic 50/50 between all running instances. The same

    can use some other interaction styles, which, of course, apply not only to microservices-based
    architecture. The first categorization that should be performed is one-to-one
    or one-to-many communication. In one-to-one interaction, every incoming request
    is processed by exactly one service instance while, in one-to-many, it is processed
    by multiple service instances. But the most popular division criterion is whether
    the call is synchronous or asynchronous. Additionally, asynchronous communication
    can be divided into notifications. When a client sends a request to a service,
    but a reply is not expected, it can just perform a simple asynchronous call, which
    does not block a thread and replies asynchronously.

  zh: 大多数人一听到微服务，就认为它由具有JSON表示的RESTful web服务组成，但这只是其中一种可能性。我们可以使用其他交互方式，当然，这不仅适用于基于微服务的架构。应该进行的第一个分类是一对一或一对多的通信。在一对一交互中，每个传入请求都由一个服务实例处理，而在一对多交互中，它由多个服务实例处理。但最流行的划分标准是调用是同步还是异步。此外，异步通信可以分为通知。当客户端向服务发送请求，但不需要回复时，它可以执行简单的异步调用，不会阻塞线程，并以异步方式回复。
- en: Furthermore, it is worth mentioning reactive microservices. Now, from version
    5, Spring also supports this type of programming. There are also libraries with
    Reactive support for interaction with NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB or Cassandra.
    The last well-known communication type is publish-subscribe. This is a one-to-many
    interaction type where a client publishes a message that is then consumed by all
    listening services. Typically, this model is realized using message brokers, such
    as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ.

    for failures are totally beyond the control of the holder, such as network or
    database problems. Such errors can be particularly severe for microservice-based
    systems, where one input request is processed in many subsequent calls. The first
    good practice is to always use network timeouts when waiting for a response. If

  zh: 我们已经讨论了与微服务架构相关的大部分重要概念。诸如服务发现、API网关和配置服务器等机制是有用的元素，帮助我们创建可靠高效的系统。即使在设计系统架构时考虑了许多这些方面，你也应该时刻准备好应对故障。在许多情况下，故障的原因完全超出持有者的控制，如网络或数据库问题。这些错误对基于微服务的系统尤为严重，因为一个输入请求会在许多后续调用中被处理。第一个良好的实践是在等待响应时始终使用网络超时。如果单个服务出现性能问题，我们应该尽量减少对其他部分的影响。最好发送错误响应，而不是长时间等待回复，阻塞其他线程。
- en: An interesting solution for the network timeout problems might be the **circuit
    breaker pattern**. It is a concept closely related to the microservice approach.
    A circuit breaker is responsible for counting successful and failed requests. If
    the error rate exceeds an assumed threshold, it trips and causes all further attempts
    to fail immediately. After a specific period of time, the API client should get
    back to sending requests, and if they succeed, it closes the circuit breaker.
    If there are many instances of each service available and one of them works slower
    than others, the result is that it is overlooked during the load balancing process.
    The second often-used mechanism for dealing with partial network failures is **fallback**.
    This is a logic that has to be performed when a request fails. For example, a
    service can return cached data, a default value, or an empty list of results.
    Personally, I'm not a big fan of this solution. I would prefer to propagate error
    code to other systems than return cached data or default values.

  zh: 网络超时问题的一个有趣解决方案可能是**断路器模式**。这个概念与微服务方法密切相关。断路器负责计算成功和失败的请求。如果错误率超过设定的阈值，它就会跳闸，导致所有后续尝试立即失败。在特定时间后，API客户端应该恢复发送请求，如果成功，就关闭断路器。如果每个服务有很多实例可用，其中一个运行速度比其他慢，结果就是在负载平衡过程中被忽略。处理部分网络故障的第二种常用机制是**回退**。这是请求失败时必须执行的逻辑。例如，服务可以返回缓存数据、默认值或空结果列表。就个人而言，我不太喜欢这个解决方案。我更愿意将错误代码传播给其他系统，而不是返回缓存数据或默认值。

  zh: 总结
- en: The big advantage of Spring Cloud is that it supports all the patterns and mechanisms
    we have looked at. These are also stable implementations, unlike some other frameworks.
    I'll describe in detail which of the patterns are supported by which Spring Cloud
    project in [Chapter 3](5e461bca-a37d-4f72-b58f-5f14694d055f.xhtml), *Spring Cloud
    Overview*.

  zh: Spring Cloud的一个重大优势是它支持我们所看到的所有模式和机制。这些也是稳定的实现，不像一些其他框架。我将在[第3章](5e461bca-a37d-4f72-b58f-5f14694d055f.xhtml)中详细描述Spring
    Cloud项目支持哪些模式。
- en: In this chapter, we have discussed the most important concepts related to microservices
    architecture, such as cloud-native development, service discovery, distributed
    configuration, API gateways, and the circuit breaker pattern. I have attempted
    to present my point of view about the advantages and drawbacks of this approach
    in the development of enterprise applications. Then, I described the main patterns
    and solutions related to microservices. Some of these are well-known patterns
    that have been around for years and are treated as something new in the IT world.
    In this summary, I would like to turn your attention to some things. Microservices
    are cloud-native by their nature. Frameworks such as Spring Boot and Spring Cloud
    help you to accelerate your cloud-native development. The main motivation of migrating
    to cloud-native development is the ability to implement and deliver applications
    faster while maintaining high quality. In many cases, microservices help us to
    achieve this, but sometimes the monolithic approach is not a bad choice.

  zh: 在本章中，我们讨论了与微服务架构相关的最重要的概念，如云原生开发、服务发现、分布式配置、API网关和断路器模式。我试图阐述我对这种方法在企业应用开发中的优势和缺点的观点。然后，我描述了与微服务相关的主要模式和解决方案。其中一些是长期存在并被视为IT世界的新事物的众所周知的模式。在这个总结中，我想引起你的注意。微服务天生就是云原生的。诸如Spring
    Boot和Spring Cloud之类的框架可以帮助你加速云原生开发。迁移到云原生开发的主要动机是能够更快地实现和交付应用程序，同时保持高质量。在许多情况下，微服务可以帮助我们实现这一点，但有时单片机的方法也不是一个坏选择。
- en: Although microservices are small and independent units, they are managed centrally.
    Information such as network location, configuration, logging files, and metrics
    should be stored in one central place. There are various types of tools and solutions
    that provide all these features. We will talk about them in detail in almost all
    of the chapters in this book. The Spring Cloud project is designed to help us
    in integrating with all that stuff. I hope to efficiently guide you through the
    most important integrations it offers.

  zh: 尽管微服务是小而独立的单元，但它们是集中管理的。诸如网络位置、配置、日志文件和指标等信息应该存储在一个集中的地方。有各种类型的工具和解决方案提供所有这些功能。我们将在本书的几乎所有章节中详细讨论它们。Spring
    Cloud项目旨在帮助我们整合所有这些东西。我希望能够有效地指导你了解它提供的最重要的集成。

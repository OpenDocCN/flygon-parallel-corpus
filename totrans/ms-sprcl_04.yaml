    previous chapters. In fact, it is one of the most popular technical aspects of
    microservice architecture. Such a subject could not have been omitted from the
    Netflix OSS implementation. They did not decide to use any existing tool with
    similar features, but designed and developed a discovery server especially for
    their own needs. Then, it had been open sourced along with several other tools.
    The Netflix OSS discovery server is known as **Eureka**.

- en: The Spring Cloud library for integration with Eureka consists of two parts,
    the client side and the server side. The server is launched as a separate Spring
    Boot application and exposes an API that allows for the collection of a list of
    registered services and adding a new service with a location address. The server
    can be configured and deployed to be highly available, with each server replicating
    its state with the others. The client is included in the microservice application
    as a dependency. It is responsible for the registration after startup, the deregistration
    before shutdown, and for keeping the registration list up to date by polling the
    Eureka Server.

    analyzed only a system with a single service discovery server. Such a configuration
    is valid, but only in development mode. For production mode, we would like to
    have at least two discovery servers running in case one of them fails or a network
    problem occurs. Eureka is by definition built for availability and resiliency,
    two primary pillars of development at Netflix. But it does not provide standard
    clustering mechanisms such as leadership election or automatically joining to
    the cluster. It is based on the peer-to-peer replication model. It means that
    all of the servers replicate data and send heartbeats to all of the peers, which
    are set in configuration for the current server node. Such an algorithm is simple
    and effective for containing data, but it also has some drawbacks. It limits scalability,
    because every node has to withstand the entire write load on the server.

    work on the new version of the Eureka Server. Eureka 2.0 is still under active
    development. Besides optimized replication, it will also provide some interesting
    features such as a push model from the server to clients for any changes in the
    registration list, auto-scaled servers, and a rich dashboard. This solution seems
    promising, but Spring Cloud Netflix still uses version 1 and to be honest I was
    not able to find any plans for the migration to version 2\. The current Eureka
    version for Dalston.SR4 Release Train is 1.6.2\. The configuration of the clustering
    mechanism on the server side comes down to one thing, the set URL of another discovery
    server using `eureka.client.*` properties section. The selected server would just
    register itself in the other servers, which were chosen to be a part of the created
    cluster. The best way to show how this solution works in practice is of course
    by example.

    most cases, but not always enough. Eureka has one more interesting feature that
    can be very useful in a clustered environment. A zone mechanism is, in fact, the
    default behavior. Even if we have a single standalone service discovery instance,
    every client''s property has to be set to `eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone`
    in the configuration settings. When will this be useful to us? To analyze it,
    we go back to the example from the previous section. Let''s imagine that now we
    have our environment divided into three different physical networks, or we just
    have three different machines processing the incoming requests. Of course, discovery
    services are still grouped logically in the cluster, but each instance is placed
    in a separated zone. Every client application would be registered in the same
    zone as its main discovery server. Instead of one instance of the Zuul gateway,
    we are going to launch three instances, each one for a single zone. If the request
    comes into a gateway, it should prefer those clients that leverage services within
    the same zone before trying to call services registered in another zone. The current
    system architecture is visualized in the following diagram. Of course, for example
    purposes, the architecture was simplified to be able to run on a single local
    machine. In the real world, like I mentioned before, it would be launched on three
    different machines or even on three different groups of machines, physically separated

    to implement service discovery properly. Starting with the simplest use cases
    and examples, we have been going through advanced and production-ready features
    provided by the Netflix OSS Eureka project. I have shown you how to create and
    run a basic client and a standalone discovery server in *five minutes*. Based
    on that implementation, I have introduced how to customize the Eureka client and
    server to meet our specific needs, placing the emphasis on negative scenarios
    such as network or application failure. Such features as the REST API or UI dashboard
    have been discussed in detail. Finally, I have shown you how to create a production-ready
    environment using Eureka's mechanisms such as replication, zones, and high availability.
    With that knowledge, you should be able to choose those features of Eureka through
    which you build a service discovery adapted to the specifics of your microservice-based
    architecture.

    and configuration services are usually based on key/value stores, so they may

    discovery, Spring Cloud introduces their own framework for managing distributed
    configurations, Spring Cloud Config.

    of a Storm cluster.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Each of the nodes in the cluster can run one or more JVMs called **worker processes**,
    which are responsible for processing a part of the topology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A worker process is specific to one of the specific topologies and can execute
    multiple components of that topology. If multiple topologies are being run at
    the same time, none of them will share any of the workers, thus providing some
    degree of isolation between topologies.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the topology. Each of these threads is called an **executor**. An executor can
    execute only one of the components, that is, any spout or bolt in the topology.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    serially. The number of executors defined for a spout or bolt can be changed dynamically
    while the topology is running, which means that you can easily control the degree

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When defining a topology, we create a graph of computation with the number of
    bolt-processing streams. At a more granular level, each bolt executes multiple
    tasks in the topology. Thus, each task of a particular bolt will only get a subset
    of the tuples from the subscribed streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stream grouping in Storm provides complete control over how this partitioning
    of tuples happens among the many tasks of a bolt subscribed to a stream. Grouping
    for a bolt can be defined on the instance of `org.apache.storm.topology.InputDeclarer`
    returned when defining bolts using the `org.apache e.storm.topology.TopologyBuilder.setBolt`
    method.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shuffle grouping
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Shuffle grouping distributes tuples in a uniform, random way across the tasks.
    An equal number of tuples will be processed by each task. This grouping is ideal
    when you want to distribute your processing load uniformly across the tasks and
    where there is no requirement for any data-driven partitioning. This is one of
    the most commonly used groupings in Storm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Field grouping
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This grouping enables you to partition a stream on the basis of some of the
    fields in the tuples. For example, if you want all the tweets from a particular
    user to go to a single task, then you can partition the tweet stream using field
    grouping by username in the following manner:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: As a result of the field grouping being *hash (fields) % (no. of tasks)*, it
    does not guarantee that each of the tasks will get tuples to process. For example,
    if you have applied a field grouping on a field, say *X*, with only two possible
    values, *A* and *B*, and created two tasks for the bolt, then it might be possible
    that both *hash (A) % 2* and *hash (B) % 2* return equal values, which will result
    in all the tuples being routed to a single task and the other being completely
    idle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another common usage of field grouping is to join streams. Since partitioning
    happens solely on the basis of field values, and not the stream type, we can join
    two streams with any common join fields. The name of the fields needs not be the
    same. For example, in the order processing domain, we can join the `Order` stream
    and the `ItemScanned` stream to see when an order is completed:'

    them to all the tasks, that is, each tuple will be sent to each of the bolt's
    tasks for processing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One common use case of all grouping is for sending signals to bolts. For example,
    if you are doing some kind of filtering on the streams, you can pass or change
    the filter parameters to all the bolts by sending them those parameters over a
    stream that is subscribed by all the bolt's tasks with an all grouping. Another
    example is to send a reset message to all the tasks in an aggregation bolt.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global grouping does not partition the stream but sends the complete stream
    to the bolt's task, the smallest ID. A general use case of this is when there
    needs to be a reduce phase in your topology where you want to combine the results
    from previous steps in the topology into a single bolt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global grouping might seem redundant at first, as you can achieve the same results
    by defining the parallelism for the bolt as one if you only have one input stream.
    However, when you have multiple streams of data coming through a different path,
    you might want only one of the streams to be reduced and others to be parallel
    processes.

    For example, say we have a log stream and we want to process each log entry to
    be processed by a specific bolt task on the basis of the type of resource. In
    this case, we can use direct grouping.
  prefs: []

    a direct stream, use the `backtype.storm.topology.OutputFieldsDeclarer.declareStream`
    method, which takes a `boolean` parameter. Once you have a direct stream to emit
    to, use `backtype.storm.task.OutputCollector.emitDirect` instead of emit methods
    to emit it. The `emitDirect` method takes a `taskId` parameter to specify the
    task. You can get the number of tasks for a component using the `backtype.storm.task.TopologyContext.getComponentTasks`

    a `messageId` argument. Storm uses this message ID to track the state of the tuple
    tree generated by this tuple. If you use one of the emit methods that doesn't
    take a `messageId` argument, Storm will not track it for complete processing.
    When the message is processed completely, Storm will send an acknowledgement with
    the same `messageId` that was used while emitting the tuple.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A generic pattern implemented by spouts is that they read a message from a messaging
    queue, say RabbitMQ, produce the tuple into the topology for further processing,

    of processing a message, for example, **bolt B** in the preceding topology, then
    it should emit the new tuple anchored with the original tuple that it got from
    the spout. This can be done by using the overloaded emit methods in the `org.apache.storm.task.OutputCollector`
    class that takes an anchor tuple as an argument. If you are emitting multiple
    tuples from the same input tuple, then anchor each outgoing tuple.
  prefs:

    bolt, send an acknowledgment using the `org.apache.storm.task.OutputCollector.ack`

    the message as being processed and dequeue it from the message queue, if any.

    the time interval you configure for tick tuples is, in practice, served on a best-effort
    basis. For instance, if a bolt is suffering from high execution latency--for example,

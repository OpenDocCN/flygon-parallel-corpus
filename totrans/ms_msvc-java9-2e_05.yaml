    *Implementing a Microservice*. We'll add a few more services to groom our online
    table reservation system (OTRS) application that only depends on three functional
    services (Restaurant, User, and Booking services) and Eureka (service discovery
    and registration) to create a fully functional microservice stack. This stack
    will have gateway (Zuul), load balancing (Ribbon with Zuul and Eureka), and monitoring
    (Hystrix, Turbine, and the Hystrix dashboard). You want to have composite APIs
    and see how one microservice talks to others. This chapter will also explain how
    to containerize microservices using Docker and how to run multiple containers
    together using `docker-compose`. On top of this, we'll also add the integration
    tests.

- en: Load balancing is required to service requests in a manner that maximizes speed
    and capacity utilization, and it makes sure that no server is overloaded with
    requests. The load balancer also redirects requests to the remaining host servers
    if a server goes down. In microservice architecture, a microservice can serve
    internal or external requests. Based on this, we can have two types of load balancing—client-side
    and server-side load balancing.

    It is important to define the routing mechanism for our OTRS application from
    the microservice architecture point of view. For example, `/` (root) could be
    mapped to our UI application. Similarly, `/restaurantapi` and `/userapi` could
    be mapped to the Restaurant service and User service respectively. The edge server
    also performs routing with load balancing.

    the routes defined in `application.yml` to call internal services and provide

    gateway responsibility for internal networks, and calls internal services for
    defined and configured routes.

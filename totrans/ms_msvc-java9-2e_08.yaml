- en: Now, after developing the microservices, it would be interesting to see how
    the services offered by the **online table reservation system** (**OTRS**) could
    be consumed by web or mobile applications. We will develop the web application
    (UI) using AngularJS/Bootstrap to build the prototype of the web application.
    This sample application will display the data and flow of this sample project—a
    small utility project. This web application will also be a sample project and
    will run independently. Earlier, web applications were being developed in single
    web archives (files with `.war` extensions) that contained both UI and server-side
    code. The reason for doing so was pretty simple, as UI was also developed using
    Java with JSPs, servlets, JSF, and so on. Nowadays, UIs are being developed independently
    using JavaScript. Therefore, these UI apps also deploy as a single microservice.
    In this chapter, we'll explore how these independent UI applications are being
    developed. We will develop and implement the OTRS sample app without login and
    authorization flow. We'll deploy a very limited functionality implementation and
    cover the high-level AngularJS concepts. For more information on AngularJS, you
    can refer to *AngularJS by Example*, *Chandermani*, *Packt Publishing*.

    common uses of services—organizing code and sharing code across applications.
    Services are singleton objects, which are lazily instantiated by the AngularJS
    service factory. We have already seen a few of the built-in AngularJS services
    such as `$injector`, `$log`, and so on. AngularJS services are prefixed with the

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The AngularUI team built UI-Router, an AngularJS routing framework. UI-Router
    is not a part of core AngularJS. UI-Router not only changes the route URL, but
    it also changes the state of the application when the user clicks on any link
    in the SPA. Because UI-Router can also make state changes, you can change the
    view of the page without changing the URL. This is possible because of the application
    state management by the UI-Router.

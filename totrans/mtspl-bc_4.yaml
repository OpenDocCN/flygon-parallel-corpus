    part of a law enforcement agency. However, in a conventional penetration test,
    persistence may not be very practical, unless the testable environment is huge
    and will take many days for the test to complete. But this doesn't mean that it
    is not worth knowing how to maintain access to the target. In the following section,
    we will cover persistence techniques, which one can use to maintain access to
    the target system. In addition, Metasploit has depreciated the persistence and
    `metsvc` modules in meterpreter, which were used to maintain access to the target.
    Let's cover the new techniques for achieving persistence.

    `background` command and use the latest persistence module, which is `post/windows/manage/persistence_exe`.
    The beauty of this module is that it is not Metasploit dependent, which means
    that you can use any executable to achieve persistence on it. Let''s put it to
    `use` and run a quick `show options` to check all the options we need to set,

    that will be loaded onto the victim system. REXEPATH is the path of the executable
    on our system that will be uploaded to the target, and will be renamed as the
    value set on REXENAME. The SESSION option will contain the session identifier
    of the meterpreter through which the file will be uploaded to the target. The
    STARTUP option will contain one of the values from USER, SYSTEM, SERVICE. We will
    keep USER in the STARTUP option in the case of a limited access user; the persistence
    will be achieved on the login of that particular user only. Achieving persistence
    on any user login can be obtained by setting the value of STARTUP to SYSTEM. However,
    to achieve persistence at SYSTEM level, administrator privileges will be required,
    and the same would be the case for a SERVICE install. As a result, we will keep
    it as USER only.

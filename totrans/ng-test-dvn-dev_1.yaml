    starting development. One common approach is to work off a specification. A documented
    approach may help in defining what needs to be built; however, without tangible
    criteria for how to meet a specification, the actual application that gets developed
    may be completely different from the specification. With a TDD approach, every
    stage of the process verifies that the result meets the specification. Think about
    how a tailor continues to use a measuring tape to verify the suit throughout the
    process.

    is no need to actually implement the multiplication logic. This may seem unintuitive.
    The point is that once a passing test exists, it should always pass. When a method
    contains fairly complex logic, it is easier to run a passing test against it to
    ensure that it meets the expectations.
  prefs: []

    the expected value of `9`, the test should pass. Although this won't add the multiply

    the test, making future changes will be easy as we have to simply keep the test
    passing!

    the ability to create assertions/expectations, the ability to use test doubles,
    and a lot more. This book uses Jasmine as the test framework. Jasmine is a behavior-driven
    testing framework. It is highly compatible with testing Angular applications.

- en: This chapter provided an introduction to TDD. It discussed the TDD life cycle
    (test first, make it run, and make it better) and these steps can be used by anybody
    for TDD approach similar to how we have saw being used by a tailor. Finally, it
    looked over some of the testing techniques that will be discussed throughout this
    book, including test doubles, refactoring, and building patterns.

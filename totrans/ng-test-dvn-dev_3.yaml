    on real browsers. Traditionally, tests were run by launching a browser manually
    and checking for results by continually clicking on the refresh button. This method
    was awkward and often resulted in developers limiting the number of tests that
    were written.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Karma, a developer can write a test in almost any standard test framework,
    choose a browser to run against, set the files to watch for changes, and bam!
    We have continuous automated testing. We have to simply check the output window
    for failed or passed tests.

  prefs: []

- en: Remember that Karma is a test runner, not a test framework. Its job is to run
    tests and report which tests will pass or fail. Why is this helpful? A test framework
    is where you will write your tests. Apart from doing this, you will need to be
    focused on running the tests easily and seeing the results. Karma easily runs
    tests across several different browsers. It also has some other features, such
    as file watching, which will be discussed in detail later in the book.

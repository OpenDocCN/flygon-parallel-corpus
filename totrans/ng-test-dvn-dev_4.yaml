    of every piece of code. However, when it comes to testing the flow and feature
    of any component, module, or full application, then **end-to-end** (**e2e**) testing
    is the only solution.

    all the layers of an application. We will be introduced to Protractor, the end-to-end
    testing tool from the Angular team. We already know the reason behind it, why
    it was created, and what kind of problems it solves.

    what end-to-end testing is.

    "Chapter 2. Details of JavaScript Testing"), *Details of JavaScript Testing*.
    But let''s have a quick recap:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: End-to-end testing is testing an application against all the interconnected
    moving parts and layers of an application. This differs from unit tests, where
    the focus is on individual components, such as classes, services, and directives.
    With end-to-end testing, the focus is on how the application or a module, as a
    whole, works, such as confirming that the click of a button triggers x, y, and
    z actions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Protractor allows the end-to-end testing of any module or even any size of web
    application by interacting the DOM elements of that application. It offers the
    ability to select a specific DOM element, share the data with that element, simulate
    the click of a button, and interact with an application in the same way as a user
    would. It then allows expectations to be set based on what the user would expect.

- en: Core of Protractor
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a quick overview, we got a basic idea about Protractor--how it needs to select
    DOM elements and interact with them just like a real user would in order to run
    an e2e test on any application. To do these activities, Protractor provides some
    global functions; some are from its core API, and some are from WebDriver. We
    will discuss them in detail in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Protractor, a
    Step Ahead"), *Protractor, a Step Ahead*.

    global object from WebDriver that is mostly used to interact with the application
    browser where the application is running during the e2e test process. It provides
    some useful methods to interact with, as follows:'

    used to find a single element based on the locator, but it supports multiple element
    selection as well, by chaining another method, `.all` as `element.all`, which
    also takes `Locator` and returns `ElementFinderArray`. Let''s have a look at an
    `element` example:'

    unit with any action method calls.Let''s have a look at few of action''s example:'

- en: This chapter gave us an overview of end-to-end testing with Protractor and also
    provided the necessary idea to install, configure, and apply end-to-end testing
    with an existing Angular project. Protractor is an important part of testing any
    Angular application. It bridges the gap to ensure that a user's specifications
    work as expected. When end-to-end tests are written according to user specifications,
    the confidence of the application and ability to refactor grows. In the upcoming
    chapters, we will see how to apply Karma and Protractor in more depth with simple
    and straightforward examples.

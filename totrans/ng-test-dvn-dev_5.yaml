    but a good developer should know the advanced features of Protractor to perform
    large-scale application testing. Besides that, debugging is kind of a challenge
    in e2e testing as it depends on the DOM element of the browser.

- en: The main activities of an e2e test for any web page are to get the DOM elements
    of that page, interact with them, assign an action to them, and share information
    with them; then, the user can get the current state of the website. To enable
    us to perform all these actions, Protractor provides a wide array of APIs (some
    are from the web driver). In this chapter, we will look at some commonly used
    APIs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous chapter, we saw how Protractor works with an Angular project,
    where we had to interact with UI elements. For that, we used a few Protractor
    APIs, such as `element.all`, `by.css`, `first`, `last`, and `getText`. However,
    we didn't see or understand the workings of these APIs in depth. To understand
    the workings of APIs in Protractor is very simple, but in real life we will mostly
    have to work with bigger, complex projects. Hence, it's important that we understand
    and know more about these APIs in order to interact with the UI and play with
    its events.

    than using `browser.pause()`. With the `browser.pause()` command, we can pause
    the control flow of the test and inject the custom helper functions into the browser
    so that debugging happens in the same way as we would debug in a browser console.

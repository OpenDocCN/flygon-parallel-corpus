- en: Before we start building more complicated features for our LOB app, LemonMart,
    we need to ensure that every code push we create has passing tests, adheres to
    the coding standards, and is an executable artifact that team members can run
    tests against, as we continue to further develop our application. Simultaneously,
    we need to start thinking about how our application will communicate with a backend
    server. Whether you, your team, or another team will be creating the new APIs,
    it will be important that the API design accommodates the needs of both the frontend
    and backend architectures. To ensure a smooth development process, a robust mechanism
    is needed to create an accessible, living piece of documentation for the API.
    **Continuous Integration** (**CI**) can solve the first problem and Swagger is
    perfect to address API design, documentation, and testing needs.

- en: Continuous Integration is critical to ensuring a quality deliverable by building
    and executing tests on every code push. Setting up a CI environment can be time
    consuming and requires specialized knowledge of the tool being used. CircleCI
    is an established, cloud-based CI service with a free tier and helpful articles
    to get you started with as little configuration as possible. We will go over a
    Docker-based approach that can be run on most CI services, keeping your specific
    configuration knowledge relevant and CI service knowledge down to a minimum.

- en: Another aspect of full-stack development is that you will likely be developing
    the frontend and backend of your application around the same time. Whether you
    work by yourself, as a team, or with multiple teams, it is critical to establish
    a data contract to ensure that you won't run into eleventh-hour integration challenges.
    We will use Swagger to define a data contract for a REST API and then create a
    mock server that your Angular application can make HTTP calls to. For backend
    development, Swagger can act as a great starting point to generate boilerplate
    code and can go forward as living documentation and testing UI for your API.

    to build, test, and generate deployable artifacts of your application with every
    code push. Before a pushing code, a developer should have a reasonable expectation
    that their build will pass; therefore creating a reliable CI environment that
    automates commands that developers can also run in their local machines is paramount.

- en: In order to ensure a consistent build environment across various OS platforms,
    developer machines, and Continuous Integration environments, you may containerize
    your build environment. Note that there are at least half-a-dozen common CI tools
    currently in use. Learning the ins and outs of each tool is almost an impossible
    task to achieve. Containerization of your build environment is an advanced concept
    that goes above and beyond of what is currently expected of CI tools. However,
    containerization is a great way to standardize over 90% of your build infrastructure,
    and can be executed in almost any CI environment. With this approach, the skills
    you learn and the build configuration you create becomes far more valuable, because
    both your knowledge and the tools you create become transferable and reusable.

- en: There are many strategies to containerize your build environment with different
    levels of granularity and performance expectations. For the purpose of this book,
    we will focus on reusability and ease of use. Instead of creating a complicated,
    interdependent set of Docker images that may allow for more efficient fail-first
    and recovery paths, we will focus on a single and straightforward workflow. Newer
    versions of Docker have a great feature called multi-stage builds, which allow
    you to define a multi image process in an easy-to-read manner and maintain a singular `Dockerfile`.

    container. I have chosen to do that for the sake of keeping the sample simple,
    because it works the same way in both local and remote continuous integration
    environments. However, your CI server will already have a copy of the source code,
    which you'll want to copy from your CI environment and then into the container.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of the `RUN git clone $GIT_REPO .` command, you can copy source code
    with the `COPY $SRC_CODE_LOCATION .` command from your CI server or your local
    machine. If you do this, you will have to implement a `.dockerignore` file that
    somewhat resembles your `.gitignore` file to ensure that secrets aren't leaked,
    `node_modules` is not copied and the configuration is repeatable in other environments.
    In a CI environment, you will want to override the environment variable `$SRC_CODE_LOCATION` so
    that the source directory of the `COPY` command is correct. Feel free to create
    multiple versions of the `Dockerfile` that may fit your various needs.

    This image is about ten times smaller than `node`. The size of Docker images have
    a real impact on build times, since the CI server or your team members will spend
    extra time pulling a larger image. Choose the environment that best fits your

    environment. We leveraged CircleCI as a cloud-based CI service and highlighted
    the fact that you can deploy the outcome of your builds to all major cloud hosting
    providers. If you enable such automated deployment, you will achieve **Continuous Deployment**
    (**CD**). With a CI/CD pipeline, you can share every iteration of your app with
    clients and team members and quickly deliver bug fixes or new features to your
    end users.

    as a tool that is beneficial to frontend and backend developers alike to define
    and develop against a live data-contract. If you create a Swagger mock server,
    you can enable team members to pull the mock server image and use it to develop
    their frontend applications before backend implementation is completed.

    The techniques mentioned in this chapter are straightforward on purpose, but they

    of such tools. You can improve upon the efficiency and the capability of this
    technique vastly, but the techniques will depend on your specific needs.

- en: Designing a high-quality authentication and authorization system without frustrating
    the end user is a difficult problem to solve. Authentication is the act of verifying
    the identity of a user, and authorization specifies the privileges a user has
    to access a resource. Both processes, auth for short, must seamlessly work in
    tandem to address the needs of users with varying roles, needs, and job functions.
    In today's web, users have a high baseline level of expectations from any auth
    system they encounter through the browser, so this is a really important part
    of your application to get absolutely right the first time.

- en: The user should always be aware of what they can and can't do in your app. If
    there are errors, failures, or mistakes, the user should be clearly informed as
    to why such an error occured. As your application grows, it is easy to miss all
    the ways an error condition could be triggered. Your implementation should be
    easy to extend or maintain, otherwise this basic backbone of your application
    will require a lot of maintenance. In this chapter, we will walk-through the various
    challenges of creating a great auth UX and implement a solid baseline experience.

    the authentication and authorization experience of LemonMart. In [Chapter 7](b35a976c-1709-4f43-9c4e-1cf957e7ca6c.xhtml),
    *Create a Router-First Line-of-Business App*, we defined user roles, finished
    our build-out of all major routing and completed a rough walking-skeleton navigation
    experience of LemonMart, so we are well prepared to implement role-based routing
    and the nuances of pulling such an implementation.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A well-designed authentication workflow is stateless so that there's no concept
    of an expiring session. User's are free to interact with your stateless REST APIs
    from as many devices and tabs as they wish, simultaneously or overtime. **JSON
    Web Token** (**JWT**) implements distributed claims-based authentication that
    can be digitally signed or integration protected and/or encrypted using a **Message
    Authentication Code** (**MAC**). This means once a user's identity is authenticated
    through, let's say a password-challenge, they receive an encoded claim ticket
    or a token, which can then be used to make future requests to the system without
    having to reauthenticate the identity of a user. The server can independently
    verify the validity of this claim and process the requests without requiring any
    prior knowledge of having interacted with this user. Thus, we don't have to store
    session information regarding a user, making our solution stateless and easy to
    scale. Each token will expire after a predefined period and due to their distributed
    nature, they can't be remotely or individually revoked; however, we can bolster
    real-time security by interjecting custom account and user role status checks
    to ensure that the authenticated user is authorized to access server-side resources.

- en: A good authorization workflow enables conditional navigation based on a user's
    role so that users are automatically taken to the optimal landing screen; they
    are not shown routes or elements that are not suitable for their roles and if
    by mistake they try to access an authorized path, they're prevented from doing
    so. You must remember that any client-side role-based navigation is merely a convenience
    and is not meant for security. This means that every call made to the server should
    contain the necessary header information, with the secure token, so that the user
    can be reauthenticated by the server, their role independently verified and only
    then they are allowed to retrieve secured data. Client-side authentication can't
    be trusted, which is why password reset screens must be built with a server-side
    rendering technology so that both the user and the server can verify that the
    intended user is interacting with the system.

    at-rest with a secure two-way encryption algorithm. Following this layered approach

    to check whether the user authenticated, but a further database call is required

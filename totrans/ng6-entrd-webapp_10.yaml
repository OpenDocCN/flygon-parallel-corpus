    the router-first approach, I will demonstrate the creation of reusable routable components
    that also support data binding - the ability to lay out components using auxiliary
    routes of the router, using resolve guards to reduce boilerplate code and leveraging
    class, interfaces, enums, validators, and pipes to maximize code reuse. In addition,
    we will create multi-step forms and implement data tables with pagination, and
    explore responsive design. Along the way, in this book, we will have touched upon
    most of the major functionality that Angular and Angular Material has to offer.

    want to continue using interfaces when passing data around various components
    and services. However, there's a need to create a default object to initialize
    a `BehaviorSubject`. In **Object-oriented Programming** (**OOP**), it makes a
    lot of sense for the `User` object to own this functionality instead of a service.
    So, let's implement a `User` class to achieve this goal.

    For the sake of keeping our cache up to date, we subscribe to `currentUser` changes in
    the `constructor`. Additionally, we subscribe to `authStatus`, so when the user
    loads their own profile, `getProfile` can perform a `GET` call using the authenticated
    user's `userId`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, we provide a `getUser` function separately and publicly so that
    the manager can load details of other user profiles, which will be needed when
    we implement a master/detail view later in the chapter. Finally, `updateUser`
    accepts an object that implements the `IUser` interface, so the data can be sent
    to a `PUT` endpoint. It is important to highlight that you should always stick
    to interface and not concrete implementations like `User`, when passing data around.
    This is the D in SOLID – the Dependency Inversion Principle. Depending on concrete
    implementations creates a lot of risk, because they change a lot, whereas an abstraction
    such as `IUser` will seldom change. After all, would you solder a lamp directly

    components into different layouts. Auxiliary routes are routes that are independent
    of each other where they can render content in named outlets that have been defined
    in the markup, such as `<router-outlet name="master">` or `<router-outlet name="detail">`.
    Furthermore, auxiliary routes can have their own parameters, browser history,
    children, and nested auxiliaries.

- en: In this chapter, we completed going over all major Angular app design considerations,
    along with recipes, to be able to implement a line-of-business app with ease.
    We talked about applying object-oriented class design to make hydrating or serializing
    data easier. We created reusable components that can be activated by the router
    or embedded within another component with data binding. We showed that you can
    `POST` data to the server and cache responses. We also created a rich multistep
    input forms that is responsive to changing screen sizes. We removed boilerplate
    code from components by leveraging a resolve guard to load user data. We then
    implemented a master/detail view using auxiliary routes and demonstrated how to
    build data tables with pagination.

- en: Overall, by using the router-first design, architecture, and implementation
    approach, we approached our application's design with a good high-level understanding
    of what we wanted to achieve. Also, by identifying reuse opportunities early on,
    we were able to optimize our implementation strategy to implement reusable components
    ahead of time without running the risk of grossly over-engineering our solution.

    exercises to prepare us for building an amazing app with NativeScript for Angular.
    We want to give you some insights into a few important and powerful concepts to
    think about as you plan your architecture, to pave your way to a smooth development
    experience with scalability in mind.

- en: Combining Angular with NativeScript provides a wealth of useful paradigms and
    tools to construct and plan your app. As often said, with great power comes great
    responsibility, and as awesome as this tech combination is to create amazing apps,
    they can also be used for creating an overengineered and difficult to debug app.
    Let's take a few chapters to walk through some exercises you can use to help avoid
    common pitfalls and truly unlock the full potential of this stack.

- en: We will introduce you to Angular's `@NgModule` decorator, which we will use
    exclusively to help organize our app's code into logical units with explicit purpose
    and portability in mind. We will also introduce a few Angular concepts we will
    use in our architecture, such as dependency injectable services. After doing our
    diligence in building a solid foundation to work with, we will rapidly approach
    running our app for the first time towards the end of third chapter.

    way for rapid feature development in the future.

    to your app. Your usage of these services does not need to know the specifics
    of where the data came from, just that it can ask the service for its purpose
    and it will happen.

    exercise to think about the user expectations as a first step to guiding your
    thought process into the various sections or modules you need to construct to

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's also advantageous to provide some low-level services that provide a convenient
    API to access things, such as HTTP remote requests and/or logging. Doing so will
    allow you to create unique characteristics that you or your team like to work
    with when interacting with low-level APIs. For instance, maybe your backend API requires
    a unique header to be set in addition to a special authentication header for each
    request. Creating a low-level wrapper around an HTTP service will allow you to
    isolate those unique characteristics and provide a consistent API for your app
    to interact with, to guarantee all the API calls are enhanced with what they need
    in one place.

- en: Additionally, your team may desire an ability to funnel all the logging code
    to a third-party log analyzer (for debugging or other performance-related metrics).
    Creating low-level wrappers with the lean code around some framework services
    will allow your app to adapt to these potential needs quickly.

- en: Angular provides us with the `@NgModule` decorator, which will help us define
    what these modules look like and what they provide to our app. In an effort to
    keep our app's bootstrap/launch time as fast as possible, we can organize our
    modules in such a way to allow some service/features to be lazily loaded after
    our app has launched. Bootstrapping one module with a small subset of required
    code that our app needs to launch will help keep this launch phase to a minimum.

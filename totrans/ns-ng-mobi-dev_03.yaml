    *Feature Modules,* and now it's time to finally get a glimpse of what we're working

- en: Building views with NativeScript for Angular is not much different than view
    building for the web. We will use Angular's Component decorator to build various
    components our UI needs to achieve the desired usability we're after. Instead
    of using the HTML markup, we will be using NativeScript XML, which is an extremely
    powerful, yet simple and concise, abstraction of all native view components on
    both iOS and Android.

    *Get into Shape with @NgModule*, we can see a header at the top of the app, which
    will contain our app title with the record button to the right. We also see a
    listing of tracks with some player controls at the bottom. We can break these
    key elements of our UI design into essentially three primary components. One component
    is already provided by the NativeScript framework, the ActionBar, which we will
    use to represent the top header.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NativeScript provides many rich view components to build our UI. The markup
    is not HTML but rather XML with an `.html` extension, which may seem unusual.
    The reason the `.html` extension is used for XML view templates with NativeScript
    for Angular is that the custom renderer ([https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular))
    uses a DOM adapter to parse the view template. Each NativeScript XML component
    represents true native view widgets on each respective platform.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the other two primary components, we will use Angular's Component decorator.
    It's important at this phase of the app development cycle to think about encapsulated
    pieces of UI functionality. We will encapsulate our track listing as a component
    and the player controls as another component. In this exercise, we will use an outside-in
    approach to building our UI from an abstract viewpoint down to the implementation
    details of each component.

    concept from our sketch:'

    for the main view, `GridLayout`. With NativeScript, it''s important that each
    view starts with a layout container as the root node (outside of any `ActionBar`
    or `ScrollView`), much like `div` tags that are used with HTML markup. At the
    time of this writing, there are six layout containers provided by NativeScript:
    `StackLayout`, `GridLayout`, `FlexboxLayout`, `AbsoluteLayout`, `DockLayout`,
    and `WrapLayout`. For our layout here, `GridLayout` will work well.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All about the GridLayout
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The GridLayout is one of the three most used layouts you will use in your NativeScript
    application (the others are FlexboxLayout and StackLayout). This is the layout
    that allows you to build complex layouts easily.  To use the GridLayout is very
    much like the enhanced table in HTML.  You are basically going to want to take
    your screen area and divide your screen into the pieces you need. It will allow
    you to tell the columns (or rows) to be a percentage of the remaining width (and
    height) of the screen. The grid supports three types of values; **absolute size**,
    a percentage of **remaining space**, and **used space**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For **absolute size**, you just type in the number. For example, `100` means
    it will use 100 dp of space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another name for **dp** is **dip**. They are the same. A device-independent
    pixel (also density-independent pixel, DIP, or DP) is a physical unit of measurement
    based on a coordinate system held by a computer and represents an abstraction
    of a pixel for use by an application that an underlying system then converts to
    physical pixels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you take the smallest iOS device supported, it has a screen width of 320dp.
    For other devices, such as tablets, some have a width of 1024 dp. So, 100 dp would
    be almost one third of an iOS phone, where it is one tenth of the screen on a
    tablet. So, this is something you need to think about when using fixed absolute
    values. It is typically better to use the used space over a fixed value, unless
    you are needing to constrain the column to a specific size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use **remaining space-**based values , that is, `***`, the `***` tells it
    to use the rest of the remaining space. If the columns (or rows) is set to *`*`, `*`*,
    then space will be divided into two equal remainders of space. Likewise, `rows="*,*,*,*,*"`
    will specify five equal sized rows. You can also specify things, such as `columns="2*,3*,*",`
    and you will get three columns; the first column will be two sixth of the screen,
    the second column will be three sixth of the screen, and the final column will
    be one sixth of the screen (that is, 2+3+1 = 6).  This allows you great flexibility
    in how to use the remainder of the space.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third type of sizing is **space used**. So what happens is the content inside
    the grid is measured and then the column is assigned the size that is the max
    used in that column (or row). This is very useful when you have a grid where you
    have data but you aren't sure of the size or you don't really care; you just want
    it to look good. So, this is the auto keyword. I might have `columns="auto,auto,*,auto"`.
    This means columns 1,2, and 4 will all be automatically sized based on the content
    inside those columns; and column 3 will use whatever space is left over. This
    is very useful for laying out the entire screen or parts of the screen where you
    are looking for a certain look.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final reason why the GridLayout is one of the best layouts is that when
    you assign items to the GridLayout, you can actually assign multiple items to
    the same rows and/or columns and you can use row or column spans to allow items
    to use more than one row and/or column.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To assign an object, you just assign it via `row="0"` and/or `col="0"` (keep
    in mind these are index-based positions). You can also use `rowSpan` and `colSpan`
    to make an element span multiple rows and/or columns. Overall, the GridLayout
    is the most versatile layout and allows you to easily create almost any layout
    you will need in your app.

- en: Inside the grid, we have declared a `track-list` component to represent our track
    listing, which will flex vertically, taking up all the vertical space and leaving
    only a height of 100 for `player-controls`. We indicate `track-list` as `row="0"
    col="0"`, since rows and columns are index-based. The flexible (remainder) vertical
    height is defined via the GridLayout's `*` in the rows attribute. The bottom section
    of the grid (row 1) will represent the player controls, allowing users to play/pause
    the mix and shuttle the playback position.

    module from the NativeScript framework ([https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/dialogs](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/dialogs))
    is a very convenient service, allowing you to create native alerts, confirms,
    prompts, actions, and basic login dialogs. However, we may want to provide custom
    native dialog implementations on both iOS and Android down the road for an even
    nicer UX experience. There are several plugins that provide very elegant native

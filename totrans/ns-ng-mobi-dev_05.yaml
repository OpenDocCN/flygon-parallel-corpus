    which explains this perfectly:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Angular adds `@NgModule.providers` to the application root injector unless the
    module is lazy loaded. For a lazy-loaded module, Angular creates a child injector
    and adds the module's providers to the child injector.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that a module behaves differently depending on whether it's loaded
    during application start or lazily loaded later. Neglecting that difference can
    lead to adverse consequences.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why doesn't Angular add lazy-loaded providers to the app root injector as it
    does for eagerly loaded modules?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer is grounded in a fundamental characteristic of the Angular dependency-injection
    system. An injector can add providers until it's first used. Once an injector
    starts creating and delivering services, its provider list is frozen; no new providers
    are allowed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When an application starts, Angular first configures the root injector with
    the providers of all eagerly loaded modules before creating its first component
    and injecting any of the provided services. Once the application begins, the app
    root injector is closed to new providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Time passes and application logic triggers lazy loading of a module. Angular
    must add the lazy-loaded module's providers to an injector somewhere. It can't
    add them to the app root injector because that injector is closed to new providers.
    So Angular creates a new child injector for the lazy-loaded module context.

    APIs. For example, instead of the app using `XMLHttpRequest` (which is a web API),
    it will use native HTTP APIs made available on both iOS and Android for the ultimate

    once. Then, any time those services are injected anywhere (*in a lazily loaded

    background color we assigned via CSS and the button color now displays the default
    blue color. This is because `RecordComponent` does not define `ActionBar`; therefore,
    it is reverting to a default styled `ActionBar` with a default back button, which
    takes on the title of the page it just navigated from. The `'/record'` route is
    also using the ability of `page-router-outlet` to push components onto the mobile
    navigation stack. `RecordComponent` is animated into view while allowing the user
    to choose the top left button to navigate back (to pop the navigation history
    back one).

    not do anything. Android''s default behavior relies on the device''s physical

    feel as exhilarated as we do. This chapter has presented some interesting Angular
    concepts, including route configuration with lazy loaded modules to keep the app
    startup time fast; building a custom module loader using native file handling
    APIs; combining the flexibility of `router-outlet` with NativeScript's `page-router-outlet`;
    gaining control and understanding of Singleton services with lazy loaded modules;
    guarding routes dependent on authorized access; and working on late feature requirements
    to show off our wonderfully scalable app design.

- en: tns run <platform>
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `tns run <platform>` command will automatically build your app and sync
    it up to the devices and emulators. It will do all the heavy-lifting to try and
    make your app be in a running state on the device, and then it will launch the
    app. This command has changed over the years and has now become a fairly smart
    command that will automatically make certain choices to simplify your development
    life. One of the cool features of this command is that it will sync your application
    to all running and connected devices. If you have five different devices hooked
    up, all five of them will receive the changes. This only works per each platform,
    but you can run `tns run ios` in one and `tns run android` in another command
    window, and then any changes will automatically be synced to all devices connected
    to your machine. As you may imagine, this is very useful during the testing and
    cleaning up phase to make sure that everything continues to look good on different
    phones and tablets. If you have no physical devices hooked up to your computer,
    it will automatically launch an emulator for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Normally, since the app already exists on the devices, it will just do a quick
    live sync of the changed files. This is a very fast process, as it just transfers
    all the changes in your files from your own `app` folder to all the connected
    devices, and then starts the app.  This process is, in the majority of situations,
    a really good thing. However, `tns run <platform>` will not always automatically
    detect any changes to your `node_modules` folder, for example, when you upgrade
    a plugin. If this is the case, you will need to cancel the current running `tns
    run` and then start a new `tns run`. Occasionally, the `tns run` will still believe
    that all it needs to do is sync, whereas the reality is that it should have to
    rebuild the app.  In this case, you will want to use the handy-dandy `--clean`
    option.  This is very important for times when the device does not seems to pick
    up any of your changes. The `tns run <platform> --clean` command will normally
    force the app to be rebuilt; however, if `--clean` fails to rebuild, then check
    out the `tns build` command described later in the chapter. There are a couple
    of other command parameters that aren't used much, but you might need them for
    a specific situation. The `--justlaunch` will start the app and do nothing else;
     `--no-watch` will disable live syncing, and finally `--device <device id>` will
    force the app to be installed only on a specific device. You can view which devices
    are available for the installation of the app by running `tns devices`.

    you to use the debug tools to test your application. This works in a similar way
    to the `tns run` command; however, instead of it just running your app, it will
    debug it. The debugger will use the standard Chrome development tools, which enables
    you to step through the code: break points, call stacks, and console logs. This
    command will give you a URL, which you can use to open in Chrome. In iOS specifically,
    you should run `tns debug ios --chrome` to get the URL for chrome-devtools. The
    following is an example of debugging Android via the Chrome debugger:'

    `--device`, and `--clean`. In addition to those commands, several other commands
    are available, for example, `--debug-brk`, which is used to make the app break
    at the start of the application so that you can easily set breakpoints before
    continuing the start up process. `--start` and `--stop` allow you to attach and
    detach from an already running application.
  prefs: []

- en: Don't forget that if you are currently using the debugger, JavaScript has the
    cool `debugger;` command, which will force an attached debugger to break just
    as though you had a breakpoint set.  This can be used to put a break anywhere
    in your code, and it is ignored if a debugger is not attached to your program.

- en: The next command you will need to be aware of is `tns build <platform>`; this
    command fully builds a new app from scratch.  Now, the primary use for this command
    is when you want to build a debug or release version of the app you are going
    to give to somebody else to test or to upload it to one of the stores. However,
    it can also be used to force a fully clean build of the application, if the `tns
    run` version of your app is in a weird state--this will do a full rebuild. If
    you don't include the `--release` flag, the build will be the default debug build.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On iOS, you will use `--for-device`, which will make the app compile for a real
    device rather than an emulator. Remember that you need to have signing keys from
    Apple to do a proper release build.

    here and discuss how to actually create a keystore. This is normally only a one-time
    thing, that you will need to do for each Android application you want to release.
    This is also not something you need to worry about for iOS applications, as Apple
    provides you the signing keys, and they fully control them.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On Android, you create your own application signing keys. As such, this key
    is used for the entire life of your application--by entire, I mean you use the
    same key to release every version of your application. This key is what links
    version 1.0 to v1.1 to v2.0\. Without using the same key, the application will
    be considered a totally different application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason there are two passwords is that your keystore can actually contain
    an unlimited number of keys, and so, each key in the keystore has its own password.
    Anyone who has access to this key can pretend to be you. This is helpful for building
    servers, but not so helpful if you lose them. You cannot change the key at a later
    time, so making backups of your keystore is extremely important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without your keystore, you will never be able to release a new version of the
    exact same application name, meaning that anyone using the older version will
    not see that you have an updated version. So, again, it is critical that you back
    up your keystore file.

- en: Note that in addition to ensuring that you keep a good back up of your keystores,
    if you ever sell your application to another vendor, having separate keystores
    per application makes the transfer a lot easier and safer for you. If you use
    the same keystore and/or alias, it makes it difficult for you to separate out
    who gets what. So, for the sake of simplicity, I personally recommend that you
    have a separate keystore and alias per application. I normally keep the keystore
    in with the app and under version control. Since both opening and accessing an
    alias are password protected, you are fine unless you choose your passwords poorly.

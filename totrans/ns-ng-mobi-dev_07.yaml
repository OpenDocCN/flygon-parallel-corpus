    many opportunities to you as a mobile developer. In particular, our app is going
    to need to take advantage of rich native audio APIs on both iOS and Android to
    achieve its core competency of delivering a compelling multitrack recording/mixing
    experience to our users.

    your mobile app's full potential. Additionally, learning how to integrate existing
    NativeScript plugins, which may already provide consistent APIs on both iOS and
    Android, can help you reach your goals even faster. Leveraging the best performance
    each platform can deliver will be the focus of our journey in Part 3.

    Angular bindings where useful, like these bindings: `[maxValue]="duration"` and `[text]="durationDisplay"` .
    However for the rest of our usability wiring we will want more fine grained and
    manual control. For instance, our containing `GridLayout` via `#sliderArea` is
    going to be the area the user is going to be able to touch to shuttle back/forth
    instead of the `Slider` component itself, and we are going to completely disable
    user interaction with the Slider itself (hence, the `slim-slider` directive attribute,
    you see). The slider is going to instead be used just for its visual representation
    of time.

    `platform` module. This will allow us to do some calculations using our user's
    finger position on our `sliderArea` StackLayout to adjust the actual value of
    `Slider`. We then make a call to set up our essential event handlers.

    a small adjustment when the user passes the 50% mark. This usability works well

    however, it's perfectly fine for now.

    to move immediately with the user's finger, as well as the time display label
    formatted with standard musical timecode to represent real time as they interact,
    we set their values directly at the appropriate time.

    to our multitrack player. Each movement by the user will further delay making
    an actual seek command until they rest where they want it. We also use our `isIOS`
    Boolean to convert the time as appropriately needed by each platform audio player
    (seconds for iOS and milliseconds for Android).

    property changes, `currentTime`, and `duration`. Here, we simply update our slider
    and the current time display label manually via `this._updateSlider(this.currentTime)`
    only when it does fire with a valid number. Lastly, we also ensure we update our
    duration display label. This method will fire every second the PlayerService's
    `currentTime$` observable fires while an active subscription exists. **Nice!**
    Oh, and don't forget to add `ShuttleSliderComponent` to the `COMPONENTS` array
    to be included with the module.

    we switch our Observable stream to `Observable.never()` while `this._seeking`
    is true, ensuring our observer is never called.'

    ,and if it was currently `this._playing` and had not yet been paused due to seeking
    (hence, `!this._seekPaused`), we immediately pause playback (only once). We then
    set up another timeout to delay resuming playback an additional 400 milliseconds
    after `seekTo` has been fired from the component if it was playing when seek started
    (hence, the check on `this._seekPaused`).

    much as they'd like and as quickly as they'd like. They will see immediate UI
    updates to the `Slider` track as well as the current time display label in real
    time; all the while we are avoiding extraneous `seekTo` commands being sent to
    our multitrack player until they come to rest, providing a really nice user experience.

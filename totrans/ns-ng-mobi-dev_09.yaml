    beyond measure for mobile development. Whether you need to provide services to

    *Building an audio recorder*, we designed a dual-purpose custom NativeScript Waveform
    view, which taps into various native libraries for iOS and Android, specifically
    to enrich our composition's track listing view. Let's proceed by reusing our versatile
    Waveform view for our track listing view. This will also give us a way to display
    mixing slider controls (often referred to in audio production and sound engineering
    as a Fader) alongside our tracks to allow the user to mix each track's volume
    level in the overall composition. Let's set up our `ListView` of `TrackListComponent` with
    the ability to provide the user with two different ways to view and work with
    their tracks, each with their own unique utility. While we're at it, we'll also
    take this opportunity to finally wire up the `mute` switch on our tracks.

    provides the ability to change our `ListView` item rows on the fly. The result
    of the `templateSelector` function should be a string, which matches the value
    provided on any ng-template''s `ngTemplateKey` attribute. To make all this work,
    we will need several things in place, starting with the `Component` that has access
    to the `ListView` via `#listview` and `ViewChild`:'

    use later to call `this._listview.refresh()` . This is required in Angular when
    we need the `ListView` to update the display after changes. The first surprise
    will likely be the injection of `PlayerService`, and the second might be the `this.templateSelector
    = this._templateSelector.bind(this)`. The `templateSelector` binding is not scope
    bound, and since we need it to return a property reference from our `this.playerService`
    on the `Component`, we ensure that it is properly bound to the scope of the `Component` by
    binding a `Function` reference. We will use `PlayerService` as a conduit at this
    point to help communicate the state from the `ActionBarComponent` that lives in
    the `MixerModule`.

    app. However, this practice can be greatly improved by utilizing `ngrx` to help
    lessen interwoven dependencies and unlock a purely reactive setup with Redux-style

    adjust each track's volume (mixing control) and float a label off to the top-left

    an `AbsoluteLayout` container, which allows us to overlap components and manually

- en: Normally you can reuse and extend controls in NativeScript quite easily. However,
    this is one of those exception cases where the default NativeScript setter on
    the slider control is actually going to cause us problems **only on Android**.
    The default setter will attempt to set the color of the thumb to blue along with
    a method to blend it. When it sets this flag on the slider, any graphic shape
    we then set gets the shape set to all blue. So for our version of the slider class
    to handle a custom graphic we have to eliminate the default slider thumb color
    setter on the control. We take control of this by attaching a new "color" setter
    that does absolutely nothing. This way when the NativeScript framework tries to
    setup the default color while initializing or resetting the control, nothing will
    happen allowing us to completely control what happens. As a precaution at the
    end of the `_addThumbImg` method we also call `seekBar.getThumb().clearColorFilter();` for
    good measure to make sure any potential sets to the colorFilter are undone before
    we were able to silence the default color setter.

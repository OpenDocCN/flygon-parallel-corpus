- en: After covering some under the hood plumbing improvements with ngrx state management
    in the previous chapter,  it's finally time to polish this app to improve it's
    overall look and feel. The timing of styling is completely up to your flow of
    development, and oftentimes, we like to polish as we go. In this book, we chose
    to avoid intermixing polishing via CSS with feature development to keep the concepts
    more focused. However, now that we're here, we couldn't be more excited about
    getting that nice look on our app.

    integrate SASS for help. In fact, we will utilize a community plugin developed

    language in the world... Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance
    to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline
    imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. SASS helps keep large
    stylesheets well-organized and get small stylesheets up and running.

    SASS source files, which are already organized to help you build your custom SASS
    on top of it easily.

    the app's look and feel. We were able to install the `nativescript-dev-sass` plugin,
    which adds a compilation step to build our CSS while maintaining a clean approach
    to styling. Knowing how best to take advantage of the core theme's SASS with proper
    file organization is key to gaining a flexible base to work with. Take the concepts
    presented in this chapter and let us know how they helped you achieve the styling
    goals you are after; we would love to hear about it!

    doesn't allow you to test whether the button used in your app still actually runs
    a function, or what happens when the user swipes left. For that, we will need
    application testing or end-to-end testing. Well, let's start learning end-to-end
    testing; this is where testing can get complicated and fun.

    how to use Appium ([http://appium.io](http://appium.io)). Appium is an awesome
    open source application testing framework. Appium supports both iOS and Android,
    which makes it a perfect fit for doing all our on-device testing. You want to
    start creating tests to test your basic flow through your application, and even
    create more complicated tests that test alternate flows through your app.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The preceding command installs Appium, the Appium communication driver **WD** ([http://admc.io/wd/](http://admc.io/wd/)),
    and the **NativeScript driver** ([https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-appium](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-appium)).
    The WD driver is what communicates with Appium and the NativeScript driver. The
    `nativescript-dev-appium` is the driver that interacts with WD and your test code.
    In reality, the NativeScript driver is a very thin wrapper around the WD driver
    and just facilitates some configuration and then exposes the WD driver to your
    application. So interaction commands will be found in the WD documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Application/Integration testing takes a bit more work, as you have to programmatically
    run it as a normal user would interact with your app. So, you have to do things,
    such as find the button element, then perform `button.tap()`. So, your tests might
    be a bit verbose, but this allows you to test any, and all, functionalities. The
    down side is that this is a lot more time-consuming to run and takes more maintenance
    work when you change screens. However, the payoff is that when you add code, it
    verifies that your app still runs properly on each screen automatically, and you
    can test it on multiple devices and resolutions, once again automatically.

- en: After installation, you will have a brand new `e2e-tests` folder in your root
    folder of your application. This folder is where all your end-to-end test files
    will live. Now, one thing that you need to know is that the Appium NativeScript
    driver uses the MochaJS test framework ([https://mochajs.org/](https://mochajs.org/)).
    The Mocha testing framework is similar to the Jasmine framework, which we discussed
    in the preceding chapter. It uses the same `describe` and `it` functions for the
    start of the tests, just like Jasmine. In addition, it uses the Chai ([http://chaijs.com/](http://chaijs.com/))
    and ShouldJS ([https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js))
    testing frameworks that work hand in hand with the Mocha test framework and the
    WD driver.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to note is that all these are designed around pure JavaScript.
    You can get typings for Mocha, Should, and Chai, but for the NativeScript Appium
    driver or WD driver, typings don't exist. You can use TypeScript, but it is awkward,
    as commands are not just WD-based commands but chained through mocha. TypeScript
    gets easily confused as to what context you are in. So, mostly the Appium tests
    are created in pure JavaScript rather than in TypeScript. However, feel free to
    use TypeScript if you want; just make sure that you run `tsc` to build the `JS`
    files before you run the tests.

    The first one is an Android 4.4 device, and the second one is an iOS simulator
    (iPhone 6 runs iOS 10). You can have as many configurations as you want in this
    file. When you run Appium, you can tell it which device you will target, using
    the `--runType=KEY` parameter.

    work well to properly find elements with NativeScript . However there is also
    a `.waitForElementByXPath` and `.waitForElementById` which both wait for the elements
    to show up. If you look at the documentation, you will observe a lot of `elementByXXX`
    commands, but Appium was designed for a browser, and NativeScript is not a browser.
    That is why, only some commands that have been emulated in the nativescript-dev-appium
    driver work to find elements in the NativeScript DOM.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'So our test says find an element by XPath. XPath allows you to drill into your
    DOM and find components any level deep and also subcomponents of other components.
    So, if you do something like `/GridLayout/StackLayout/Label`, it will find a `Label`
    that is a child of a `StackLayout`, which is a child of a `GridLayout`. Using
    `*//*` will mean that you can find that element at any level in the DOM. Finally
    the `nsAppium.getXPathElement` is a method which was added to the official NativeScript
    driver by Nathanael Anderson to allow us to make the XPath tests cross-platform.
    In all reality, what you are passing to the XPath function is the real native
    name of the object. For example, a button on Android is a `android.widget.Button` or
    it could be a `UIAButton` or a `XCUIElementTypeButton` on iOS. So because you
    don''t want to hardcode `getByElementXPath("android.widget.Button")`, this helper
    function translates the NativeScript `Button` to the proper underlying OS element
    that NativeScript actually uses when it creates a button in NativeScript. If,
    in the future, you add a plugin that uses an element that the `getXPathElement`
    doesn''t know about, you can still use the real name of the element for those

    the Unicode value of F067, which in Font-Awesome is the Plus character (fa-plus).
    Once it exists, we are happy--the test either succeeds or fails, depending on
    whether we break the screen or the screen continues to be the way we expect it.

    is because this example shows how to use the asynchronous support of `it`. For
    an async support, you can use a promise or make the function coming into `it`
    have a `done` callback function. When Mocha detects a callback function in the
    `it`, it will run your `it` tests in the async mode and doesn't need the promise
    to let it know that it can resume with the next test. Sometimes, you may just
    want to maintain full control or you may be calling code that requires async callbacks.

- en: This test looks for a `EditText` element that contains `Enter your name`. Then,
    it actually types *Testing* into it using the `sendKeys`. Next, it asks for the
    `text` out of the field and uses the `then` part of the promise to check the value
    against the hardcoded testing. When it is all finished, it calls the `done` function.
    If you pass the `done` function an `Error` object, then it knows that the test
    failed. So, you can see in the `if` statement that we passed a `new Error` and
    that we put the `done` function in the `catch` part of the `then` statement.

    if you were manually doing each step. Initially, in your development, manually
    testing is a lot faster. However, as you start to build up end-to-end tests, each
    time you make changes, you can check whether the app still works properly, and
    you do not have to sit in front of multiple devices for any amount of time--you
    just start the tests and see the results later.

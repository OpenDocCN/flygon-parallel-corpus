    an excellent article detailing deployment steps titled *8 Steps to Publish Your
    NativeScript App to the App Stores* ([https://www.nativescript.org/blog/steps-to-publish-your-nativescript-app-to-the-app-stores](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/steps-to-publish-your-nativescript-app-to-the-app-stores)).
    We will take excerpts from that article and expand on sections wherever possible
    here in this chapter and the next chapter.

    one of the most painful processes you'll go through in your software development
    career. So, in case you get stuck or confused in these steps, just know that it's
    not just you—everyone gets frustrated when releasing iOS apps the first time.

    screen. By default, NativeScript sets your app's display name based on the value
    you passed to `tns create`, which is oftentimes not exactly what you want the
    user to see. For example, running `tns create my-app` results in an app with a
    display name of `myapp`.

    file. The `Info.plist` file is iOS's main configuration file, and here you'll
    find a number of values you may want to tinker with before releasing your app.
    For display name, you'll want to alter the `CFBundleDisplayName` value.

    icon with the image you'll want to go to the stores with.

- en: To make your life difficult, both iOS and Android require you to provide a variety
    of icon images in a wide array of sizes. Don't worry though; once you have a 1024
    x 1024 image, there are a few sites that will generate images in the various dimensions
    that Android and iOS require. For the NativeScript development, I recommend that
    you use the Nathanael Anderson's NativeScript Image Builder, which is available
    at `images.nativescript.rocks`.

    we'll have to deal with, such as screenshots.

- en: iTunes Connect now requires you to upload two sets of screenshots, one for the
    largest iPhone devices (5.5-inch displays), and another for the largest iPad devices
    (12.9-inch devices). Apple still gives you the ability to provide optimized screenshots
    for each and every iOS device dimension, but if you provide only 5.5-inch and
    12.9-inch screenshots, Apple will rescale your provided screenshots for smaller
    display devices automatically.

    nontrivial delay between the time you upload your iOS app and the time that your
    app shows up in iTunes Connect. We saw that the delay can be as short as 30 seconds
    and as long as an hour. Once the build shows up there, we can go ahead and click

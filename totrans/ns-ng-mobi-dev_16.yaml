- en: Although deploying an app to Google Play can be slightly simpler when compared
    to the Apple App Store, there's still a few key steps that we need to pay attention
    to. We covered some preparation steps in [Chapter 14](part0154.html#4IRMK0-289fe2426d594f99a90e4363b2c9c34d),
    *Deployment Preparation with webpack Bundling*, and [Chapter 15](part0163.html#4REBM0-289fe2426d594f99a90e4363b2c9c34d),
    *Deploying to the Apple App Store*, such as using webpack to bundle the app and
    preparing app icons and splash screens, so we will jump right into building a
    releasable APK.

    On Android, this file has a `.apk` extension, and you can generate this file using
    the NativeScript CLI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The `tns run` command you were using during NativeScript development actually
    generates a `.apk` file for you and installs that file on an Android emulator
    or device. However, for a Google Play release, the build you create must also
    be code signed. You can refer to Android''s documentation ([https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html))
    on code signing if you want to dive into the cryptographic details, but at a high
    level, you will need to do the following two things to create a release version
    of your Android app:'

- en: The Android documentation provides you a few options on how you can create your
    keystore file ([https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#release-mode](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#release-mode)).
    Our preferred approach is the `keytool` command-line utility, which is included
    in the Java JDK that NativeScript installs for you, so it should already be available
    on your development machine's command line.
  prefs: []

    the following command:'

- en: 'The `keytool` utility will ask you a number of questions, several of which
    are optional (name of organization and the names of your city, state, and country),
    but the most important ones are the passwords for both the keystore and the alias
    (more on that later on). Here''s what the `keytool` process looks like when we
    generate the keystore:'

  prefs: []

- en: Before we move on to how to use this `.jks` file, there's one important thing
    you need to know. Place this `.jks` file somewhere safe, and do not forget the
    password for the keystore or for the alias. (Personally, I like using the same
    password for my keystore and my aliases to simplify my life.) Android requires
    you to use this exact same `.jks` file to sign in to any and all updates to your
    app. This means that if you lose this `.jks` file, or its password, you will not
    be able to update your Android app. You'll have to create a brand new entry in
    Google Play, and your existing users will not be able to upgrade—so take care
    not to lose it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oh, and one more thing to note in most cases is that you'll want to use a single
    keystore file to sign in to all of your personal or company's Android applications.
    Remember how you had to pass a -alias flag to the keytool utility, and how that
    alias had its own password? It turns out that one keystore can have many aliases,
    and you'll want to create one for each Android app that you build.

    and secure location, the rest of the process is quite easy.

    and Google Play. This has been quite an adventure with many twists and turns.
    We sincerely hope that this has given you deep insight into NativeScript for Angular
    app development as well as demystified any areas of this exciting tech stack for
    those who have been curious.

    you to get involved, speak about your experiences, and share your excitement with
    others with all the exhilarating projects you and your teams may be working on.
    Never hesitate to reach out and ask for help, as we all take responsibility in
    our love and admiration for these two technologies.

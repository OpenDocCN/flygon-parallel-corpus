- en: JavaScript has emerged as one of the most robust and versatile programming language
    around. Modern JavaScript embraces a vast array of time-tested and cutting edge
    features. Several of these features are slowly giving shape to the next generation
    of web and server platforms. ES6 introduces very important language constructs,
    such as promises, classes, arrow functions, and several, much anticipated features.
    This book takes a detailed look at the language constructs and their practical
    uses. This book doesn't assume any prior knowledge of JavaScript and works from
    the ground up to give you a thorough understanding of the language. People who
    know the language will still find it useful and informative. For people who already
    know JavaScript and are familiar with ES5 syntax, this book will be a very useful
    primer for ES6 features.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Object-Oriented JavaScript"), *Object-Oriented
    JavaScript*, talks briefly about the history, present, and future of JavaScript,
    and then moves on to explore the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) in
    general. You will then learn how to set up your training environment (Firebug)
    in order to dive into the language on your own, using the book examples as a base.'

    Conditions"), *Primitive Data Types, Arrays, Loops, and Conditions*, discusses
    the language basics-variables, data types, primitive data types, arrays, loops,
    and conditionals.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Functions"), *Functions*, covers functions
    that JavaScript uses, and here you will learn to master them all. You will also
    learn about the scope of variables and JavaScript''s built-in functions. An interesting,
    but often misunderstood, feature of the language-closures-is demystified at the
    end of the chapter.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Objects"), *Objects*, talks about objects,
    how to work with properties and methods, and the various ways to create your objects.
    This chapter also talks about built-in objects such as Array, Function, Boolean,
    Number, and String.'

    and Generators*, introduces the most anticipated features of ES6, Iterators and
    Generators. With this knowledge, you will proceed to take a detailed look at the
    enhanced collections constructs.'

    the all-important concept of prototypes in JavaScript. It also explains how the
    prototype chain works, hasOwnProperty(), and some gotchas of prototypes.'

    inheritance works. This chapter also talks about a method to create subclasses
    like other classic languages.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Classes and Modules"), *Classes and Modules*,
    shows that ES6 introduces important syntactical features that makes it easier
    to write classical object-oriented programming constructs. ES6 class syntax wraps
    the slightly complex syntax of ES5\. ES6 also has full language support for modules.
    This chapter goes into the details of the classes and module constructs introduced
    in ES6.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Promises and Proxies"), *Promises and Proxies*,
    explains that JavaScript has always been a language with strong support for asynchronous
    programming. Up until ES5, writing asynchronous programs meant you needed to rely
    on callbacks-sometimes resulting in callback hell.  ES6 promises are a much-awaited
    feature introduced in the language. Promises provide a much cleaner way to write
    asynchronous programs in ES6\. Proxies are used to define custom behavior to some
    of the fundamental operations. This chapter looks at practical uses of both promises
    and proxies in ES6.'

    the Book of Four, the most influential work of software design patterns. This
    chapter also discusses JSON.'

    talks about how Modern JavaScript is equipped with tools that support Test Driven
    Development and Behavior Driven Development. Jasmine is one of the most popular
    tools available at the moment. This chapter discusses TDD and BDD using Jasmine
    as the framework.'

    Programming and React*, explains that with the advent of ES6, several radical
    ideas are taking shape. Reactive programming takes a very different approach to
    how we manage change of states using data flows. React, however, is a framework
    focusing on the View part of MVC. This chapter discusses these two ideas.'

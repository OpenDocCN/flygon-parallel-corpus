    a function scope. This means that if a variable is defined inside a function,
    it's not visible outside of the function. However, if it's defined inside an `if`
    or a `for` code block, it's visible outside the block. The term global variables
    describes variables you define outside of any function (in the global program
    code), as opposed to local variables, which are defined inside a function. The

    Imagine two people working on two different functions in the same script, and
    they both decide to use the same name for their global variable. This could easily
    lead to unexpected results and hard-to-find bugs. Always declare your variables
    with the `var` statement. Consider a single `var` pattern. Define all variables
    needed in your function at the very top of the function so you have a single place
    to look for variables and, hopefully, prevent accidental globals.

    because, inside the function, the local scope is more important than the global
    scope. So, a local variable overwrites any global variable with the same name.
    At the time of the first `alert()`, the `a` variable was not yet defined (hence
    the `undefined` value), but it still existed in the local space due to the special

    block. If you are coming from a background in Java or C/C++, the concept of a
    block scope will be very familiar to you. In those languages, programmers introduced
    blocks just to define a scope. In JavaScript, however, there was a need to idiomatically
    introduce blocks as they didn''t have a scope associated to it. However, ES6 allows
    you to create block-scoped variables using the `let` keyword. As you can see in
    the preceding example, variable `a` created inside the block is available within
    the block. While declaring block-scoped variables, it is generally recommended
    to add the `let` declaration at the top of the block. Let''s look at another example
    to clearly distinguish function and block scope:'

    trying to do that makes it necessary for you to use `var` declarations, make sure
    you prefer block scoped variables. However, incorrectly using the `let` keyword
    can cause a couple of problems. First, you cannot redeclare the same variable

    keyword creates a read-only reference to a value. This does not mean that the
    value held by the reference is immutable. However, the variable identifier cannot

    `let` keyword. Also, you have to assign a value to the variable while declaring
    them.

- en: Every function can be considered a closure. This is because every function maintains
    a secret link to the environment (the scope) in which it was created. But, most
    of the time, this scope is destroyed unless something interesting happens (as
    shown in the preceding code) that causes it to be maintained.

- en: Based on what you've seen so far, you can say that a closure is created when
    a function keeps a link to its parent scope even after the parent has returned.
    And, every function is a closure because, at the very least, every function maintains
    access to the global scope, which is never destroyed.

    Function parameters behave like local variables to this function, but they are

    to expose this variable because you don't want just any part of the code to be
    able to alter its value. You can protect this variable inside a function and provide
    two additional functions-one to get the value and one to set it. The one that
    sets it could contain some logic to validate a value before assigning it to the
    protected variable. Let's make the validation part simple (for the sake of keeping

    function expression and pass it to the click function. This style of writing anonymous
    function expressions is known as **Lambda functions**. Several other languages
    support this feature. Though lambdas are more or less standard in new languages,
    JavaScript was responsible for popularizing their usage. However, the lambda syntax
    in JavaScript has not been very concise. ES6 arrow functions fill that gap and

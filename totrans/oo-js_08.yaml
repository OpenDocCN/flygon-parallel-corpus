- en: In this chapter, we will explore some of the most interesting features introduced
    in ES6\. JavaScript is a prototype-based language and supports prototypical inheritance.
    In the previous chapter, we discussed the prototype property of an object and
    how prototypical inheritance works in JavaScript. ES6 brings in classes. If you
    are coming from traditional object-oriented languages such as Java, you will immediately
    relate to the well-known concepts of classes. However, they are not the same in
    JavaScript. Classes in JavaScript are a syntactic sugar over the prototypical
    inheritance we discussed in the last chapter.

    are welcome changes to this edition of JavaScript and make **Object Oriented Programming**
    (**OOP**) and inheritance significantly easier.

    inheritance may feel a bit out of place for you. ES6 classes offer a more traditional
    syntax for you to get familiarized with prototypical inheritance in JavaScript.

    use the ES6 classes syntax over the prototypical inheritance syntax of ES5.

    right at home. However, one important thing to remember is that classes do not
    introduce any new object-oriented inheritance model to the language, but bring
    in a much nicer way to create objects and handle inheritance.

    using function expressions and declarations, you can define classes as well. One
    way to define classes is using class declaration.

    normal functions are hoisted, classes are not. A normal function is available
    immediately when you enter a scope in which it is declared; this is called **hoisting**,

    it will be available. However, classes are not hoisted; they are available only
    after they are declared. For a normal function, you can say:'

    is a special method used to create and initialize an object created with the class.
    You can have only one constructor in a class. Constructors are a bit different
    from the normal constructor functions. Unlike normal constructors, a class constructor
    can call its parent class constructor via `super()`. We will discuss this in detail

    support modules for some time now. ES6, however, offers built-in modules. Traditionally,
    JavaScript's major use was on browsers, where most of the JavaScript code was
    either embedded or small enough to manage without much trouble. Things have changed.
    JavaScript projects are now on a massive scale. Without an efficient system of
    spreading the code into files and directories, managing code becomes a nightmare.

    no module keyword. Whatever code you write in the module file is local to the
    module unless you export it. You may have a bunch of functions in a module, and
    you want to export only a few of them. You can export module functionality in
    a couple of ways.

    support to the common JavaScript pattern of simulating class-like inheritance
    hierarchies using functions and prototypes. They are syntactic sugaring over prototype-based
    OO, offering a convenient declarative form for class patterns which encourage
    interoperability. ES6 classes offer a much nicer, cleaner, and clearer syntax
    for creating these objects and dealing with inheritance. ES6 classes provide support
    for constructors, instance and static methods, (prototype-based) inheritance,
    and super calls.

- en: The DOM is a standard governed by the **World Wide Web Consortium** (**W3C**)
    and has different versions, called levels, such as DOM Level 1, DOM Level 2, and
    so on. Browsers in use today have different degrees of compliance with the standard,
    but in general, they almost all completely implement DOM Level 1\. The DOM was
    standardized post factum after the browser vendors had each implemented their
    own ways to access the document. The legacy part from before the W3C took over
    is still around and is referred to as DOM 0, although, no real DOM Level 0 standard
    exists. Some parts of DOM 0 have become de facto standards as all major browsers
    support them; some of these were added to the DOM Level 1 standard. The rest of
    DOM 0 that didn't find its way to DOM 1 is too browser specific and won't be discussed
    here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, BOM was not a part of any standard. Similar to DOM 0, it has a
    subset of objects that is supported by all major browsers, and another subset
    that is browser-specific. The HTML5 standard codifies common behavior among browsers,
    and it includes common BOM objects. Additionally, mobile devices come with their
    specific objects (and HTML5 aims to standardize those as well), which traditionally
    were not necessary for desktop computers, but make sense in a mobile world, for
    example, geolocation, camera access, vibration, touch events, telephony, and SMS.

    guarantee that it will execute exactly at that time. One reason is that most browsers
    don't have millisecond resolution time. If you schedule something in 3 milliseconds,
    it will execute after a minimum of 15 in older IEs and sooner in more modern browsers,
    but most likely, not in 1 millisecond. The other reason is that the browsers maintain
    a queue of what you request them to do. 100 milliseconds timeout means add to
    the queue after 100 milliseconds. However, if the queue is delayed by something
    slow happening, your function will have to wait and execute after, say, 120 milliseconds.

    methods and properties, you can access any element on the page, modify or remove
    elements, or add new ones. The DOM is a language-independent API and can be implemented
    not only in JavaScript, but also in any other language. For example, you can generate
    pages on the server-side with PHP's DOM implementation ([http://php.net/dom](http://php.net/dom)).

    It's not straightforward to do this in a cross-browser manner, but it's possible.
    Events bubble up, so you can use event delegation to listen to events more globally.
    You can also stop the propagation of events and interfere with the default browser
    behavior.

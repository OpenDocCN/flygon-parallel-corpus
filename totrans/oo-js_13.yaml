- en: Along with ES6, several new ideas are emerging. These are powerful ideas and
    can help you build powerful systems with more streamlined code and design. In
    this chapter, we will introduce you to two such ideas-reactive programming and
    react. Although they sound similar, they are very different. This chapter does
    not go into practical details of these ideas but gives you necessary information
    to become aware of what these ideas are capable of. With that information, you
    can start incorporating these ideas and frameworks into your projects. We will
    discuss the basic idea of reactive programming and take a bit more detailed look
    at react.

    new and, like many new ideas, has lots of confusing, and sometimes contradictory
    information floating around. We discussed asynchronous programming earlier in
    this book. JavaScript takes asynchronous programming to new heights by providing
    first class language constructs that support it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Reactive programming is essentially programming with asynchronous event streams.
    An event stream is a sequence of events happening over time. Consider the following
    diagram:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: In the preceding diagram, time passes from left to right and different events
    occur over time. As the event happens over time, we can add an event listener
    to this whole sequence. Whenever an event happens, we can react to it by doing
    something.

    following lines of code:'

    events are happening over time. Instead of having a fixed bunch of elements in
    an array, here they are happening over time, after 500 ms.
  prefs: []

    happens, we will print the element on console. You can see a similarity between
    the methods in arrays and the event streams. Now, to expand on this similarity,
    let''s say, you want to filter all non-numbers from this list. You can use the
    `map` function to this event stream, just like you would use it on an array, and
    then you would want to filter the results to show only integers. Consider the
    following lines of code:'

- en: These are simpler examples just to make sure you start seeing how event streams
    flow over time. Please don't bother about the syntax and construct just yet. Before
    we can look at them, we will need to make sure we understand how to think in reactive
    programming. Event streams are fundamental to reactive programming; they allow
    you to define the dynamic behavior of a value at declaration time (definition
    taken from Andre Staltz's blog).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s say you have an `a` variable, which has initially the value `3`. Then,
    you have a `b` variable, which is `10 * a`. If we console log out `b`, we will
    see `30`. Consider the following lines of code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We know the result is very straightforward. When we change the value of `a`
    to `4`, the value of `b` will not change. This is how static declaration works.
    When we talk about reactive programming and event streams, this is the area where
    people find difficulty in understanding how events flow. Ideally, we want to create
    a formula, *b=a*10*, and over time, whenever the value of `a` changes, the changed
    value is reflected in the formula.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is what we can accomplish with event streams. Let's say `a` is an event
    stream of just the value `3`. Then, we have `streamB`, which is `streamA` mapped.
    Each of these `a` values will be mapped to `10 * a`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If we add an event listener to that `streamB`, and we console log, we will
    see `b` being `30`. Take a look at the following example:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: If we do this, we have an event stream that simply has just two events. It has
    event `3`, and then it has event `4`, and `b` will change accordingly whenever
    `a` changes. If we run this, we see `b` being `30` and `40`.

    sorted, you may ask the following question.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why should you consider reactive programming?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we write highly responsive and interactive UI applications on modern web
    and mobile, there is a strong need to find a way to deal with real-time events
    without stopping the user interactions on the UI. When you are dealing with multiple
    UI and server events being fired, you will be spending most of your time writing
    code to deal with these events. This is tedious. Reactive programming gives you
    a structured framework to deal with asynchronous events with minimal code while
    you focus on the business logic for your application.

    in many platforms and languages, such as Java, Scala, Clojure, Ruby, Python, and
    Object C/Cocoa. `Rx.js` and `Bacon.js` are popular JavaScript libraries that provide
    reactive programming support.

    to introduce you to the idea of reactive programming. If you are keen on adopting
    reactive programming for your projects, you should take look at Andre Staltz's

    to solve an age-old problem-how to deal efficiently with the view part of the
    traditional **Model-View-Controller** applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React provides a declarative and flexible way to build user interfaces. The
    most important thing to remember about react is that it deals with only one thing-the
    view, or the UI. React does not deal with data, data bindings, or anything else.
    There are complete frameworks, such as Angular, that deal with data, bindings,
    and UI; React is not that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React gives a template language and a small set of functions to render HTML.
    React components can store their own state in memory. To build a full-fledged
    application, you will need other pieces as well; React is just to handle the view
    part of that application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big challenge when writing complex UI is to manage state of the UI elements
    when the model changes. React provides a declarative API so that you don't have
    to worry about exactly what changes on every update. This makes writing applications
    a lot easier. React uses **Virtual DOM** and **diffing** algorithm, so that component
    updates are predictable while being fast enough for high-performance apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virtual DOM
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's take a moment to understand what is a Virtual DOM. We discussed **DOM**
    (**document object model**), a tree structure of HTML element on a web page. DOM
    is de facto, and the primary rendering mechanism of the web. The DOM APIs, such
    as `getElementById()`, allow traversing and modification of the elements in the
    DOM tree. DOM is a tree and this structure works pretty well with traversal and
    updating of elements. However, both the traversing and updating of DOM is not
    very quick. For a large page, the DOM tree can be pretty big. When you want a
    complex UI that has bunch of user interactions, updating DOM elements can be tedious
    and slow. We have tried jQuery and other libraries to reduce the tedious syntax
    for frequent DOM modifications, but DOM as a structure itself is quite limited.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if we don't have to traverse the DOM over and over again to modify elements?
    What if you just declare how a component should look like and let someone handle
    the logic of how to render that component? react does exactly that. React lets
    you declare how you want your UI element to look like and abstracts out low-level
    DOM manipulation APIs. Apart from this very useful abstraction, react does something
    pretty smart to solve the performance problem as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React uses something called a Virtual DOM. A virtual DOM is a lightweight abstraction
    of the HTML DOM. You can think of it as a local in-memory copy of the HTML DOM.
    React uses it to do all computations necessary to render the state of a UI component.

    abstraction that makes composition, unidirectional dataflow, and static modeling
    easier while developing large applications.

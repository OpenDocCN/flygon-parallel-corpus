  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Building a progressive web app is, for the most part, a frontend process. PWAs
    care little for how they consume data from a backend API (unless it impedes performance,
    of course). We want to keep the backend setup for our application minimal; for
    that, we turn to Firebase.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Firebase** is a project by Google designed to help developers build apps
    without worrying about backend infrastructure. It operates on the freemium model,
    based on the amount of requests your backend has to respond to as well as the
    amount of storage you need. For our purposes, it is the perfect fit for quickly
    developing a small prototype. When our app scales, the Chatastrophe executive
    board assures us, "money won''t be an issue."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What does Firebase provide? Of interest to us is a database, a hosting solution,
    and built-in authentication. Beyond that, it also offers something called **Cloud
    Functions**, which are snippets of code automatically run in response to certain
    events. We'll be working with Cloud Functions once we add push notifications to
    our application. For now, we want to add some authentication to our login form
    so that users can sign up and log in to Chatastrophe.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a Google account (via Google Plus or Gmail, for example) you can
    log in to Firebase with those credentials, or create a new account; that's all
    we need to get started.

- en: Firebase is a useful tool, but it does have some caveats.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the big selling points (for us especially) is its real-time database.
    This means that changes to the data by one user are automatically pushed to all
    users. We don't have to check whether a new chat message has been created; each
    instance of the application will be instantly informed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The database also has offline persistence, which means our users can read their
    messages even when they're offline (which, if you remember, fulfills one of the
    user stories we outlined earlier). Firebase uses local caching to achieve this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what's the downside? The Firebase database is a NoSQL database, and has
    a specific syntax that may seem strange to developers more used to SQL databases.
    The process is similar to a SQL database (with the major **CRUD** actions--**Create**,
    **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**-- applying to data), but it may not be as
    intuitive.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other gotcha with Firebase is that it is not (at the time of writing) optimized
    for **Single-Page Applications** (**SPAs**) like those built with React. We'll
    have to do a couple of workarounds to get everything running smoothly with our
    React application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All that said, however, Firebase will save us a lot of time in comparison to
    setting up our own backend server/hosting solution, and it's a pleasure to use
    for personal projects; this is definitely something worth learning.

    shorthand. Basically, when you''re assigned a key to a variable, and the key and
    the variable should have the same name, you can save time instead of typing `this.setState({
    user: user })`.'

- en: Note the `if` statement. `onAuthStateChanged` is also called when the user logs
    out, in which case the user argument will be null. We can set `this.state.user`
    to null, but let's keep it simple and let the user persist in state until the
    next user comes along.

- en: Another bonus to Firebase authentication is that it takes care of persistent
    login for us. This means that a user won't have to log in every time they come
    to our app; Firebase will load their logged-in state automatically, until they
    click on sign out (which we'll add in the future). In accordance with this, `onAuthStateChanged`
    will be called every time that a user visits our app, whether they physically
    log in or are already logged in. Therefore, we can rely on our user object always
    being saved in state if the user is logged in.

- en: You can try it by logging out the user in the callback of `onAuthStateChanged`
    with `firebase.auth().signOut();`. Try logging in again, and then refreshing the
    page; you should see the user object appear no matter how many times you refresh,
    as you are automatically logged in.

    between React components? How do we change the content of our app in accordance
    with the URL? All that and more is coming up next!'

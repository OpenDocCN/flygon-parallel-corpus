    analysis, and predictive modeling on large-scale datasets. The rapid growth of
    information and technological developments has provided a unique opportunity for
    individuals and enterprises across the world to derive profits and develop new
    capabilities redefining traditional business models using large-scale analytics.
    This chapter aims at providing a gentle overview of the salient characteristics
    of big data to form a foundation for subsequent chapters that will delve deeper
    into the various aspects of big data analytics.

    Strozzi NoSQL opensource relational database. In the late 2000s, new paradigms
    in database architecture emerged, many of which did not adhere to the strict constraints
    required of relational database systems. These databases, due to their non-conformity
    with standard database conventions such as ACID compliance, were soon grouped
    under a broad category known as NoSQL.

    over a *network* which, by nature can be disrupted, partition tolerance has to
    be guaranteed in order for the system to continue performing normally. In this
    case, the contention lies with choosing between consistency and availability.
    For example, if the system has to be consistent; that is, show the most recent
    commit across all nodes, all the nodes cannot be *available* all at the same time
    as some nodes might not have the most recent commit. In this case, a query on
    a new update will not execute until all nodes have been updated with the new data.
    In case of availability, in similar terms, we cannot guarantee consistency, since
    to be available at all times means that some nodes will not have the same data
    as another node if a new update has not been written onto the respective node.

    databases that epitomized the benefits of storing data in a columnar format rather
    than using the more common row-based layout. Although columnar databases such

    This is a very high-level generalization of the exact process as there are conditions
    under which the CPU does not need to send an instruction to read data from memory
    (such as when the data is already present in the CPU L2 Cache - a part of the
    CPU that contains memory reserved for caching data), but fundamentally the process
    is linear between the CPU, RAM, and disk.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data that is stored on disk can be transferred to the memory at a certain rate
    that is dependent on the I/O (Input/Output) throughput of the disk. It takes approximately
    10-20 milliseconds (ms) to access data from disk. While the exact number varies
    depending on the size of the data, the minimum seek time (time for the disk to
    find the location of the data) in itself is approximately 10-15 ms. Compare this
    with the time it takes to fetch data from memory, which is approximately 100 nanoseconds.
    Finally, it takes approximately 7 ns to read data from the CPU L2 Cache.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To put this into perspective, the disk access time of 15 milliseconds, namely,
    15,000,000 nanoseconds is 150,000 times *slower* than the time it takes to access
    data from memory. In other words, data that is already present in memory can be
    read at an astounding 150 thousand times faster relative to disk. This is essentially
    true of reading random data. The time to read sequential data is arguably less
    sensational, but still nearly an order of magnitude faster.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, it is natural to conclude from this that if the data were stored in RAM,
    especially in the case of larger datasets, the access time would be dramatically
    lower, and consequently the time to process the data (at least on the I/O level)
    would be significantly reduced.

- en: Traditionally, all data in terms of databases was stored on disk. With the advent
    of the internet, the industry started leveraging *memcached,* which provided a
    means to store data in key-value pairs in memory via an API. For example, it was,
    and still is, common for MySQL databases to leverage the memcached API to cache
    objects in memory to optimize read speeds as well as reduce the load on the primary
    (MySQL) database.
  prefs: []

    and memcached method started to take it's toll, and databases that were exclusively
    designed to store data in memory (and sometimes both on disk and in memory) were

    platforms are used for business-critical areas. For instance, credit card companies
    use graph databases to find new products that an individual cardholder may be
    interested in by querying across millions of datapoints to assess purchasing behavior
    of other cardholders with similar purchasing patterns. Social network websites
    use graph databases to compute similarity scores, provide friend suggestions,
    and other related metrics.

    numerous elements of NoSQL systems (generally known as multi-modal databases),
    in practice, a single solution that performs universally well across a broad set
    of use cases is rare. In real-world use cases, companies generally implement more
    than one solution to meet data mining needs. In the next section, we will complete

    to another. In general, ODBC connectors are used to transfer data between database
    systems. Another common format is CSV files with the data represented as comma-separated
    values. CSV files are optimal for structured data that doesn't contain more complex
    data structures such as nested values. In such cases, JSON provides an optimal
    and structured way to capture and preserve information using a key-value pair
    syntax.

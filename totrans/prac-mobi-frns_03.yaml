    must understand the internal components and inner workings of that device. Developing
    an understanding of the underlying components of a mobile device will help you
    understand the criticalities involved in the forensic process, including what
    data can be acquired, where the data is stored, and what methods can be used to
    access the data from that device. So, before we delve into the examination of
    iOS devices, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the different models
    that exist and their internal components. Throughout this book, we will perform
    forensic acquisition and analysis on iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPad,
    and Apple Watch.

    previously stated in this chapter, knowing the iPhone's details helps you to understand
    the criticalities and possibilities of obtaining evidence from it. You must know
    the model of the device to ensure that the tools and methodologies being deployed
    support that particular iPhone. Additionally, the internal storage size of the
    iPhone must be determined to ensure that the evidence container is large enough
    for the entire forensic image. Most tools will not alert you if there is not enough
    disk space on the evidence drive until space has run out. This will waste time
    and force you to acquire the device a second time. Finally, the network capabilities
    of the device must also be noted so that you can properly isolate the device to
    prevent remote accessing or wiping during the examination. This will be discussed
    further in [Chapter 3](6bdeccbc-e651-43f3-b5ed-4e6d071adec6.xhtml), *Data Acquisition

- en: Again, some familiarity with iPhone device hardware will aid you in determining
    how to handle the device during a forensic investigation. Certain models enforce
    full-disk encryption, while older models do not. Encrypted devices require additional
    steps during an acquisition—if access is even possible. You must be prepared for
    all hurdles you may be required to clear during the acquisition and analytical
    stages of the investigation. In addition to this, knowing the capabilities that
    the iPhone has—and the initial and current iOS version—makes a difference in the
    data you will be able to recover from the device. Apple is not consistent with
    data storage locations across iOS versions. Therefore, you must know the original
    version installed when the phone was first in use to ensure that the forensic
    tools do not overlook data that could aid in the investigation.

- en: To better understand the forensic process of an iOS device, it is useful to
    know about the filesystem that is used. Originally, the filesystem used in the
    iPhone and other Apple iOS devices was HFSX. This is a variation of HFS Plus,
    with one major difference. HFSX is case-sensitive, whereas HFS Plus is case-insensitive.
    Other differences will be discussed later in this chapter. APFS was introduced
    in June 2016 as a replacement for HFS Plus and became the default filesystem for
    iOS devices with the release of iOS 10.3, and for macOS devices with the release
    of macOS 10.13.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In 1996, Apple developed a new filesystem, HFS, to accommodate the storage of
    large datasets. In an HFS filesystem, the storage medium is represented as volumes.
    HFS volumes are divided into logical blocks of 512 bytes. The logical blocks are
    numbered from first to last on a given volume and will remain static with the
    same size as physical blocks—that is, 512 bytes. These logical blocks are grouped
    together into allocation blocks, which are used by the HFS filesystem to track
    data in a more efficient way. HFS uses a 16-bit value to address allocation blocks,
    which limits the number of allocation blocks to 65,535\. To overcome the inefficient
    allocation of disk space and some of the limitations of HFS, Apple introduced
    the HFS Plus filesystem ([http://dubeiko.com/development/FileSystems/HFSPLUS/tn1150.html](http://dubeiko.com/development/FileSystems/HFSPLUS/tn1150.html)).

    on HFS volumes are usually 512 bytes in size. These sectors form allocation blocks.
    The number of such blocks depends on the size of the volume. HFS Plus uses block
    addresses of 32 bits to address allocation blocks. HFS Plus uses *journaling*
    by default. Journaling is the process of logging every transaction to the disk,
    which helps prevent filesystem corruption. The key characteristics of the HFS
    Plus filesystem include the following: efficient use of disk space, Unicode support
    for filenames, support for name forks, file compression, journaling, dynamic resizing,
    dynamic defragmentation, and an ability to boot on OSes other than macOS.'

    If the iOS device is jailbroken, the files containing information regarding the

    high-level OS features prevent unauthorized use. A brief overview of the iOS security
    features is provided in the following sections.

    each time you turn on or wake up the device, it will ask for the passcode to access
    the device. iOS devices support simple as well as complex passcodes. iOS 9 released
    the option to use a six-digit simple passcode instead of the legacy four-digit
    option. The iPhone 5S and later also supports Touch ID fingerprints as a passcode,
    which are backed up with a simple or complex passcode. The iPhone X and later
    support a new biometric way of locking the device—Face ID—so that users can use
    their faces as the passcodes. And it's even more secure, as the chance that a
    stranger will unlock your iPhone with Touch ID is 1 in 50,000, but with Face ID
    it is 1 in 1,000,000.

    into a tightly restricted area. Applications installed on the iOS device are sandboxed,
    and one application cannot access the data stored by another. Essentially, a sandbox
    is a mechanism that enforces fine-grained controls that limit an application's
    access to files, network resources, hardware, and more.

- en: On iOS devices (starting with the iPhone 4), the entire filesystem is encrypted
    with a filesystem key, which is computed from the device's unique hardware key.
    This key is stored in effaceable storage, which exists between the OS and hardware
    levels of the device. This is the reason that **Joint Test Action Group** (**JTAG**)
    and chip-off methods are not useful acquisition methods, as the entire data dump
    will be encrypted.

- en: Data protection is designed to protect data at rest and to make offline attacks
    difficult. It allows applications to leverage the user's device passcode, in concert
    with the device hardware encryption, to generate a strong encryption key. Later,
    the strong encryption key is used to encrypt the data stored on the disk. This
    key protects data from unauthorized access when the device is locked, so critical
    information is secured even if the device is compromised.

    distinguish the portions of memory that are executable code from data. For example,
    in a code injection attack, an attacker tries to inject a vector and execute it.
    But DEP prevents this because it recognizes the injected part as data and not
    code.

- en: iOS provides the Erase All Content and Settings option to wipe the data on an
    iPhone. This type of data wipe erases user settings and information by removing
    the encryption keys that protect the data. As the encryption keys are erased from
    the device, it is not possible to recover the deleted data, not even during forensic
    investigations. Other wiping methods are available that overwrite the data in
    the device memory. More information on wiping can be found at [https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201274](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201274).

    the App Store.

    Developers use Xcode and the iOS **software development kit** (**SDK**) to develop
    applications. Later, they submit the app to Apple for approval. Apple follows
    an extensive review process to check the app against the company's guidelines.
    If Apple approves the app, it is published to the App Store, where users can download
    or buy it. The strict review process makes the App Store less prone to malware,
    but not 100% secure.

    through the use of software and hardware exploits. Jailbreaking permits unsigned
    code to run and gain root access on the OS. The most common reason for jailbreaking
    is to expand the limited feature set imposed by Apple's App Store and to install
    unapproved apps. Jailbreaking can aid in forensic acquisition but will void the
    user's warranty, potentially *brick* the device, and may not support being restored
    to the factory settings.

    the device model. The model of an iOS device can be used to help you as the examiner
    develop an understanding of the underlying components and capabilities of the
    device, which can be used to drive the methods for acquisition and examination.
    Legacy iOS devices should not be disregarded, because they may surface as part
    of an investigation. You must be aware of all iOS devices, as old devices are
    sometimes still in use and may be tied to a criminal investigation.

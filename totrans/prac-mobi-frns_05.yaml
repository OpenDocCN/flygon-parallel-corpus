- en: In the previous chapter, we covered techniques to acquire data from an iOS device,
    which included logical and filesystem acquisition. This chapter covers techniques
    to acquire a backup of files from the device onto a computer or iCloud, using
    Apple's synchronization protocol.

- en: The physical acquisition of an iOS device provides the most data in an investigation,
    but you can also find a wealth of information in iOS backups. iOS device users
    have several options to back up the data present on their devices. Users can choose
    to back up the data to their computer, using the Apple iTunes software, or to
    the Apple cloud storage service known as iCloud. Every time an iPhone is synced
    with a computer or to iCloud, it creates a backup by copying the selected files
    from the device. The user can determine what is contained in the backup, so some
    backups may be more inclusive than others. Also, the user can back up to both
    a computer and iCloud and the data derived from each location may differ. This
    often occurs due to the limitations of iCloud's free storage. The user may simply
    back up photos and contacts to iCloud but may take a complete backup of all the
    data on their computer. As previously mentioned, physical acquisition provides
    the best access to all data on the iOS device; however, backups may be the only
    available source of digital evidence, especially if we are dealing with the most
    recent iOS devices.

- en: A wealth of information is stored on any computer that has been previously synced
    with an iOS device. These computers, commonly referred to as host computers, can
    have historical data and passcode bypass certificates. In a criminal investigation,
    a search warrant can be obtained to seize a computer that belongs to a suspect,
    in order to access the backup and lockdown certificates. For all other cases,
    consent or permissible access is required. iOS backup file forensics mainly involves
    analyzing an offline backup produced by an iPhone or an iPad. Apple Watch data
    will be contained within the iPhone backup to which it is synced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The iTunes backup method is also useful in cases where other acquisition types
    are not feasible. In this situation, you essentially create an iTunes backup of
    the device and analyze it using forensic software. Thus, it is important for you
    to completely understand the backup process and the tools involved, to ensure
    tools are capable of creating a forensic backup without contaminating the devices
    with other existing data in iTunes.

- en: iPhone backup files can be created using the iTunes software, which is available
    for the macOS and Windows platforms. iTunes is a free utility provided by Apple
    for data synchronization and management between iOS devices and the computer.
    iTunes uses Apple's proprietary synchronization protocol to copy data from the
    iOS device to a computer. For example, an iPhone can be synced with a computer
    using a cable or Wi-Fi. iTunes provides an option for an encrypted backup, but,
    by default, it creates an unencrypted backup whenever an iPhone is synced. Encrypted
    backups, when cracked, provide additional access to data stored on the iOS device.
    This will be discussed later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Users often create backup files to protect their data in the event that their
    device is damaged or lost. Either a forensic backup is created to act as the best
    evidence or data is simply extracted from existing iOS backup files to search
    for legacy information. For example, if you are under investigation and you delete
    files or wipe your iPhone, your backup files on your iCloud and your Mac still
    exist. Depending on whether iTunes or iCloud was used, multiple backups for the
    same device may exist. You will have to analyze each backup forensically to uncover
    artifacts relating to the investigation.

    the iOS device is connected to the computer. To avoid unintended data exchange
    between the iOS device and the computer, disable the automatic synchronization
    process before connecting your evidence to the forensic workstation. The screenshot
    in *Step 2* of the following process illustrates the option that disables automatic
    syncing in iTunes version 12.9.4.102.

    backup of the device. Currently, on subsequent syncs, iTunes only backs up the
    files that are modified on the device and updates the existing backup directory.
    This has not always been true since, in the past, a new backup was created every
    time the iOS device was backed up. Also, when a device is updated or restored,
    iTunes automatically initiates a backup and takes a *differential backup*. A differential
    backup has the same name as the backup directory but is appended with a dash (`-`),
    the **International Organization for Standardization** (**ISO**) date of the backup,
    a dash (`-`), and the time in a 24-hour format with seconds (`[UDID]+ '-' + [Date]+'-'+[Time

    Standard-256** (**AES-256**) algorithm in the **Cipher Block Chaining** (**CBC**)
    mode, with a unique key and a null **initialization vector** (**IV**). The unique
    file keys are protected with a set of class keys from `Backup keybag`. The class
    keys in `Backup keybag` are protected with a key derived from the password set
    in iTunes through 10,000 iterations of the **Password-Based Key Derivation Function
    2** (**PBKDF2**). In iOS 10.2 this mechanism was upgraded, so now, there are 10,000,000

    commercial tool from Elcomsoft, developed for the Windows platform. The tool can
    decrypt an encrypted backup file when the backup password is not available. The
    tool provides an option to launch a password brute-force attack on the encrypted
    backup if the backup password is not available. Elcomsoft Phone Breaker tries
    to recover the plain-text password that protects the encrypted backup, using a
    dictionary and brute-force attacks. Passwords that are relatively short and simple
    can be recovered in a reasonable amount of time. However, if the backup is protected
    with a strong and complex password, breaking it can take forever.'

    October 2011\. The service allows users to keep data such as calendars, contacts,
    reminders, photos, documents, bookmarks, applications, notes, and more in sync
    across multiple compatible devices (iOS devices running with iOS 5 or later; computers
    with macOS X 10.7.2 or later; and Microsoft Windows), using a centralized iCloud
    account. The service also allows users to wirelessly and automatically back up
    their iOS devices to iCloud. iCloud also provides other services, such as *Find
    My iPhone* (to track a lost phone and wipe it remotely) and *Find My Friends*(to
    share locations with friends and notify the user when a device arrives at a certain
    location).

    you sign up for iCloud, Apple grants you access to 5 GB of free remote storage.
    If you need more storage, you can purchase the upgrade plan. To keep your data
    secure, Apple forces users to choose a strong password when creating an Apple
    ID to use with iCloud. The password must have a minimum of eight characters, including
    a number, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter.

    to iTunes and choosing the iCloud option. iCloud backups are incremental; that
    is, once the initial iCloud backup is completed, all the subsequent backups only
    copy the files that are changed on the device. iCloud secures your data by encrypting
    it when it is transmitted over the internet, storing it in an encrypted format
    on the server, and using secure tokens for authentication.

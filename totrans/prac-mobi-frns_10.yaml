- en: In the previous chapter, we covered the fundamentals of the Android architecture,
    security features, filesystems, and other capabilities. Having an established
    forensic environment before the start of an examination is important, as it ensures
    that the data is protected while you, as the examiner, maintain control of the
    workstation. This chapter will explain the process of—and what to consider when—setting
    up a digital forensic examination environment. It is paramount that you maintain
    control of the forensic environment at all times; this prevents the introduction
    of contaminants that could affect the forensic investigation.

    and work with the connected device. The issue is that, since Android is allowed
    to be modified and customized by manufacturers, there is no single generic driver
    that works for all Android devices. Each manufacturer writes its own proprietary
    drivers and distributes them over the internet, so it's important to identify
    the specific device drivers that need to be installed. Of course, some Android
    forensic toolkits (which we will discuss in the following chapters) do come with
    some generic drivers or a set of the most widely used drivers; they may not work

    to make sure that remote wipe options do not work on the device. The Android Device
    Manager allows the phone to be remotely wiped or locked. This can be done by signing
    in to the Google account, which is configured on the mobile. More details about
    this are supplied in the following section. If the Android device is not set up
    to allow remote wiping, the device can only be locked using the Android Device
    Manager. There are also several **mobile device management** (**MDM**) software

    those found on the SD card. To isolate the device from the network, you can put
    the device in airplane mode and disable Wi-Fi as an extra precaution. Enabling
    airplane mode and disabling Wi-Fi works well, as the device will not be able to
    communicate over a cellular network and cannot be accessed via Wi-Fi. Removing
    the SIM card from the phone is also an option, but that does not effectively stop
    the device from communicating over Wi-Fi or other cellular networks. To place
    the device in airplane mode, press and hold the Power Off button and select Airplane

    is present. The two main functions of recovery are deleting all user data and
    installing updates. For instance, when you factory-reset your phone, recovery
    boots up and deletes all the data. Similarly, when updates are to be installed

    device with a modified image. The fastboot utility facilitates this process. Fastboot
    is a diagnostic protocol that comes with the SDK package and is used primarily
    to modify the flash filesystem through a USB connection from a host computer.
    For this, you need to start the device in boot loader mode, in which only the
    most basic hardware initialization is performed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    commands that are sent to it via the USB cable using a command line. Flashing
    or rewriting a partition with a binary image stored on the computer is one such
    command that is allowed. Once the recovery is flashed, boot the device in recovery
    mode, mount the `/data` and `/system` partitions, and use `adb` to remove the
    `gesture.key` file. Reboot the phone and you should be able to bypass the screen
    lock; however, this works only if the device bootloader is unlocked. Also, flashing
    permanently alters the device. Instead of flashing, you could use the fastboot
    `boot` command to boot to a recovery image temporarily to delete the key file
    without permanently changing the recovery partition.

    to any forensic examiner, like you, trying to get access to the data on an Android
    device; however, there could be situations where none of these techniques work.
    To obtain a complete physical image of the device, techniques such as chip-off
    and JTAG may be required when commercial and open source solutions fail. A short
    description of these techniques is included here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the chip-off technique removes the memory chip from a circuit and tries
    to read it, the JTAG technique involves probing the JTAG **test access ports**
    (**TAPs**) and soldering connectors to the JTAG ports in order to read data from
    the device memory. The chip-off technique is more destructive because, once the
    chip is removed from a device, it is difficult to restore the device to its original
    functional state. Also, expertise is needed to carefully remove the chip from
    the device by desoldering the chip from the circuit board. The heat required to
    remove the chip can also damage or destroy the data stored on that chip, which
    means that this technique should be used only when the data is not retrievable
    by open source or commercial tools or the device is damaged beyond repair. When
    using the JTAG technique, JTAG ports help you to access the memory chip to retrieve
    a physical image of the data without needing to remove the chip. To turn off screen
    lock on a device, you can identify where the lock code is stored in the physical
    memory dump, turn off the locking, and copy that data back to the device. Commercial
    tools, such as Cellebrite Physical Analyzer, can accept `.bin` files from chip-off
    and JTAG acquisitions and crack the lock code for you. Once the code is either
    manually removed or cracked, you can analyze the device using normal techniques.

    that relates to twisting and tweaking the device. This will help you to understand
    the internal workings of the device in detail and understand many issues that
    you may face during your investigation. Rooting Android phones has become a common
    phenomenon, and you can expect to encounter rooted phones during forensic examinations.
    Where applicable, you may also need to root the device in order to acquire data
    for forensic examination. This means that it's important to know the ins and outs
    of rooted devices and how they are different from other phones. The following
    sections cover information about Android rooting and other related concepts.

    **root**. In Linux, the root user has the power to start/stop any system service,
    edit/delete any file, change the privileges of other users, and so on. We have
    already learned that Android uses the Linux kernel, and so most Linux concepts are
    applicable to Android as well; however, most Android phones do not let you log
    in as a root user by default.

    actions that are not normally allowed on the device. Manufacturers want devices
    to function in a certain manner for normal users. Rooting a device may void a
    warranty, since using root opens the system to vulnerabilities and provides the
    user with superuser capabilities.

    root access. Remember that, in Android, each application is treated as a separate
    user and is issued a UID. This means that applications have access to limited
    resources and the concept of application isolation is enforced. Essentially, rooting
    an Android device allows superuser capabilities and provides open access to the
    Android device.
  prefs: []

    and give privileged access to perform actions that may not be done by a normal
    user. In mobiles, this superuser access is disabled by design, but rooting a phone
    allows you to gain this privilege.

    access to the root, hackers have always found different ways to get access to
    the root. The process of rooting varies depending on the underlying device manufacturer;
    however, rooting any device usually involves exploiting a security bug in the
    device's firmware, then copying the `su` (superuser) binary to a location in the
    current process's path (`/system/xbin/su`), and granting it executable permissions
    with the `chmod` command.

    runs when the phone is powered on. The primary job of this boot loader is to boot
    other partitions and load the Android partition, commonly referred to as ROM by
    default. To see the boot loader menu, a specific key combination is required,
    such as holding the power button and pressing the volume up button. This menu
    provides options for you to boot into other partitions, such as the recovery partition.

    means that bypassing this restriction would allow you to install/flash any unlocked
    Android ROM. Modified recovery programs are those that not only allow an easier
    rooting process, but also provide various options that are not seen in the normal

    on devices. Verified boot guarantees that the software on the device is not modified
    before booting into the normal mode. This is implemented in such a way that each
    stage verifies the integrity and authenticity of the next stage before executing
    it. If a particular partition or segment is modified, the integrity check fails
    and the mobile may not boot into normal mode. More information about verified
    boot can be found at [https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot).

    The primary factor that influences your choice of method is whether the underlying
    boot loader is locked or unlocked. Gaining root access on a device with an unlocked
    boot loader is very easy, while gaining root access to a device with a locked
    boot loader is not so straightforward, which means that unlocking your Android
    phone’s bootloader is often the first step to rooting and flashing custom ROMs.
    This can be done either through fastboot mode (discussed in earlier sections)
    or by following a vendor-specific boot loader unlock procedure. Once the device
    bootloader is unlocked, the next step is to copy the `su` binary and grant it
    executable permissions. This can be done in many ways.

    unlocked, you need to determine the best method by which to gain access to the
    device. If the device has the USB debugging feature enabled, then bypassing the
    screen-lock is just a cakewalk. We learned about the various screen lock bypass
    techniques and helped you to determine which one to use under different circumstances.
    Depending on the forensic acquisition method and the scope of the investigation,
    rooting the device should provide complete access to the files present on the

    or internal investigations done as part of a corporate company''s internal probe.
    While dealing with investigations involving Android devices, you, as the forensic
    examiner, need to be mindful of the issues that need to be taken care of during
    the forensic process; this includes determining whether root access is permitted
    (via consent or legal authority) and what data can be extracted and analyzed during
    the investigation. For example, in a criminal case involving stalking, the court
    may only allow SMS, call logs, and photos to be extracted and analyzed on the
    Android device belonging to the suspect. In this case, it may make the most sense
    to logically capture only those specific items. However, it is best to obtain
    a full physical data extraction from the device and only examine the areas admissible
    by the court. You never know where your investigation may lead and it is best
    to obtain as much data from the device as possible immediately, rather than wishing
    you had a full image should the scope of consent change. Data extraction techniques
    on an Android device can be classified into three types:'

    involves browsing through the device normally and capturing any valuable information,

    and erase or add data. Manual extraction should be used as the last resort to
    verify findings extracted using one of the other methods. Certain circumstances
    may warrant you to conduct a manual examination as the first step. This may include
    cases of life or death situations or missing persons where a quick scan of the

    interacting with the operating system and accessing the filesystem. These techniques
    are significant because they provide valuable data, work on most devices, and
    are easy to use. Once again, the concept of rooting comes into the picture while
    extracting the data. Logical techniques do not actually require root access for
    data extraction. However, having root access on a device allows you to access
    all of the files present on a device. This means that some data may be extracted
    on a non-rooted device while root access will open the device and provide access
    to all of the files present on the device. Hence, having root access to a device
    would greatly influence the amount and kind of data that could be extracted through
    logical techniques. The following sections explain various techniques that can
    be used to extract data logically from an Android device.

- en: In Android, the data of one application cannot be accessed by another application
    under normal circumstances. However, Android provides a mechanism through which
    data can be shared with other applications. This is precisely achieved through
    the use of content providers. Content providers present data to external applications
    in the form of one or more tables. These tables are no different from the tables
    found in a relational database. They can be used by applications to share data,
    usually through the URI addressing scheme. They are used by other applications
    that access the provider using a provider-client object. During the installation
    of an app, the user determines whether or not the app can gain access to the requested
    data (content providers). For instance, contacts, SMS/MMS, and a calendar are
    examples of content providers.

- en: Physical extraction refers to the process of obtaining an exact bit-by-bit image
    of a device. It is important to understand that a bit-by-bit image is not the
    same as copying and pasting the contents of a device. If we copy and paste the
    contents of a device, it will only copy the available files, such as visible files,
    hidden files, and system-related files. This method is considered a logical image.
    With this method, deleted files and files that are not accessible are not copied
    by the `copy` command. Deleted files can be recovered (based on the circumstances)
    using certain techniques, which we will see in the following chapters. Unlike
    logical extraction, physical extraction is an exact copy of the device's memory
    and includes more information, such as the slack space and unallocated space.

    the `dd` command, while other advanced techniques such as JTAG and chip-off are

    and experience to try them on real devices during the course of an investigation.
    As with any other technique, if an individual performs these procedures incorrectly,
    data on the device can be corrupted or become irretrievable, thereby making it
    non-admissible in a court of law. JTAG and chip-off techniques are covered in
    detail in the following sections. However, extracting data through the `dd` command
    requires root access. The following sections provide an overview of various techniques

- en: Imaging a device is one of the most important steps in mobile device forensics.
    When possible, it's imperative to obtain a physical image of an Android device
    before performing any techniques to extract the data directly from the device.
    In forensics, this process of obtaining a physical acquisition is commonly called
    *imaging the device*. The terms physical image, forensic image, and raw image
    are often used to refer to the image captured through this process. Let's first
    revisit how imaging is done on a desktop computer as it helps us to correlate
    and realize the problems associated with imaging Android devices. Let's assume
    that a desktop computer, which is not powered on, is seized from a suspect and
    sent for forensic examination. In this case, a typical forensic examiner would
    remove the hard disk, connect it to a write blocker, and obtain a bit-by-bit forensic
    image using any of the available tools. The original hard disk is then safely
    protected during the forensic imaging of the data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With an Android device, all of the areas that contain data cannot be easily
    removed. Also, if the device is active at the time of receiving it for examination,
    it is not possible to analyze the device without making any changes to it, because
    any interaction would change the state of the device.
  prefs: []

- en: 'An Android device may have two file storage areas: internal and external storage.
    Internal storage refers to the built-in non-volatile memory. External storage
    refers to the removable storage medium, such as a micro SD card. However, it''s
    important to note that some devices do not have a removable storage medium such
    as an SD card, but they divide the available permanent storage space into internal
    and external storage. Hence, it''s not always true that external storage is removable.
    When a removable SD card is present, a forensic image of the memory card has to
    be obtained. As discussed in [Chapter 7](eb3f20e0-270d-4e7d-bb69-3bfd1e707f38.xhtml),
    *Understanding Android*, these removable cards are generally formatted with the
    FAT32 filesystem. Some mobile device acquisition methods will acquire the SD card
    through the Android device. This process, while useful, will be slow due to the
    speed limitations of USB phone cables.'

- en: Android, by default, does not provide access to internal directories and system-related
    files. This restricted access is to ensure the security of the device. For instance,
    the `/data/data` folder is not accessible on a non-rooted device. This folder
    is especially of interest to us because it stores most of the user-created data
    and many applications write valuable data into this folder. Hence, to obtain an
    image of the device, we need to root the Android device. Rooting a device gives
    us superuser privileges and access to all of the data. It is important to realize
    that this book has been stressing that all of the steps taken should be forensically
    sound and should not make changes to the device whenever possible. Rooting an
    Android device will make changes to it and should be tested on any device that
    you have not previously investigated. Rooting is common for Android devices, but
    getting root access could alter the device in a manner that renders the data changed
    or—worse yet—wiped. Some Android devices, such as the Nexus 4 and 5, may force
    the data partition to be wiped before allowing root access. This negates the need
    to root the device to gain access because all of the user data is lost during
    the process. Just remember that, while rooting provides access to more data when
    successfully done, it can also wipe data or destroy the phone. Hence, you must
    ensure that you have consent or legal rights to manipulate an Android device before
    proceeding with the root. As rooting techniques have been discussed in [Chapter
    8](b1621e6e-80a3-495e-a288-c8db601149f8.xhtml), *Android Forensic Setup and Pre-Data
    Extraction Techniques*, we will proceed with the example assuming that the device

    done by inserting the chip into the hardware device, that supports the specific
    NAND flash chip. In this process, raw data is acquired from the chip, resulting
    in a `.bin` file.

- en: The chip-off technique is most helpful when a device is damaged severely, locked,
    or otherwise inaccessible. However, the application of this technique requires
    not only expertise but also costly equipment and tools. There is always a risk
    of damaging the NAND flash while removing it and, hence, it is recommended to
    try out the logical techniques first to extract any data.

    it must be noted here that, at the time of writing this book, none of these techniques
    would work on devices that have **Full Disk Encryption** (**FDE**) enabled. As
    discussed in [Chapter 7](eb3f20e0-270d-4e7d-bb69-3bfd1e707f38.xhtml), *Understanding
    Android*, Google has mandated the use of FDE for most devices starting from Android
    6.0\. Although some techniques were demonstrated and published for decrypting
    full disk encryption, they are device-specific and are not widely applicable.

- en: This chapter covered various manual, logical, and physical data extraction techniques.
    We learned when and how to apply these techniques during the course of an investigation.
    Logical techniques extract data by interacting with the device using tools such
    as ADB. Physical techniques, on the other hand, access a larger set of data; they
    are complex and require a great deal of expertise to perform. Imaging a device
    produces a bit-by-bit image of the device, which is later analyzed using tools.
    Imaging a device is one of the primary steps to ensure that the data on the device
    is not modified. Android 7.0 and above poses a new challenge to forensic investigators
    by bringing in new security features and file paths that may limit acquisition.
    With this knowledge, you can perform device acquisition to extract relevant data
    from an Android device.

    text messages, and browsing history from an image file. We will also cover data
    recovery techniques, using which we can recover data deleted from a device.

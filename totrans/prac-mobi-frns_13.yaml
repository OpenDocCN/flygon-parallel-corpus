    download and install several apps from app stores such as Google Play. During
    forensic investigations, it is often helpful to perform an analysis of these apps
    to retrieve valuable data and to detect any malware. For instance, a photo vault
    app might lock sensitive images present on a device. Hence, it would be of great
    significance to have the knowledge to identify the passcode for the photo vault
    app.

    days, and they are often the source of valuable data that aids in cracking a case.
    Hence, it is important to know what kind of data these apps store and the location
    of this data. While the data extraction and data recovery techniques we discussed
    in earlier chapters provide access to valuable data, app analysis helps us gain
    information about the specifics of an application, such as preferences and permissions.

- en: On Android, everything the user interacts with is an application. While some
    apps are preinstalled by the device manufacturer, others are downloaded and installed
    by the user. For example, even routine functions, such as contacts, calls, SMS,
    and so on, are performed through their respective apps. Thus, Android app analysis
    is crucial during the course of an investigation. Several third-party apps, such
    as WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, Chrome browser, and so on, are used widely, and
    they handle a lot of valuable information. Depending on the type of application,
    most of these apps store sensitive information on the device's internal memory
    or SD card. Analyzing them may provide information about the location details
    of the user, their communication with others, and more. Using the forensic techniques
    we described earlier, it is possible to get access to the data stored by these
    applications. However, you, as a forensic examiner, need to develop the necessary
    skills to convert the available data into useful data. This is achieved when you
    have a comprehensive understanding of how the application handles data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we discussed in previous chapters, all applications store their data in the
    `/data/data` folder by default. Apps also store certain other data on the SD card,
    if they want to, by asking permission at the time of installation. Information
    about applications present on the device can be gathered by inspecting the contents
    of the `/data/data` folder, but this is not straightforward as it requires analyzing
    each individual app folder under this path. As an alternative, you can inspect
    the `packages.list` file present under `/data/system`. This file contains information
    about all the apps, along with their package names and data paths.

    pictures and videos stored in the gallery, you first need to enter the passcode

    at Android users. Mobile malware is a broad term that refers to a piece of software
    that performs unintended actions and includes Trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware,
    and others. According to pandasecurity, Android devices are 50 times more infected
    with malware compared to iOS devices ([https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/mobile-security/android-more-infected-than-ios/](https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/mobile-security/android-more-infected-than-ios/)).
    In 2019, the famous Agent Smith malware alone infected almost 25 million Android
    devices, as per a Cybersecurity Hub news report ([https://www.cshub.com/malware/articles/incident-of-the-week-malware-infects-25m-android-phones](https://www.cshub.com/malware/articles/incident-of-the-week-malware-infects-25m-android-phones)).

    which is tightly controlled by the company, Google's Play Store is an open ecosystem
    without any detailed upfront security reviews. Malware developers can easily move
    their apps to the Play Store and thereby distribute their apps. Google now has
    a malware-detecting software named Google Bouncer, which will automatically scan
    an uploaded app for malware, but attackers have figured out several ways to remain
    undetected. Moreover, Android officially allows us to load apps that have been
    downloaded over the internet (side-loading), unlike iOS, which does not allow
    unsigned apps.

    that may be of interest to the attacker. BusyGasper, a spyware identified by Kaspersky
    Lab experts in early 2018, not only possesses common spyware capabilities, such

    unwanted programs are not always harmless, since popups may result in downloading

    banking Trojans.'

    malicious application now functions exactly as the legitimate application does,

    of MMS, the malware is attached to the message, just like how computer viruses
    are sent through email attachments. However, in both these methods, the user has

    installed does not contain any malicious code, but a function present within the
    code will download malicious commands at runtime. This can be done via a stealthy
    update or user update. For example, the Plankton malware uses stealthy updates
    that directly download a JAR file from a remote server and do not need any user
    permission. In the case of user updates, the user has to allow the app to download
    the new version of the app.'

    recommended that you take a look at the `AndroidManifest.xml` file to find out
    the app permissions. This will be helpful for understanding where the app stores
    the data, what resources it is trying to access, and more. For example, a Flashlight

- en: The historical data of a financial instrument is data about all the past prices
    at which a financial instrument was brought or sold. An algorithmic trading strategy
    is always vpot_candlestickirtually executed on historical data to evaluate its
    past performance before it's deployed with real money. This process is called
    **backtesting**. Historical data is quintessential for backtesting (covered in
    detail in [Chapter 8](b415aed0-c473-48ba-8e52-5914c7f0de87.xhtml), *Backtesting
    Strategies*). Also, historical data is needed for computing technical indicators
    (covered in detail in [Chapter 5](16529fe4-d3ea-4017-a6f9-bad85a41d8a0.xhtml),
    *Computing and Plotting Technical Indicators*), which help in making buy-or-sell
    decisions in real-time. Candlestick patterns are widely used tools for stock analysis.
    Various types of candlestick patterns are commonly used by analysts. This chapter
    provides recipes that show you how to fetch historical data using broker APIs,
    how to fetch and compute multiple candlestick patterns – Japanese (**open-high-low-close**
    (**OHLC**)), Line Break, Renko, and Heikin-Ashi – and how to fetch historical
    data using a third-party tool.

    plotting candlestick pattern charts, and `PlotType`, an enum for various types
    of candlestick patterns. The next two steps introduce two types of candlesticks,
    or simply **candles** – a green candle and a red candle. As we mentioned earlier,
    each entry in historical data is a candle. These two steps selectively extract
    a green and red candle from the data. (Please note that the indices that are passed
    to `historical_data.iloc` will be different if you choose a different duration
    for `historical_data`, as in the *Fetching historical data using the broker API*
    recipe). A Japanese candle is green in color if its **close** price is above its
    **open** price. A green candle is also called a **bullish** candle as it is indicative
    that the price was bullish, meaning rising, during that duration. A Japanese candle
    is red in color if its **close** price is below its **open** price. A red candle
    is also called a **bearish** candle as it is indicative that the price was bearish,
    meaning falling, during that duration.

    pattern chart**. Note that the candle interval is 1 minute, meaning that the timestamps
    are equally spaced in intervals of 1 minute. *Steps 5* and *6* demonstrate similar
    1-minute candle interval candlestick pattern charts for the `NSE:INFY` and `NSE:ICICIBANK`
    instruments.

    Japanese candlesticks pattern with varying candle intervals. Brokers typically
    support candle intervals of 1 minute, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
    30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, and so on. A shorter candle interval hints at a localized
    price movement trend, while a larger candle interval indicates an overall price
    movement trend. Depending on the algorithmic trading strategy, you may need a
    shorter candle interval or a larger one. A candle interval of 1 minute is often
    the smallest available candle interval. This recipe demonstrates the historical
    data of a financial instrument for a duration of a day in various candle intervals.

- en: In *step 1*, you import `plot_candlestick_chart`, a quick utility function for
    plotting candlestick pattern charts, `PlotType`, an enum for various types of
    candlestick patterns, and the `Linebreak` function, which can convert historical
    data from the Japanese candlestick pattern in the Line Break candlestick pattern.
    In *step 2*, you use the `get_instrument()` method of `broker_connection` to fetch
    an instrument and assign it to a new attribute, `instrument`. This object is an
    instance of the `Instrument` class. The two parameters needed to call get_instrument()
    are the exchange (`'NSE'`) and the trading symbol (`'TATASTEEL'`). Next, you use
    the `get_historical_data()` method of the `broker_connection` object to fetch
    the historical data for the instrument for the duration of December 2019, with
    a candle interval of 1 minute. The time-series data returned is in the form of
    the Japanese candlestick pattern. The `Linebreak()` function converts this data
    into a Line Break candlestick pattern, another `pandas.DataFrame` object. You
    assign it to `historical_data_1minute_linebreak`. Observe that `historical_data_1minute_linebreak` has
    only `timestamp`, `open`, and `close` columns. Also, observe that the timestamps
    are not equidistant as the Line Break candles are based on price movement and
    not time. In *steps 3* and *4*, you selectively extract a green and a red candle
    from the data. (Please note, the indices passed to `historical_data.iloc` would
    be different if you choose a different duration for `historical_data` fetched
    in the first recipe of this chapter.) Observe that the candles have no shadows
    (lines extending on either side of the main candle body) as the candles only have `open` and
    `close` attributes. In *steps 5*, you plot the complete historical data held by
    `historical_data` using the `plot_candlestick_chart()` function.

    the Renko candlestick pattern, a candlestick pattern that focuses on price movement.
    This differs from the Japanese candlestick pattern, which focuses on time movement.
    Brokers typically do not provide historical data as the Renko candlestick pattern
    via APIs. Brokers usually provide historical data by using the Japanese candlestick
    pattern, which needs to be converted into the Renko candlestick pattern. A shorter
    candle interval hints at a localized price movement trend, while a larger candle

- en: In *step 1*, you import `plot_candlestick_chart`, a quick utility function for
    plotting candlestick pattern charts, `PlotType`, an enum for various types of
    candlestick patterns, and the `HeikinAshi` function, which can convert historical
    data from the Japanese candlestick pattern into data that's applicable to the
    Heikin-Ashi candlestick pattern. In *step 2*, you use the `get_instrument()` method
    of `broker_connection` to fetch an instrument and assign it to a new attribute,
    `instrument`. This object is an instance of the `Instrument` class. The two parameters
    needed to call `get_instrument()` are the exchange (`'NSE'`) and the trading symbol
    (`'TATASTEEL'`). Next, you use the `get_historical_data()` method of the `broker_connection`
    object to fetch the historical data for the duration of December 2019, with a
    candle interval of 1 minute. The time-series data returned is in the form of Japanese
    candlestick pattern. The `HeikinAshi()` function converts this data to Heikin-Ashi
    candlestick pattern, another `pandas.DataFrame` object. You assign it to `historical_data_1minute_heikinashi`.
    Observe that `historical_data_1minute_heikinashi` has `timestamp`, `close`, `open`,
    `high`, and `low` columns. Also, observe that the timestamps are equidistant as
    the Heikin-Ashi candles are based on the average values of the Japanese candles.
    In *steps 3* and *4*, you selectively extract a green and a red candle from the
    data. (Please note, this indices passed to `historical_data.iloc` would be different
    if you choose a different duration for `historical_data` fetched in the first
    recipe of this chapter.) Observe that the candles have shadows (lines extending
    on either side of the main candle body) as the candle have `high` and `low` attributes,
    along with the `open` and `close` attributes. In *step 5*, you plot the complete
    historical data held by `historical_data` using the `plot_candlstick_charts()`
    function.

    For example, to confirm trends, using a combination of data with a smaller candle
    interval, say 3 minutes, and data with a larger candle interval, say 15 minutes,
    would be desirable. On the other hand, to grab opportunities in intraday trading,
    data with larger candle intervals, say 1 hour or 1 day, would not be desirable.

    using `quandl.get()` and plotted using the `plot_candlestick_chart()` method.

    format.

- en: The upside of such third-party modules is that they are free and you don't need
    to set up a broker connection to fetch the historical data. The downside is that
    this data from the free package has its limitations. For example, the data cannot
    be fetched in real-time and the data cannot be fetched for intraday trading (1-minute
    candle, 3-minute candle, and so on).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, whether you want to use this data depends on your requirements. It may be
    good for testing or flow flushing the existing code base, but not good enough
    for providing live data feeds, which are needed during real trading sessions.

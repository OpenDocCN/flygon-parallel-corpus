    is added to the fray. The email plays a major role in most types of investigations.
    The email evidence extends to both business and personal devices, as it is widely
    used to send files, communicate with peers, and to receive notifications from
    online services. By examining email, we can learn what social media, cloud storage,
    or other sites are used by the custodian. We can also look for data exfiltration
    outside of an organization or investigate the source of a phishing scheme.

- en: The EML file format is widely used for storing email messages, as it is a structured
    text file that is compatible across multiple email clients. This text file stores
    email headers, body content, and attachment data as plain text, using `base64`
    to encode binary data and the **Quoted-Printable** (**QP**) encoding to store
    content information.

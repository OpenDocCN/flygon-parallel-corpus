    properties named `padx` and `pady`. These can be used to add space around many
    widgets, improving horizontal and vertical alignments, respectively. We hard-coded
    20 pixels of space to the left and right of the LabelFrame, and we added 40 pixels
    to the top and bottom of the frame. Now our LabelFrame stands out more than it

    the main loop displays them. So, instead of hard-coding values when we first create
    a widget, we can work on our layout and then arrange spacing towards the end of
    our file, just before the GUI is being created. This is a neat technique to know.

    By moving the column value of the LabelFrame from 0 to 1, we were able to get
    the controls back to where they used to be and where we prefer them to be. At
    least the left-most label, text, checkbox, scrolledtext, and radio button widgets
    are now located where we intended them to be. The second label and text `Entry`
    located in column 1 have aligned themselves to the center of the length of the
    **Labels in a Frame** widget, so we basically moved our alignment challenge one
    column to the right. It is not so visible because the size of the **Choose a number:**
    label is almost the same as the size of the **Labels in a Frame** title, and so

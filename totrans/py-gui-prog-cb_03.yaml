    have to pass in the parent of the widget we wish to have a tooltip displaying
    some extra information. For our ScrolledText widget we made the variable `scr`
    point to it so this is what we pass into the constructor of our ToolTip creation
    function.

    we show the simplest OOP example possible. As a default, every Python class we
    create inherits from the `object` base class. Python, being the pragmatic programming
    language that it truly is, simplifies the class creation process.

    and clicking on the new **Tab 3**. It really is orange and blue when you run the
    code. In this non-colored book, this might not be so visually obvious, but those
    colors are true; you can trust me on this.

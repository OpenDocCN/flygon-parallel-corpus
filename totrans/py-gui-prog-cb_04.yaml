    to program using OOP. Python is both OOP and procedural. We can create global
    variables that are localized to the module they reside in. They are global only
    to this module, which is one form of encapsulation. Why do we want this? Because,

    any syntax errors and pointing them out. You cannot run your Python code if you
    do not have the syntax right. This includes indentation (if not resulting in a

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We created a callback method in the `OOP` class, which gets called when we select
    a value from the Spinbox widget because we bound the method to the widget via
    the `command` argument (`command=self._spin`). We use a leading underscore to
    hint at the fact that this method should be respected like a private Java method.

    surrounding a keyword are expected to be restricted to the Python language, and
    we should not use them in our own Python code.

    to provide a hint that this name should be respected as a private helper.

    be the best idea in practice.

    We will slightly enhance it to pass in the control widget and the tooltip text
    we wish to display when we hover the mouse over the control.

    then import this module into our primary module.

    can be seen when hovering the mouse over several of our GUI widgets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Refactoring our common `ToolTip` class code out into its own module helps us
    to reuse this code from other modules. Instead of copy/paste/modify we use the
    DRY principle and our common code is located in only one place, so when we modify
    the code, all modules that import it will automatically get the latest version
    of our module.

- en: In the preceding screenshots, we can see several tooltip messages being displayed.
    The one for the main window might appear a little bit annoying, so it is better
    not to display a tooltip for the main window because we really wish to highlight
    the functionality of the individual widgets. The main window form has a title
    that explains its purpose; no need for a tooltip.

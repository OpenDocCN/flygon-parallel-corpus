    no longer use the tkinter GUI controls until we closed the one instance of the
    wxPython GUI. Let's improve on this now.

    controls are no longer disabled and we can create several instances of the wxPython
    GUI by clicking the button. We can also type into and select the other tkinter
    widgets.

- en: We first tried to run the entire wxPython GUI application in a thread, but this
    did not work as the wxPython main event loop expects to be the main thread of
    the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We found a workaround for this by only running the wxPython `app.MainLoop` in
    a thread, which tricks it into believing it is the main thread.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One side-effect of this approach is that we can no longer individually close
    all of the wxPython GUI instances. At least one of them only closes when we close
    the wxPython GUI which created the threads as daemons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am not quite sure why this is. Intuitively, one might expect to be able to
    close all daemon threads without having to wait for the main thread that created
    them to close first.
  prefs: []

    our main thread is still running.

    technologies that were designed to be the one-and-only GUI toolkit for an application.
    We found various simple ways to combine them.

    start the wxPython GUI in its own thread that runs within the tkinter process.

    solution and Python globals are really only global in the module they have been
    declared in.

    when we click the button in this GUI, it runs the wxPython GUI. Both are running
    at the same time as before, but this time, there is an extra level of communication
    between the two GUIs.

    sentence to its own `TextCtrl` widget and then writes another line to itself as
    well as to the tkinter GUI. You will have to scroll up to see the first sentence
    in the wxPython GUI.

    the procedural code that was written above it. Because of this, the class has
    access to the functions and can write to the shared queue.

    fashion, but previously standalone and not talking to each other. However, in
    this recipe, we connected them further by making one GUI launch another and, via
    a simple multiprocessing Python queue mechanism, we were able to make them communicate
    with each other, writing data from a shared queue into both GUIs.

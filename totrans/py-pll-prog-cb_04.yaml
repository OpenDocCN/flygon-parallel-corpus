- en: Before the 1990s, writing parallel applications for different architectures
    was a more difficult job than what it is today. Many libraries facilitated the
    process, but there was not a standard way to do it. At that time, most parallel
    applications were destined for scientific research environments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The model that was most commonly adopted by the various libraries was the message-passing
    model, in which the communication between the processes takes place through the
    exchange of messages and without the use of shared resources. For example, the
    master process can assign a job to the slaves simply by sending a message that
    describes the work to be done. A second, very simple, example here is a parallel
    application that performs a merge sort. The data is sorted locally to the processes
    and the results are passed to other processes that will deal with the merge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the libraries largely used the same model, albeit with minor differences
    from each other, the authors of the various libraries met in 1992 to define a
    standard interface for the exchange of messages, and, from here, MPI was born.
    This interface had to allow programmers to write portable parallel applications
    on most parallel architectures, using the same features and models they were already
    used to.

- en: An interesting feature that is provided by MPI regards virtual topologies. As
    already noted, all the communication functions (point-to-point or collective)
    refer to a group of processes. We have always used the `MPI_COMM_WORLD` group
    that includes all processes. It assigns a rank of *0* to *n-1* for each process
    that belongs to a communicator of the size *n*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, MPI allows us to assign a virtual topology to a communicator. It defines
    an assignment of labels to the different processes: by building a virtual topology,
    each node will communicate only with its virtual neighbor, improving performance
    because it reduces execution times.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if the rank was randomly assigned, then a message could be forced
    to pass to many other nodes before it reaches the destination. Beyond the question
    of performance, a virtual topology makes sure that the code is clearer and more
    readable.

- en: MPI provides two building topologies. The first construct creates Cartesian
    topologies, while the latter creates any kind of topologies. Specifically, in
    the second case, we must supply the adjacency matrix of the graph that you want
    to build. We will only deal with Cartesian topologies, through which it is possible
    to build several structures that are widely used, such as mesh, ring, and toroid.

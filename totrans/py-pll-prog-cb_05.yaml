    that is of fundamental importance together with the concept of event programming:
    the *asynchronous model*.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The execution model of asynchronous tasks can be implemented through a single
    main control flow, both in single-processor systems and in multiprocessor systems.
    In the concurrent asynchronous execution model, the executions of various tasks
    intersect along the timeline, and everything happens under the action of a single
    flow of control (single-threaded). Once started, the execution of tasks can be
    suspended and then resumed over time, alternating with the execution of other
    current tasks that are present.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The development of code for the asynchronous model is completely different from
    that for multithreaded programming. A substantial difference between the concurrent
    multithreaded parallel model and the single-threaded concurrent asynchronous model
    lies in the fact that, in the first case, the OS decides on the timeline if we
    suspend the activity of one thread and start another.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This remains outside the control of the coder, unlike the asynchronous model.
    The execution or termination of a task continues as long as it is explicitly required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important feature of this type of programming is that the code is not
    performed on multiple threads, as in the classic concurrent programming, but on
    a single thread. Thus, it is not at all true that two tasks are executed at the
    same time, but, according to this approach, they are performed at almost the same
    time.

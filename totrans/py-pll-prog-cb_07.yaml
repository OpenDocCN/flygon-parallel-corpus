    satisfying appropriate levels of service and optimizing the efficiency of resource

    all the resources that allow the provider to provide cloud computing services
    such as servers, storage systems, and virtual machines. The idea behind the creation
    of the backend is to entrust the management of the entire system to a single central
    server, which will, therefore, have to constantly monitor traffic and user requests,
    perform access control, and implement communication protocols.

    Hypervisor, also called the*Virtual Machine Manager*. This is a firmware that

    the customer from the burden of management and maintenance activities such as
    software updates and the application of security patches.

    For the user, there is a considerable reduction in management costs, and for the
    provider, they have more control over the traffic, thus allowing them to avoid
    any overloads. An example of SaaS is any web-based email service, such as **Gmail**,

    a lack of operational consistency. Therefore, companies that adopt this model

    of their servers, optimizing them for the specific roles they must play.

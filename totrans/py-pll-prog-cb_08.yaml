    has led to the adoption of new techniques in the use of computers. One of these
    techniques is called *heterogeneous computing*, which aims to cooperate with different
    (or heterogeneous) processors in such a way as to have advantages (in particular)
    in terms of temporal computational efficiency.

    CPU) is called the *h**ost*, while the coprocessors (for example, the GPUs) are
    called *d**evices*. The latter are generally physically separated from the host and
    manage their own memory space, which is also separated from the host's memory.

    on the GPU. Unfortunately, the computer is not smart enough to understand how

    that are sequentially assigned to the various multiprocessors, thus implementing*coarse-grained
    parallelism*. Inside the blocks, there is the fundamental computational unit,
    the thread, with a very *fine parallel granularity*. A thread can belong to only
    one block and is identified by a unique index for the whole kernel. For convenience,
    there is the possibility of using two-dimensional indexes for blocks and three-dimensional
    indexes for threads. The kernels are executed sequentially between them. Blocks
    and threads, on the other hand, are executed in parallel. The number of threads
    running (in parallel) depends on their organization in blocks and on their requests
    in terms of resources, with respect to the resources available in the device.

    advantage of the inherent parallelism of the SM, the threads of the same warp
    must execute the same instruction. If this condition does not occur, then we speak

    involves a host processor that manages one or more heterogeneous devices. In particular,

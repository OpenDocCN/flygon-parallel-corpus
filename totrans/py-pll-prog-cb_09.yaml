- en: This last chapter will introduce two important software engineering topics—debugging
    and testing—that are important steps in the software development process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first part of the chapter is focused on code debugging. A bug is a mistake
    in a program and can cause different problems that may be more or less serious
    depending on the situation. To encourage programmers to search for bugs, special
    software tools are used, called **debuggers***;* using these software tools, we
    have the ability to find errors or malfunctions within a program by taking advantage
    of specific debugging functions, an activity that exists precisely for identifying
    the portion of software affected by a bug.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the second part, the main topic is *software testing: *it is a process used
    to identify deficiencies of *correctness*, *completeness*, and *reliability* in
    a software product that is being developed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this context, we will, therefore, examine the three most important Python
    tools for debugging code in action. These are `winpdb-reborn`, which involves
    debugging with a visualization tool; `pdb`, the debugger from the Python standard
    library; and `rpdb`, where `r` stands for remote, meaning that it is code debugging
    from a remote machine*.*
  prefs: []

    and `nose`.'

    component of a program within an independent operation.

- en: The term *debugging* indicates the activity of identifying the portion of code
    in which one or more errors (bugs) are detected in software following its use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The error can be localized during the testing phase of the program; that is
    when it is still in the development phase and is not yet ready to be used by the
    end-user, or during the use of the program by the latter. After finding the error,
    the debugging phase ensues and identifies the software part in which the error
    lies, which is sometimes very complex.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nowadays, this activity is supported by specific applications and debuggers,
    which show the execution to the programmer using step-by-step software instructions,
    allowing the viewing and analysis of the inputs and outputs of the program itself at
    the same time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before these tools were available for the activity of identifying and correcting
    errors (and even now, in the absence of them), the simplest (but also least effective)
    techniques for code inspection were printing a file or printing the instructions
    on the screen that the program was executing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Debugging is one of the most important operations for the development of a program.
    It is often extremely difficult due to the complexity of the software that is
    being developed. It is even delicate due to the risk of introducing new errors
    or behaviors that are not in line with those desired in the attempt to correct
    those for which the activity was undertaken.

    and constitutes a story in itself, some general principles are always applicable.
    In particular, in the context of software applications, it is possible to recognize
    the following four *debugging phases*, summarized in the following diagram:'

    (see [https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDebuggingTools)

- en: As mentioned in the introduction of this chapter, software testing is a process
    used to identify deficiencies of correctness, completeness, and reliability in
    a software product that is being developed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this activity, we, therefore, want to ensure the quality of the product
    by searching search for defects, or a sequence of instructions and procedures
    that, when executed with particular input data and in particular operating environments,
    generate malfunctions. A malfunction is a behavior of the software that is not
    expected by the user; therefore, it is different from the specifications and from
    the implicit or explicit requirements defined for such applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The purpose of testing is, therefore, to detect defects through malfunctions,
    so as to minimize the probability of such malfunctions occurring in the normal
    use of the software product. Testing cannot establish that a product functions
    correctly under all possible conditions of execution, but it can highlight defects
    under specific conditions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, given the impossibility of testing all the input combinations and the
    possible software and hardware environments in which the application may be operating,
    the probability of malfunctions cannot be reduced to zero, but it must be reduced
    to a minimum in order to be acceptable to the user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A particular type of software testing is the unit test (which we will learn
    about in this chapter), the purpose of which is to isolate each part of a program
    and show its correctness and completeness in the implementation. It also promptly
    brings out any defects so that they can be corrected easily before integration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, the unit test lowers the costs—in terms of time and resources—of
    identifying and correcting defects, compared to achieving the same result by performing
    tests on the entire application.

    test requires at least two tests, one for the true condition and one for the false
    condition. It can be shown that, for each functional code line, three to five
    lines of code are required for a test. It is therefore unrealistic to test all
    possible input combinations of any non-trivial code without a dedicated test case
    generation tool.

    is required throughout the development process. It is essential to keep track
    not only of the tests that have been developed and performed but also of all the
    changes made to the functional code of the unit in question and all the other
    units. The use of a version control system is essential. If a later version of
    a unit fails a test that it previously passed, then a version control system allow
    you to highlight the code changes that have occurred in the meantime.

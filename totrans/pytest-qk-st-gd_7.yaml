    for producing high-quality software. Testing should be a part of every professional
    software developer's toolbox, yet at the same time, it is considered by many to
    be a boring and repetitive part of the job. But that does not have to be the case
    when you use pytest as your testing framework.

    pytest effectively in your day-to-day coding tasks right from the first chapter,
    focusing on making you productive as quickly as possible. Writing tests should

    I will also try to convince you that it is not something that you should have
    simply because it is the right thing to do. Automated testing is something that
    you will want to have because it will make your job much **easier and more enjoyable**.
    We will take a glimpse at Python''s standard `unittest` module, and introduce
    pytest and why it carries so much more punch while also being dead simple to get
    started with. Then, we will cover how to write tests, how to organize them into
    classes and directories, and how to use pytest''s command line effectively. From
    there, we will take a look at how to use marks to control skipping tests or expecting
    test failures, how to use custom marks to your advantage, and how to test multiple
    inputs using the same testing code parameterization to avoid copy/pasting code.
    This will help us to learn how to manage and reuse testing resources and environments
    using one of pytest''s most loved features: fixtures. After that, we will take
    a tour of some of the more popular and useful plugins from the vast plugin ecosystem
    that pytest has to offer. Finally, we will approach the somewhat more advanced
    topic of how to gradually convert `unittest` based test suites into the pytest
    style in order to take advantage of its many benefits in existing code bases.'

    new technologies and libraries. It is common to write short snippets, follow a
    tutorial, play in the REPL, or even use Jupyter ([http://jupyter.org/](http://jupyter.org/)).
    Often, this involves manually verifying the results of what is being studied by
    using print statements or plotting graphics. This is easy, natural, and a perfectly
    valid way of learning new things.

    Professional software is not simple; on the contrary, it is usually very complex.
    Depending on how well designed a system is, parts can be intertwined in strange
    ways, with the addition of new functionality potentially breaking another, apparently
    unrelated, part of the system. Fixing a bug might cause another bug to spring
    up somewhere else.

    been squashed for good? Just as important, how can you ensure that, by fixing
    or introducing a new feature, another part of the system will not be broken?

- en: The answer is by having a healthy and embracing suite of automated tests, also
    called a test suite.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A test suite is, simply put, code that tests your code. Usually, they create
    one or more necessary resources and call the application code under test. They
    then assert that the results are as expected. Besides being executed on the developer's
    machine, in most modern setups, they are run continuously—for example, every hour
    or every commit—by an automated system such as Jenkins. Because of this, adding
    tests for a piece of code means that, from now on, it will be tested again and
    again as features are added and bugs are fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Having automated tests means that you can make changes to a program and immediately
    see if those changes have broken part of the system, acting as a safety net for
    developers. Having a good test suite is very liberating: you no longer fear improving
    a piece of code that was written 8 years ago, and if you make any mistakes, the
    test suite will tell you. You can add a new feature and be confident that it will
    not break any other parts of the system that you did not expect. It is absolutely
    essential to be able to convert a large library from Python 2 to 3 with confidence,
    or make large-scale refactorings. By adding one or more automated tests that reproduce
    a bug, and prove that you fixed it, you ensure the bug won''t be reintroduced
    by refactoring or another coding error later down the road.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Once you get used to enjoying the benefits of having a test suite as a safety
    net, you might even decide to write tests for APIs that you depend on but know
    that developers don''t have tests for: it is a rare moment of professional pride
    to be able to produce failing tests to the original developers to prove that their
    new release is to blame for a bug and not your code.'

    tests by subclassing from `unittest.TestCase` and defining methods that begin
    with `test`. Here''s an example of a typical minimal test case using `unittest`:'

    to help you write your tests for the real world. Need a temporary directory? You
    need to create it yourself and clean up afterwards. Need to connect to a PostgreSQL
    database to test a Flask application? You will need to write the supporting code
    to connect to the database, create the required tables, and clean up when the
    tests end. Need to share utility test functions and resources between tests? You
    will need to create base classes and reuse them through subclassing, which in
    large code bases might evolve into multiple inheritance. Some frameworks provide
    their own `unittest` support code (for example, Django, [https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)),

    overlooked in tutorials or overviews of testing frameworks. Tests for real-world
    applications usually need complex setups, such as starting a background worker,
    filling up a database, or initializing a GUI. Using pytest, those complex test
    resources can be managed by a powerful mechanism called **fixtures**. Fixtures
    are simple to use but very powerful at the same time, and many people refer to
    them as *pytest's killer feature.* They will be shown in detail in [Chapter 4](bf8b3438-83e6-4ce5-9df4-4da086636ef7.xhtml),

    powerful **plugin** system. Plugins can change several aspects of the test run,
    from how tests are executed to providing new fixtures and capabilities to make
    it easy to test many types of applications and frameworks. There are plugins that
    execute tests in a random order each time to ensure tests are not changing global
    state that might affect other tests, plugins that repeat failing tests a number
    of times to weed out flaky behavior, plugins that show failures as they appear
    instead of only at the end of the run, and plugins that execute tests across many
    CPUs to speed up the suite. There are also plugins that are useful when testing
    Django, Flask, Twisted, and Qt applications, further plugins for the acceptance
    testing of web applications using Selenium. The number of external plugins is
    really staggering: at the time of writing, there are over 500 pytest plugins available
    to be installed and used right away ([http://plugincompat.herokuapp.com/](http://plugincompat.herokuapp.com/)).'

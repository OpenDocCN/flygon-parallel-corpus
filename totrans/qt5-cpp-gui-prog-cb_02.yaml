- en: Qt provides an easy way to animate widgets or any other objects that inherit
    the `QObject` class, through its powerful animation framework. The animation can
    be used either on its own or used together with the state machine framework, which
    allows different animations to be played based on the current active state of
    the widget. Qt's animation framework also supports grouped animation, which allows
    you to move more than one graphics item simultaneously, or move them in sequence
    one after the other.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the more common methods to animate a GUI element is through the property
    animation class provided by Qt, known as the `QPropertyAnimation` class. This
    class is part of the animation framework and it makes use of the timer system
    in Qt to change the properties of a GUI element over a given duration.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we are trying to accomplish here is to animate the button from one position
    to another, while at the same time we also enlarge the button size along the way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By including the `QPropertyAnimation` header in our source code in Step 2, we
    will be able to access the `QPropertyAnimation` class provided by Qt and make
    use of its functionalities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The code in Step 3 basically creates a new property animation and applies it
    to the push button we just created in Qt Designer. We specifically request the
    property animation class changes the `geometry` properties of the push button
    and sets its duration to 3,000 milliseconds (3 seconds).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Then, the start value of the animation is set to the initial geometry of the
    push button, because obviously we want it to start from where we initially place
    the button in Qt Designer. The end value is then set to what we want it to become;
    in this case we will move the button to a new position at x: `200`, y: `200` while
    changing its size to width: `100`, height: `50` along the way.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After that, `call animation->start()` to start the animation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Compile and run the project and now you should see the button start to move
    slowly across the main window while expanding in size a bit at a time, until it
    reaches its destination. You can change the animation duration and the target
    position and scale by altering the values in the preceding code. It's really that
    simple to animate a GUI element using Qt's property animation system!

    our GUI, including timer, timeline, animation framework, state machine framework,
    and graphics view framework:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Timer**: Qt provides us with repetitive and single-shot timers. When the
    timeout value is reached, an event callback function will be triggered through
    Qt''s signal-and-slot mechanism. You can make use of a timer to change the properties
    (color, position, scale, and so on) of your GUI element within a given interval,
    in order to create an animation.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Timeline**: Timeline calls a slot periodically to animate a GUI element.
    It is quite similar to a repetitive timer, but instead of doing the same thing
    all the time when the slot is triggered, timeline provides a value to the slot
    to indicate its current frame index, so that you can do different things (such
    as offset to a different space of the sprite sheet) based on the given value.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Animation framework**: The animation framework makes animating a GUI element
    easy by allowing its properties to be animated. The animations are controlled
    by using easing curves. Easing curves describe a function that controls what the
    speed of the animation should be, resulting in different acceleration and deceleration
    patterns. The types of easing curve supported by Qt include: linear, quadratic,
    cubic, quartic, sine, exponential, circular, and elastic.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**State machine framework**: Qt provides us with classes for creating and executing
    state graphs, which allow each GUI element to move from one state to another when
    triggered by signals. The state graph in the state machine framework is hierarchical,
    which means every state can also be nested inside of other states.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    engine for visualizing and interacting with a large number of custom-made 2D graphical
    items. You can use the graphics view framework to draw your GUI and have them
    animated in a totally manual way if you are an experienced programmer.'

    color to blue when pressed and change back to red when the mouse is released.
    That works great and we can further enhance it by giving it a little transition
    when switching color. This can be easily achieved by adding transitions to the
    `Rectangle` object.

    an animation group to play the animations in sequence or in parallel. You can
    also control the animations using easing curves and determine when to play these
    animations using state machines, just like what we have done in the previous section.

    scale a rectangle from a size of `5` to a size of `1` within 2,000 milliseconds
    (2 seconds).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We created a blue `Rectangle` object and added a scale animator to it. We set
    the initial value to `5` and the final value to `1`. Then, we set the animation
    duration to `2000` and set the running value to `true` so that it will be played
    when the program starts.

- en: Just like the animation types, animators can also be put into groups (that is,
    parallel animation groups or sequential animation groups). An animation group
    will also be treated as an animator by QtQuick and be run on the scene graph's
    rendering thread whenever possible.

- en: There is something called animator in QML, which is similar but different from
    the ordinary animation type. Animator types are a special type of animation that
    operate directly on Qt Quick's scene graph, rather than the QML objects and their
    properties like regular animation types do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The value of the QML property will be updated after the animation has finished.
    However, the property is not updated while the animation is running. The benefits
    of using the animator type is that the performance is slightly better because
    it doesn't run on the UI thread, but operates directly on the scene graph's rendering
    thread.

    resource.

    the running animation, which in this case was 11 frames. We also told Qt about
    the dimension of each frame of the animation, which in this case was 128 x 128\.
    After that, we set the frame rate to `25` to get a decent speed and then set it
    to loop infinitely. We then set the running value to `true` so that the animation
    will be played by default when the program starts running.

    clicking on the window. We simply check whether the sprite is current paused when
    clicking on the mouse area. If the sprite animation has been paused, then resume
    the animation; otherwise, pause the animation.

    animated sprite object is not anchored to the center of the window, which would
    have made it impossible to move around.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    `x` property. We set the start value to somewhere outside the window on the left
    side, and set the end value to somewhere outside the window on the right side.
    After that, we set the duration to 3,000 milliseconds (3 seconds) and made it
    loop infinitely.

    are used for character animation, particle animation, and even GUI animation.
    A sprite sheet consists of many images combined into one, which can then be chopped
    down and displayed on the screen one at a time. The transitions between different
    images (or sprites) from the sprite sheet creates the illusion of animation, which
    we usually refer to as sprite animation. Sprite animation can be easily achieved
    in QML using the `AnimatedSprite` type.

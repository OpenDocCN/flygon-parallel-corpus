- en: When I was approached by Al to write the foreword to this book, I was pretty
    excited about the prospect. A book on recursion! Now, that’s something you just
    don’t see every day. Considered by many to be one of the more mysterious topics
    in programming, recursion is often discouraged. Oddly, this stands in stark contrast
    to its storied use in weird job interview questions.

- en: However, there are all sorts of practical reasons to learn about recursion.
    Recursive thinking is very much a mindset about problem-solving. At its core,
    larger problems get broken into smaller problems. And sometimes along the way,
    hard problems are rewritten into equivalent but easier-to-solve simple problems.
    This sort of thinking can be a useful tool when applied to software design—even
    when recursion is not being used. Thus, it’s a worthy topic of study for programmers
    of all skill levels.

    this foreword in the form of a few short stories involving friends who’d applied
    recursive thinking in different ways but achieved a similar result. First there
    was the story of Ben, who learned about recursion, took it too far, and somehow
    managed to disappear off the face of the earth under mysterious circumstances
    after committing the following Python code into production:'

    that she was promptly fired! Oh, you wouldn’t believe how much all the fine editors
    at No Starch (bless their hearts) hated these stories. “You can’t start a book
    by telling people stories like that. It’s just going to scare everyone away!”
    To be fair, they probably have a point. In fact, they *even* made me move a more
    reassuring paragraph about recursion from later in this foreword up to the second
    paragraph just so you wouldn’t first read about the stories of Ben and Chelsea
    and run away in a screaming horror to read a book about design patterns instead.

- en: Clearly, writing the foreword to a book is serious business. So, regrettably,
    I’ll have to share the true stories of Ben and Chelsea with you another time.
    But, getting back to the book, it’s true that recursion is not a technique that
    gets applied to the vast majority of problems in day-to-day programming. As such,
    it often carries an aura of magic about it. This book hopes to dispel much of
    that. This is a good thing.

- en: Finally, as you set off on your recursion journey, be prepared to have your
    brain bent in new directions. Not to worry—this is normal! However, it’s also
    important to stress that recursion is supposed to be a bit of fun. Well, at least
    a little bit. So, enjoy the ride!

- en: When I was approached by Al to write the foreword to this book, I was pretty
    excited about the prospect. A book on recursion! Now, that’s something you just
    don’t see every day. Considered by many to be one of the more mysterious topics
    in programming, recursion is often discouraged. Oddly, this stands in stark contrast
    to its storied use in weird job interview questions.

  zh: 当Al找我写这本书的序言时，我对这个前景感到非常兴奋。一本关于递归的书！现在，这是你每天都看不到的东西。许多人认为递归是编程中更神秘的主题之一，通常是不鼓励的。奇怪的是，这与它在奇怪的面试问题中的使用形成了鲜明对比。
- en: However, there are all sorts of practical reasons to learn about recursion.
    Recursive thinking is very much a mindset about problem-solving. At its core,
    larger problems get broken into smaller problems. And sometimes along the way,
    hard problems are rewritten into equivalent but easier-to-solve simple problems.
    This sort of thinking can be a useful tool when applied to software design—even
    when recursion is not being used. Thus, it’s a worthy topic of study for programmers
    of all skill levels.

  zh: 然而，学习递归有各种实际原因。递归思维在解决问题方面非常重要。在其核心，更大的问题被分解成更小的问题。有时候，在这个过程中，难题被重写成等价但更容易解决的简单问题。这种思维方式在软件设计中可以成为一个有用的工具，即使没有使用递归。因此，对于各种技能水平的程序员来说，这是一个值得研究的课题。
- en: 'In my unbridled excitement to say more about recursion, I originally wrote
    this foreword in the form of a few short stories involving friends who’d applied
    recursive thinking in different ways but achieved a similar result. First there
    was the story of Ben, who learned about recursion, took it too far, and somehow
    managed to disappear off the face of the earth under mysterious circumstances
    after committing the following Python code into production:'

  zh: 在我对递归充满激动的情绪下，我最初以几个涉及朋友如何以不同方式应用递归思维但取得类似结果的短故事的形式写了这篇序言。首先是本的故事，他学习了递归，走得太远，然后在将以下Python代码投入生产后以神秘的方式消失在地球表面上。

- en: Then there was the story of Chelsea, who became so effective at real-world problem-solving
    that she was promptly fired! Oh, you wouldn’t believe how much all the fine editors
    at No Starch (bless their hearts) hated these stories. “You can’t start a book
    by telling people stories like that. It’s just going to scare everyone away!”
    To be fair, they probably have a point. In fact, they *even* made me move a more
    reassuring paragraph about recursion from later in this foreword up to the second
    paragraph just so you wouldn’t first read about the stories of Ben and Chelsea
    and run away in a screaming horror to read a book about design patterns instead.

  zh: 然后有切尔西的故事，她在解决现实世界问题方面变得如此有效，以至于她立刻被解雇了！哦，你不会相信无淀粉（祝福他们的心）所有优秀编辑是多么讨厌这些故事。“你不能通过讲这样的故事来开始一本书。这只会吓跑所有人！”公平地说，他们可能有点道理。事实上，他们甚至让我把这篇序言后面更令人放心的关于递归的段落移到第二段，这样你就不会首先读到本和切尔西的故事，然后惊恐地逃开去读一本关于设计模式的书。
- en: Clearly, writing the foreword to a book is serious business. So, regrettably,
    I’ll have to share the true stories of Ben and Chelsea with you another time.
    But, getting back to the book, it’s true that recursion is not a technique that
    gets applied to the vast majority of problems in day-to-day programming. As such,
    it often carries an aura of magic about it. This book hopes to dispel much of
    that. This is a good thing.

  zh: 显然，写一本书的序言是一件严肃的事情。所以，遗憾的是，我将不得不在另一个时间与你分享本和切尔西的真实故事。但是，回到这本书，递归确实不是日常编程中应用于绝大多数问题的技术。因此，它经常带有一种神奇的光环。这本书希望消除其中的大部分。这是一件好事。
- en: Finally, as you set off on your recursion journey, be prepared to have your
    brain bent in new directions. Not to worry—this is normal! However, it’s also
    important to stress that recursion is supposed to be a bit of fun. Well, at least
    a little bit. So, enjoy the ride!

  zh: 最后，当你开始你的递归之旅时，要做好大脑会被新方向弯曲的准备。不用担心，这很正常！然而，重要的是要强调递归应该是有点乐趣的。好吧，至少有一点点。所以，享受这段旅程吧！

    solve for you. You may have written a small/medium application with React, and
    you want to improve your skills and answer all of your open questions. You should
    know that React is maintained by the developers at Facebook and hundreds of contributors
    within the JavaScript community. React is one of the most popular libraries for
    creating UIs, and it is well known to be fast, thanks to its smart way of working
    with the **Document Object Model** (**DOM**). It comes with JSX, a new syntax
    for writing markup in JavaScript, which requires you to change your thinking regarding
    the separation of concerns. It has many cool features, such as server-side rendering,
    which gives you the power to write universal applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When reading the React documentation or blog posts about React, you will have
    undoubtedly come across the term  **declarative**. One of the reasons why React
    is so powerful is that it enforces a declarative programming paradigm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, to master React, it is essential to understand what declarative programming
    means and what the main differences between imperative and  declarative  programming
    are. The easiest way to approach this is to think about imperative programming
    as a way of describing how things work, and declarative programming as a way of
    describing what you want to achieve.

    no need to use variables, nor to keep their values updated during the execution.
    Declarative programming tends to avoid creating and mutating a state.

    and there's no need to list all the steps to make it work. The fact that React
    offers a declarative approach makes it easy to use, and consequently, the resulting
    code is simple, which often leads to fewer bugs and more maintainability.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but there is another object you should know about if you want to use React effectively
    – the element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever you call  `createClass`, extend  `Component`, or declare a stateless
    function, you are creating a component. React manages all the instances of your
    components at runtime, and there can be more than one instance of the same component
    in memory at a given point in time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned previously, React follows a  declarative  paradigm, and there's
    no need to tell it how to interact with the DOM; you declare what you want to
    see on the screen, and React does the job for you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As you might have already experienced, most other UI libraries work the other
    way round: they leave the responsibility of keeping the interface updated to the
    developer, who has to manage the creation and destruction of the DOM elements
    manually.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To control the UI flow, React uses a particular type of object, called an **element**,
    which describes what has to be shown on the screen. These immutable objects are
    much simpler  compared  to the components and their instances and contain only
    the information that is strictly needed to represent the interface.

  type: TYPE_PRE

    There is also a particular property, called  `children`, that is optional and  represents  the
    direct descendant of the element.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`type` is important because it tells React how to  deal  with the element itself.
    If `type`  is a string, the element represents a  DOM node, while if `type` is
    a function, the element is a  component.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: When the type of the element is a function, React calls the function, passing
    `props` to get back the underlying elements. It keeps on performing the same operation
    recursively on the result until it gets a tree of DOM nodes that React can render
    on the screen. This process is called **reconciliation**, and it is used by both
    React DOM and React Native to create the UIs of their respective platforms.

- en: In the last two decades, we learned that the separation of concerns is important,
    and we used to think about it as separating the logic from the templates. Our
    goal has always been to write the JavaScript and the HTML in different files.
    Various templating solutions have been created to help developers achieve this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem is that most of the time, that kind of separation is just an illusion
    and the truth is that the JavaScript and the HTML are tightly coupled, no matter
    where they live.

    templating systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first row tells Mustache to loop  through  a collection of items. Inside
    the loop, there is some conditional logic to check whether the  `#first`  and
    `#link`  properties exist and, depending on their values, a different piece of
    HTML is rendered. Variables are wrapped in curly braces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your application only has  to display some variables, a templating library
    could represent a good solution, but when it comes to starting to work with complex
    data structures, things change. Templating systems and their **Domain-Specific
    Language** (**DSL**) offer a subset of features, and they try to provide the functionalities
    of a real programming language without reaching the same level of completeness.
    As shown in the example, templates highly depend on the models they receive from
    the logic layer to display the information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, JavaScript interacts with the DOM elements rendered by the
    templates to update the UI, even if they are loaded from separate files. The same
    problem applies to styles – they are defined in a different file, but they are
    referenced in the templates, and the CSS selectors follow the structure of the
    markup, so it is almost impossible to change one without breaking the other, which
    is the definition of **coupling**. That is why the classic separation of concerns
    ended up being more the separation of technologies, which is, of course, not a
    bad thing, but it doesn't solve any real problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: React  tries to move a step forward by putting the  templates  where they belong
    – next to the logic. The reason it does that is  that React  suggests you organize
    your applications by composing small bricks called  components. The framework
    should not tell you how to separate the  concerns  because every application has
    its own, and only the developers should decide how to limit the boundaries of
    their applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The component-based approach drastically changes the way we write web applications,
    which is why the classic concept of separation of concerns is gradually being
    taken over by a much more modern structure. The paradigm enforced by React is
    not new, and it was not invented by its creators, but React has contributed to
    making the concept mainstream and, most importantly, popularized it in such a
    way that it is easier to understand for developers with different levels of expertise.

    we are not used to that kind of syntax. As soon as we learn it and we realize
    how powerful it is, we understand its potential. Using JavaScript for both logic
    and templating not only helps us separate our concerns in a better way, but it
    also gives us more power and more expressivity, which is what we need to build
    complex UIs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is why even if the idea of mixing JavaScript and HTML sounds weird in the
    beginning, it is vital to give React 5 minutes. The best way to get started with
    new technology is to try it on a small side project and see how it goes. In general,
    the right approach is always to be ready to unlearn everything and change your
    mindset if the long-term benefits are worth it.

    transpilers, module bundlers, and an  infinite  list of different libraries. This
    idea is so widespread and shared among people  that  it has been clearly defined,
    and has been given the name  **JavaScript fatigue***.*

    tens of dependencies to offer solutions for any problems. It is straightforward
    to think that all these tools are required to start using React, but this is far
    from the truth. Despite this common way of thinking, React is a pretty tiny library,
    and it can be used inside any page (or even inside JSFiddle) in the same way everyone
    used to use jQuery or Backbone, just by including the script on the page before
    the closing `body` element.

    standard language supported by the browser; but the whole point is to start with
    the bare minimum set of features and add more functionalities as soon as they
    are needed. For a simple UI, we could just use  `createElement` (`_jsx` on React
    17) and only when we start building something more complex can we include a transpiler
    to enable JSX and convert it into JavaScript. As soon as the app grows a bit more,
    we may need a router to handle different pages and views, and we can include that
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At some point, we may want to load data from some API endpoints, and if the
    application keeps growing, we will reach the point where we need some external
    dependencies to abstract complex operations. Only  at  that very moment should
    we introduce a package manager. Then, the time will come to split our application
    into separate modules and organize our files in the right way. At that point,
    we should start thinking about using a module bundler.

    that has 100 dependencies and tens of  `npm`  packages of which we know nothing
    is the best way to get lost. It is important to note that every programming-related
    job (and  frontend  engineering in particular) requires continuous learning. It
    is the nature of the web to evolve at a breakneck pace and change according to
    the needs of both users and developers. This is the way our environment has worked

    for following the rest of the book, and that are crucial to working with React
    daily. We now know how to write declarative code, and we have a clear understanding
    of the difference between the components we create and the elements that React
    uses to display their instances on the screen.

    and why that unpopular decision has been a big win for React. We went through
    the reasons why it is common to feel fatigued in the JavaScript ecosystem, but
    we have also seen how to avoid those problems by following an iterative approach.

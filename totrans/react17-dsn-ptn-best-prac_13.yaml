- en: The effective performance of a web application is critical to providing a good
    user experience and improving conversions. The React library implements different
    techniques to render our components fast and to touch the **Document Object Model**
    (**DOM**) as little as possible. Applying changes to the DOM is usually expensive,
    and so minimizing the number of operations is crucial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    process, and it's up to the developer to implement specific solutions to make
    the application run smoothly.

- en: In this chapter, we will go through the basic concepts of React and we will
    learn how to use some APIs to help the library find the optimal path to update
    the DOM without degrading the user experience. We will also see some common mistakes
    that can harm our applications and make them slower.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the time, React is fast enough by default, and you do not need to do
    anything more to improve the performance of your application. React utilizes different
    techniques to optimize the rendering of the components on the screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When React has to display a component, it calls its `render` method  and the
    `render` methods of its children recursively. The `render` method of a component
    returns a tree of React elements, which React uses to decide which DOM operations
    have to be done to update the UI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever the component state changes, React calls the `render` method on the
    nodes again, and it compares the result with the previous tree of React elements.
    The library is smart enough to figure out the minimum set of operations required
    to apply the expected changes on the screen. This process is called  **reconciliation,**  and
    it is managed transparently by React. Thanks to that, we can easily describe how
    our components have to look at a given point in time in a declarative way and
    let the library do the rest.
  prefs: []

- en: React tries to apply the smallest possible number of operations on the DOM because
    touching the DOM is an expensive operation.

    two assumptions to reduce its complexity:'

- en: By default, when coming back to the children of a DOM node, both lists of children
    are iterated by React at the same time, and whenever there is a difference, it
    creates a mutation.

    the subtrees line, `<li>Carlos</li>` and `<li>Javier</li>`, intact. This can possibly
    be an issue. This problem can, of course, be solved and the way for this is the
    `key` attribute that is supported by React. Let's look at that next.

    parts of the content. The key has to only be unique among its siblings; it does
    not have to be unique globally. An item index in the array can be passed as a
    key, but it is now considered a bad practice. However, if the items are never
    recorded, this can work well. The reorders will seriously affect performance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The new React Hooks, such as `React.memo`, use a shallow comparison method against
    the props, which means that if we pass an object as a prop and we mutate one of
    its values, we do not get the expected behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, a shallow comparison cannot find mutation on the properties and the
    components never get re-rendered, except when the object itself changes. One way
    to solve this issue is by using  **immutable data**, data that, once it gets created,
    cannot be mutated.

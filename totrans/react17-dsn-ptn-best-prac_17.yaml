    of the best cloud services I have tried, not just because of the affordable costs,
    but also because it is super easy and fast to configure, and the community has
    a lot of updated documentation to fix most of the common issues related to server
    configuration.

    show you the cheapest way to do this, and if in the future you want to increase
    the power of your Droplets, you will be able to increase the capacity without
    redoing the configuration. The lowest price for the very basic Droplet is $5.00
    per month ($0.007 per hour).

    you have acquired throughout this book. As opposed to previous chapters, not all

    the steps required to accomplish your desired goals. It is recommended to avoid
    referencing past chapters for guidance. Instead, try to use your memory, or the
    tools available in the system. This exercise, if performed correctly, will train
    you effectively for official exams.

    partner project—and the familiar JavaScript toolchain, namely `npm` and `webpack`
    (or another JavaScript module bundler).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's no longer a need for `babel`, since BuckleScript compiles to the ES5
    version of JavaScript. The compiled output can be configured to use either the
    CommonJS, AMD, or ES module formats. Reason's powerful static-type system replaces
    the need for Flow and ESlint. Additionally, Reason's editor plugins all come with
    `refmt`, which is essentially `prettier` for Reason.

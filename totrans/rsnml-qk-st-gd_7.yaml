    GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language and a runtime we can use to fulfill those
    queries and was also created by Facebook. With GraphQL, ReactJS components can
    include GraphQL fragments for data that a component requires—this means that a
    component can couple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and its external data all in one file.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using GraphQL, do I need to create JSON decoders?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since GraphQL knows your application's external data intimately, the GraphQL
    client (`reason-apollo`) will generate the decoders for you automatically. Of
    course, the decoders would have to be automatically generated so we're confident
    that they reflect the current shape of the external data. This is just another
    reason to consider using GraphQL with your Reason application when you need to
    handle external data.

- en: As long as we're working within Reason, the type system will prevent you from
    running into runtime type errors. However, when interacting with the outside world—whether
    it be JavaScript or external data—we lose those guarantees. To be able to preserve
    these guarantees within Reason's boundaries, we need to help out the type system
    when using things outside Reason. We previously learned how to use external JavaScript
    in Reason, and in this chapter we've learned how to use external data in Reason.
    Although writing decoders and encoders is more challenging, it's quite similar
    to writing JavaScript bindings. In the end, we're simply telling Reason the type
    of something external to Reason. With GraphQL, we can extend the boundaries of
    Reason to include external data. There are trade-offs, and nothing is perfect,
    but it's definitely worth giving GraphQL a shot.

- en: We extend you a very warm welcome to the first chapter of our journey. Let's
    give you an idea of what you will achieve here. After reading this chapter, you
    will have the basic and stimulating knowledge you need to set up a development
    environment to work with RESTful web services. Then, you will familiarize yourself
    with the development of a very basic project related to it. In addition, by the
    end, you will have a very clear idea of how to create applications using RESTful
    web services and how you can achieve this. This chapter will give you the information
    you need to work with web services of this kind in a very easy and comprehensive
    way.

    specified here are used around the world, but you are free to choose your tools.

    MAC OS X, or Linux; tools are available for every OS.

    Eclipse as our IDE, JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final as our application server, Maven to automatize
    the build process, and SoapUI as a tool to test the functionality of web services
    that we will create. In addition, we suggest that you should install the latest
    version of JDK, which is JDK 1.7.x. For help, we have obtained and included some
    links that you need to use to get the software to implement the first example.
    Each link gives you more information about each tool, which can be profitable
    as you learn something about each one if you don't know about them already.

    templates that have been previously created; they allow us to create all kinds
    of applications from Java desktop applications to multimodule projects, where
    the EAR can contain several artifacts such as JAR and WAR. Its main objective
    is to get users up and running as quickly as possible by providing a sample project
    that demonstrates many of the features of Maven. If you want to learn more about
    Maven, you can find more information by visiting [http://maven.apache.org/](http://maven.apache.org/).

    a number that represents its ID; this number is `557`, as shown in the following

    is annotated with `@Consumes` and uses the `application`/`xml` value; this means
    that the POST request will be performed with a string in XML format, containing
    the information of the person to be saved. On the other hand, to find a person
    from its ID, you must make an HTTP GET request. The URL must indicate the ID the
    same way as indicated by the `@Path` annotation on the method. The `@Produces`
    annotation indicates that we will get the response in XML format. Finally, notice
    that the parameter ID, as indicated in the `@Path` annotation, is used as an argument
    of the method using the `@PathParam` annotation.

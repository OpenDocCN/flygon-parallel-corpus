    feeding for content, mobile device service feeds, or cloud computing are all driven
    by modern technologies, such as RESTful web services. Everybody has been talking
    about how their stateless model allows applications to scale easily and how it emphasizes
    on clear decoupling between data provisioning and data consumption. Nowadays,
    architects have started introducing the concept of microservices, aiming to reduce
    the complexity in systems by splitting their core components into small independent
    pieces that simply do a single task. So, enterprise-grade software is about to
    become a composite of such microservices. This makes it easy to maintain, and
    allows better life cycle management when new parts need to be introduced. Unsurprisingly,
    most of the microservices are serviced by RESTful frameworks. This fact may leave
    the impression that REST was invented sometime in the last decade, but that is
    far from the truth. In fact, REST has been around since the last decade of the
    previous century!

    Transfer** (**REST**) and will explain how REST couples with the HTTP protocol.
    You will look into five key principles that have to be considered while turning
    any HTTP application into a RESTful service-enabled application. You will also
    look at the differences between describing RESTful and classic **Simple Object
    Access Protocol** (**SOAP**)-based web services. Finally, you will learn how to
    utilize already-existing infrastructure for your benefit.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Resource manipulation operations through HTTP requests should always be considered
    atomic. All modifications of a resource should be carried out within an HTTP request
    in an isolated manner. After the request execution, the resource is left in a
    final state; this implicitly means that partial resource updates are not supported.
    You should always send the complete state of the resource.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Back to our catalog example, updating the price field of a given item would
    mean making a PUT request with a complete document (JSON or XML) that contains
    the entire data, including the updated price field. Posting only the updated price
    is not stateless, as it implies that the application is aware that the resource
    has a price field, that is, it knows its state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another requirement for your RESTful application to be stateless is that once
    the service gets deployed on a production environment, it is likely that incoming
    requests are served by a load balancer, ensuring scalability and high availability.
    Once exposed via a load balancer, the idea of keeping your application state at
    server side gets compromised. This doesn't mean that you are not allowed to keep
    the state of your application. It just means that you should keep it in a RESTful
    way. For example, keep a part of the state within the URI, or use HTTP headers
    to provide additional state-related data
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The statelessness of your RESTful API isolates the caller against changes at
    the server side. Thus, the caller is not expected to communicate with the same
    server in consecutive requests. This allows easy application of changes within
    the server infrastructure, such as adding or removing nodes.

    spending more time on turning already-complex solutions into even more complex
    and sophisticated ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Take classical SOAP web services, for example. Their various WS-* specifications
    are so many, and sometimes so loosely defined, that in order to make different
    solutions from different vendors interoperable, a separate specification, WS-Basic
    Profile, has been introduced. It defines extra interoperability rules in order
    to ensure that all WS-* specifications in SOAP-based web services can work together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When it comes to transporting binary data with classical web services over HTTP,
    things get even more complex, as SOAP-based web services provide different ways
    of transporting binary data. Each way is defined in other sets of specifications,
    such as **SOAP with** **Attachment References** (**SwaRef**) and **Message Transmission**
    **Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).** All this complexity was caused mainly because
    the initial idea of the web service was to execute business logic remotely, not
    to transport large amounts of data.

    web application. The **World Wide Web** (**WWW**) is an enormous universe, containing
    huge amount of data and a lot of users, eager to get that data. The evolution
    of the WWW has brought the requirement that applications should scale easily as
    their load increases. Scaling applications that have a state is difficult to achieve,
    especially when zero or close-to-zero operational downtime is expected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's why staying stateless is crucial for any application that needs to scale.
    In the best-case scenario, scaling your application would require you to put another
    piece of hardware for a load balancer, or bring another instance in your cloud
    environment. There would be no need for the different nodes to sync between each
    other, as they should not care about the state at all. Scalability is all about
    serving all your clients in an acceptable amount of time. Its main idea is to
    keep your application running and to prevent **Denial of Service** (**DoS**) caused
    by a huge amount of incoming requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scalability should not be confused with the performance of an application. Performance
    is measured by the time needed for a single request to be processed, not by the
    total number of requests that the application can handle. The asynchronous non-blocking
    architecture and event-driven design of Node.js make it a logical choice for implementing

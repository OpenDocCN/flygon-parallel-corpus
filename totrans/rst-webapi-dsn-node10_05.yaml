    for data manipulation for the items in the catalog application. These functions
    made use of the `express.js` **request** object to parse the incoming data in
    the body and then to carry out the appropriate database operation. Each function
    populated the **response** object with a relevant status code and response body
    payload, if needed. Finally, we bound each function to a route, accepting HTTP
    requests.

- en: 'The catalog application handles two types of entities: items and categories.
    Each item entity contains a collection of categories where it belongs. As you
    can see, the category is just a logical entity in our application; it will exist
    as long as there is at least one item referencing it, and will cease to exist
    when no items refer it. This is why the application exposes routes for exposing
    data manipulation functions only for resources of type items, while the operations
    for categories are more or less read only. Looking more carefully into the URLs
    exposing the data manipulation operations for the items, we can see a clear pattern
    aligning the URL to the REST fundamental principles—a resource is exposed by a
    single URL, and it supports resource manipulation actions that are determined
    by the HTTP method of the request. To sum up, listed here are the generally accepted
    rules that a well-defined API should follow. They are semantically related to
    each resource manipulation operation:'

    code, followed by a location header that specifies the URL where the newly created
    resource can be accessed.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Operation that creates resources may be implemented to gracefully reject creation
    of resources, which unique identifiers already use; in such cases, the operation
    should indicate a non-successful invocation with an appropriate status code **409
    Conflict**, or a more general **400 BAD REQUEST**. However, a general status code
    should always be followed by a meaningful explanation of what has gone wrong.
    In our implementation, we choose a different approach—we update the resource from
    the create operation, if it exists, and notify the caller that the resource was
    updated by returning the **200 OK** status code instead of **201 Created**.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Update** operation resembles the create operation; however, it always
    expects a resource identifier as a parameter, if a resource with this identifier
    exists—it gets updated with a new state provided in the body of the HTTP PUT request.
    The **200 OK** status code indicates successful invocation. The implementation
    may decide to reject handling of non-existent resources with the **404 Not Found** status
    code or creating a new resource with the passed identifier. In that case, it would
    return the **201 Created** status code, followed by a location header that specifies
    the URL where the newly created resource can be accessed. Our API makes use of
    the second option.

    successful deletion with the **200 OK** status code, followed by a JSON payload:`{''Status'':
    ''Successfully deleted''}`. Status code **404 Not found** will indicate that a
    resource with the provided identifier does not exist.'

- en: It is best practice that `update` and `create` operations should return as a
    payload to the entire state of the resource. For instance, if a resource is created
    with a minimum set of attributes, all non specified attribute will get default
    values; the response body should contain the full state of the object. The same
    is valid for updates; even if an update operation updates the resource restate
    partially, the response should return the complete state. This may save the user-agent
    an additional GET request if they needed to check the new state.

    extensions that we can add in Version 2\. Currently, the catalog service supports
    listing of all items in a category and fetching an item by its ID. It's about
    time to take full advantage of MongoDB, being a document-oriented database, and
    implement a function that will enable our API consumer to query for items based
    on any of their attributes. For instance, list all items for a specific category
    with an attribute that matches a query parameter, such as price or color, or search
    by item name. RESTful services usually expose document-oriented data. However,
    their usage is not limited to documents only. In the next chapter, we will extend
    the catalog in a way that it also stores binary data—an image that can be linked
    to each item. For that purpose, we will use a MongoDB binary format called **Binary
    JSON** (**BSON**) in the *Working with arbitrary data* section in [Chapter 6](41896ef3-f01c-44e6-a22c-cfec877dc2ad.xhtml),

    code. However, this filtering parameter of `find()` is just a JSON object where

    the built-in `Object.keys` function to check whether the parsed key/value list

- en: The topic of discovering RESTful services has a long and complicated history.
    The HTTP specification states that a resource should be self-descriptive and that
    it should be identified uniquely by a URI. Dependent resources should be linked
    by the dependency using their own unique URIs. Discovering a RESTful service means
    navigating from one service to another, following the links it provides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the year 2009, a specification called **Web Application Discovery Language**
    (**WADL**) was invented. It aims to document every URI exposed from a web application,
    along with the HTTP methods it supports and the parameter it expects. The response
    media type of the URI is also described. This is very useful for documenting purposes,
    and it's all that a WADL file can provide us in terms of RESTful service provisioning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a WADL file for a given express route. We will have to manually create a WADL

    the URI of each resource, providing information about the media types it uses
    and the status codes that are expected at that URI. Many third-party RESTful clients
    understand the WADL language and can generate request messages out of a given

    on the right menu. That's not all; apart from the WADL standard, currently the
    swagger documentation format is heavily adopted and has become an informal standard
    for describing RESTful services, so we can also use it to ease the adoption and
    discovery of our service. In the next chapter, we will bind these description
    files to our service. This is an important step in the phase of production preparation.

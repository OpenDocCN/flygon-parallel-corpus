    the two versions exposed by different URLs, ensuring backward compatibility. We
    implemented unit tests for its database layer and discussed how to use HTTP status
    codes appropriately. In this chapter, we will extend that implementation—by providing
    handling of non-document—binary data to the second version of the service and
    linking it accordingly to the documents it relates to.

- en: MongoDB utilizes BSON (Binary JSON) as the primary data format. It is a binary
    format that stores key/value pairs in a single entity called **document.** For
    example, a sample JSON, `{"hello":"world"}`, becomes `\x16\x00\x00\x00\x02hello\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00\x00`
    when encoded in BSON.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BSON stores data rather than literals. For instance, if an image is to be part
    of the document, it will not have to be converted to a base64-encoded string;
    instead, it will be directly stored as binary data, unlike plain JSON, which will
    usually represent such data as base64-encoded bytes, but that is obviously not
    the most efficient way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mongoose schemas enable storing binary content in the BSON format via the schema
    type—**buffer**. It stores binary content (image, ZIP archive, and so on) up to
    16 MB. The reason behind the relatively small storage capacity is to prevent excessive
    usage of memory and bandwidth during transmission.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **GridFS** specification addresses this limitation of BSON and enables you
    to work with data larger than 16 MB. GridFS divides data into chunks stored as
    separate document entries. Each chunk, by default, has a size of up to 255 KB.
    When data is requested from the data store, the GridFS driver retrieves all the
    required chunks and returns them in an assembled order, as if they had never been
    divided. Not only does this mechanism allow storage of data larger than 16 MB,
    it also enables consumers to retrieve data in portions so that it doesn't have
    to be loaded completely into the memory. Thus, the specification implicitly enables
    streaming support.

    data, for example, its format, a filename, size, and so on. The metadata is stored

    usable Node.js module called `gridfs-stream`. It enables easy streaming of data
    in and out of MongoDB, as on all other modules it is installed as an `npm` package.
    So, let''s install it globally and see how it is used; we will also use the `-s`

    this way, it will be safely stored in MongoDB. Once stored, the `close`event associated

    that caching was a rather sensitive topic. In the end, our consumers will expect
    up-to-date results when executing a query. However, from a statistical point of
    view, data exposed in the web is more likely to be read rather than updated or
    deleted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, it is reasonable that some resources exposed by a public URL become a subject
    of millions of requests, considering taking off part of the load from the server
    to a cache. The HTTP protocol allows us to cache some responses for a given period
    of time. For instance, when multiple requests are received in a short period of
    time, querying for all items in the catalog of a given group, such as `/catalog/v2`,
    our service can utilize special HTTP headers that would force the HTTP server
    to cache the response for a defined time period. This would prevent redundant
    requests to the underlying database server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Caching at the HTTP server level is achieved via special response headers. The
    HTTP server uses a `Cache-Control` header to specify how long a given response
    should be cached for. The period before the cache needs invalidation is set via
    its `max-age` attribute, and its value is provided in seconds. Of course, there
    is a nice Node.js module that provides a middleware function for caching, called

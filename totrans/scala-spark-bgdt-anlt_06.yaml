- en: Apache Spark is a fast in-memory data processing engine with elegant and expressive
    development APIs to allow data workers to efficiently execute streaming machine
    learning or SQL workloads that require fast interactive access to datasets. Apache
    Spark consists of Spark core and a set of libraries. The core is the distributed
    execution engine and the Java, Scala, and Python APIs offer a platform for distributed
    application development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additional libraries built on top of the core allow the workloads for streaming,
    SQL, Graph processing, and machine learning. SparkML, for instance, is designed
    for Data science and its abstraction makes Data science easier.

- en: In order to plan and carry out the distributed computations, Spark uses the
    concept of a job, which is executed across the worker nodes using Stages and Tasks.
    Spark consists of a driver, which orchestrates the execution across a cluster
    of worker nodes. The driver is also responsible for tracking all the worker nodes
    as well as the work currently being performed by each of the worker nodes.

    using the `SparkContext`, and then the **executors** will execute the instructions.
    Once the execution is completed, the **Driver** program completes the job. You
    can, at this point, issue more commands and execute more Jobs.

    Apache Spark architecture, unlike the Hadoop framework where every `MapReduce`
    job or Hive query or Pig Script starts entire processing from scratch for each
    task we want to execute that too using expensive disk instead of memory.

    The **Driver** process creates a DAG of tasks for a piece of code you try to run
    using the distributed processing framework. Then, the DAG is actually executed
    in stages and tasks by the task scheduler by communicating with the **Cluster
    Manager** for resources to run the executors. A DAG represents a job, and a job
    is split into subsets, also called stages, and each stage is executed as tasks
    using one core per task.

    of operations. Usually, any transformation comes into the same stage as the one
    before, but every operation such as reduce or shuffle always creates a new stage
    of execution. Tasks are part of a stage and are directly related to the cores
    executing the operations on the executors.

    of objects. Spark RDDs are resilient or fault tolerant, which enables Spark to
    recover the RDD in the face of failures. Immutability makes the RDDs read-only
    once created. Transformations allow operations on the RDD to create a new RDD
    but the original RDD is never modified once created. This makes RDDs immune to
    race conditions and other synchronization problems.
  prefs: []

    to reach the actual data when it is required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    cluster. The number of partitions is independent of the number of nodes in the
    cluster. It could very well happen that a single node in the cluster has several
    partitions of data. The number of partitions of data that exist is entirely dependent
    on how many nodes your cluster has and the size of the data. If you look at the
    execution of tasks on the nodes, then a task running on an executor on the worker
    node could be processing the data which is available on the same local node or
    a remote node. This is called the locality of the data, and the executing task
    chooses the most local data possible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A second method for creating an RDD is by reading data from an external distributed
    source such as Amazon S3, Cassandra, HDFS, and so on. For example, if you are
    creating an RDD from HDFS, then the distributed blocks in HDFS are all read by
    the individual nodes in the Spark cluster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each of the nodes in the Spark cluster is essentially doing its own input-output
    operations and each node is independently reading one or more blocks from the
    HDFS blocks. In general, Spark makes the best effort to put as much RDD as possible
    into memory. There is the capability to `cache` the data to reduce the input-output
    operations by enabling nodes in the spark cluster to avoid repeated reading operations,
    say from the HDFS blocks, which might be remote to the Spark cluster. There are
    a whole bunch of caching strategies that can be used within your Spark program,
    which we will examine later in a section for caching.

    Context and the `textFile()` function. The `textFile` function loads the input
    data as a text file (each newline `\n` terminated portion becomes an element in
    the RDD). The function call also automatically uses HadoopRDD (shown in next chapter)
    to detect and load the data in the form of several partitions as needed, distributed
    across the cluster.

    element, filtering out elements, and performing calculations of some sort. Several
    transformations can be performed in a sequence; however no execution takes place
    during the planning.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For transformations, Spark adds them to a DAG of computation and, only when
    driver requests some data, does this DAG actually gets executed. This is called
    *lazy* evaluation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reasoning behind the lazy evaluation is that Spark can look at all the transformations
    and plan the execution, making use of the understanding the Driver has of all
    the operations. For instance, if a filter transformation is applied immediately
    after some other transformation, Spark will optimize the execution so that each
    Executor performs the transformations on each partition of data efficiently. Now,
    this is possible only when Spark is waiting until something needs to be executed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Actions** are operations, which actually trigger the computations. Until
    an action operation is encountered, the execution plan within the spark program
    is created in the form of a DAG and does nothing. Clearly, there could be several
    transformations of all sorts within the execution plan, but nothing happens until
    you perform an action.'

    triggers the execution of the transformation all the way up to the base RDD. If
    there is another action performed, then there is a new chain of executions that
    could take place. This is a clear case of why any caching that could be done at
    different stages in the directed acyclic graph will greatly speed up the next
    execution of the program. Another way that the execution is optimized is through
    the reuse of the shuffle files from the previous execution.

    branch of computer science that provides the computers the ability to learn without

    a way that it becomes automatic so that no human interactions are needed anymore,

    the datasets. That skewness is sometimes immense though. In step 4, the experimental
    dataset is randomly split, often into a training set and a test set, which is
    called sampling. The training dataset is used to train the model, whereas the
    test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the best model at the very
    end. The better practice is to use the training dataset as much as you can to
    increase generalization performance. On the other hand, it is recommended to use
    the test dataset only once, to avoid the overfitting problem while computing the

    vector) explanatory variables (also, independent variables, input variables, features,

- en: Binary classifiers are used to separate the elements of a given dataset into
    one of two possible groups (for example, fraud or not fraud) and are a special
    case of multiclass classification. Most binary classification metrics can be generalized
    to multiclass classification metrics. A multiclass classification describes a
    classification problem, where there are *M>2* possible labels for each data point
    (the case where *M=2* is the binary classification problem).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For multiclass metrics, the notion of positives and negatives is slightly different.
    Predictions and labels can still be positive or negative, but they must be considered
    in the context of a particular class. Each label and prediction takes on the value
    of one of the multiple classes and so they are said to be positive for their particular
    class and negative for all other classes. So, a true positive occurs whenever
    the prediction and the label match, while a true negative occurs when neither
    the prediction nor the label takes on the value of a given class. By this convention,
    there can be multiple true negatives for a given data sample. The extension of
    false negatives and false positives from the former definitions of positive and
    negative labels is straightforward.

    A fundamental point when considering classifier evaluation is that pure accuracy
    (that is, was the prediction correct or incorrect) is not generally a good metric.
    The reason for this is that a dataset may be highly unbalanced. For example, if
    a model is designed to predict fraud from a dataset where 95% of the data points
    are not fraud and 5% of the data points are fraud. Then suppose a naive classifier
    predicts not fraud (regardless of input) will be 95% accurate. For this reason,
    metrics such as precision and recall are typically used because they take into
    account the type of error. In most applications, there is some desired balance
    between precision and recall, which can be captured by combining the two into
    a single metric, called the **F-measure**.

- en: Random forests (also sometimes called random decision forests) are ensembles
    of decision trees. Random forests are one of the most successful machine learning
    models for classification and regression. They combine many decision trees in
    order to reduce the risk of overfitting. Like decision trees, random forests handle
    categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, do not
    require feature scaling, and are able to capture nonlinearities and feature interactions.
    There are numerous advantageous RFs. They can overcome the overfitting problem
    across their training dataset by combining many decision trees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A forest in the RF or RDF usually consists of hundreds of thousands of trees.
    These trees are actually trained on different parts of the same training set.
    More technically, an individual tree that has grown very deep tends to learn from
    highly unpredictable patterns. This kind of nature of the trees creates overfitting
    problems on the training sets. Moreover, low biases make the classifier a low
    performer even if your dataset quality is good in terms of features presented.
    On the other hand, an RF helps to average multiple decision trees together with
    the goal of reducing the variance to ensure consistency by computing proximities
    between pairs of cases.

    the results. But, eventually, the performance of the final model is increased

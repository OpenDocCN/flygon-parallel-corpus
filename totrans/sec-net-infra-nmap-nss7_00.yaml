    to design security mechanisms for their network infrastructures. Analyzing vulnerabilities
    is one of the best ways to secure your network infrastructure. This learning path
    begins by introducing you to the various concepts of network security assessment,
    workflows, and architectures. You will use open source tools to perform both active
    and passive network scanning and use these results to analyze and design a threat
    model for network security. With a firm understanding of the basics, you will
    learn to scan your network for vulnerabilities and open ports and use them as
    back doors into a network with the top tools of network scanning: Nessus and Nmap.
    As you progress through the chapters, you will learn how to carry out various
    key scanning tasks, such as firewall detection, OS detection, and access management
    to detect vulnerabilities in your network. By the end of this learning path, you
    will be familiar with the tools for network scanning and the techniques for vulnerability
    scanning and network protection.'

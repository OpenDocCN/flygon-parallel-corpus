- en: Spark comes bundled with a REPL shell, which is a wrapper around the Scala shell.
    Though the Spark shell looks like a command line for simple things, in reality
    a lot of complex queries can also be executed using it. This chapter explores
    different development environments in which Spark applications can be developed.

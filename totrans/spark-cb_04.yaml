- en: Spark can process data from various data sources such as HDFS, Cassandra, HBase,
    and relational databases, including HDFS. Big data frameworks (unlike relational
    database systems) do not enforce schema while writing. HDFS is a perfect example
    where any arbitrary file is welcome during the write phase. Reading data is a
    different story, however. You need to give some structure to even completely unstructured
    data to make sense out of it. With this structured data, SQL comes very handy
    when it comes to analysis.

    1.0 for the first time. It incorporates a project named Shark, which was an attempt

    could not optimize it any further. Finally, they decided to write the SQL Engine
    from scratch and that gave birth to Spark SQL.

- en: Spark SQL took care of all the performance challenges, but it had to provide
    compatibility with Hive and for that reason, a new wrapper context, `HiveContext`,
    was created on top of `SQLContext`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spark SQL supports accessing data using standard SQL queries and HiveQL, a SQL-like
    query language that Hive uses. In this chapter, we will explore different features
    of Spark SQL. It supports a subset of HiveQL as well as a subset of SQL 92\. It
    runs SQL/HiveQL queries alongside, or replacing the existing Hive deployments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Running SQL is only a part of the reason for the creation of Spark SQL. One
    big reason is that it helps to create and run Spark programs faster. It lets developers
    write less code, program read less data, and let the catalyst optimizer do all
    the heavy lifting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spark SQL uses a programming abstraction called **DataFrame**. It is a distributed
    collection of data organized in named columns. DataFrame is equivalent to a database
    table, but provides much finer level of optimization. The DataFrame API also ensures
    that Spark's performance is consistent across different language bindings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's contrast DataFrames with RDDs. An RDD is an opaque collection of objects
    with no idea about the format of the underlying data. In contrast, DataFrames
    have schema associated with them. You can also look at DataFrames as RDDs with
    schema added to them. In fact, until Spark 1.2, there was an artifact called **SchemaRDD**,
    which has now evolved into DataFrame. They provide much richer functionality than
    SchemaRDDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This extra information about schema makes possible to do a lot of optimizations,
    which were not otherwise possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DataFrames also transparently load from various data sources, such as Hive tables,
    Parquet files, JSON files, and external databases using JDBC. DataFrames can be
    viewed as RDDs of row objects, allowing users to call the procedural Spark APIs
    such as map.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DataFrame API is available in Scala, Java, Python, and also R starting Spark
    1.4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Users can perform relational operations on DataFrames using a **domain-specific
    language** (**DSL**). DataFrames support all the common relational operators and
    they all take expression objects in a limited DSL that lets Spark capture the
    structure of the expression.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will start with the entry point into Spark SQL, that is, SQLContext. We will
    also cover HiveContext that is a wrapper around SQLContext to support Hive functionality.
    Please note that HiveContext is more battle-tested and provides a richer functionality,
    so it is strongly recommended to use it even if you do not plan to connect to
    Hive. Slowly, SQLContext will come to the same level of functionality as HiveContext
    is.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two ways to associate schema with RDDs to create DataFrames. The easy
    way is to leverage Scala case classes, which we are going to cover first. Spark
    uses Java reflection to deduce schema from case classes. There is also a way to
    programmatically specify schema for advanced needs, which we will cover next.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would like to draw special attention to predicate the pushdown rule here.
    The concept is simple; if you issue a query in one place to run against the massive
    data, which is another place, it can lead to a lot of unnecessary data moving
    across the network.
  prefs: []

    access to `hive-site.xml`; otherwise, it will create its own Hive metastore and
    will not connect to your existing Hive warehouse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, all the tables created by Spark SQL are Hive-managed tables, that
    is, Hive has complete control on life cycle of a table, including deleting it
    if table metadata is dropped using the `drop table` command. This holds true only
    for persistent tables. Spark SQL also has mechanism to create temporary tables
    out of DataFrames for ease of writing queries, and they are not managed by Hive.

    implementation of the constructor, getters (accessors), equals and hashCode, and
    implement `Serializable`. Case classes work really well to encapsulate data as
    objects. Readers, familiar with Java, can relate it to **plain old Java objects**

    that the case classes cannot take more than 22 fields. Another case can be that
    you do not know about schema beforehand. In this approach, the data is loaded
    as an RDD of the `Row` objects. Schema is created separately using the `StructType`
    and `StructField` objects, which represent a table and a field respectively. Schema
    is applied to the `Row` RDD to create a DataFrame.

- en: Apache Parquet is a columnar data storage format, specifically designed for
    big data storage and processing. Parquet is based on record shredding and assembly
    algorithm in the Google Dremel paper. In Parquet, data in a single column is stored
    contiguously.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The columnar format gives Parquet some unique benefits. For example, if you
    have a table with 100 columns and you mostly access 10 columns, in a row-based
    format you will have to load all 100 columns, as granularity level is at row level.
    But, in Parquet, you will only load 10 columns. Another benefit is that since
    all the data in a given column is of the same datatype (by definition), compression
    is much more efficient.

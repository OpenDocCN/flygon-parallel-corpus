    uses them to recommend books, Netflix for movies, and Google News to recommend
    news stories. As the proof is in the pudding, here are some examples of the impact
    recommendations can have (source: Celma, Lamere, 2008):'

- en: As we have seen in the previous chapters, features and feature selection play
    a major role in the efficacy of machine learning algorithms. Recommender engine
    algorithms discover these features, called **latent features**, automatically.
    In short, there are latent features responsible for a user to like one movie and
    dislike another. If another user has corresponding latent features, there is a
    good chance that this person will also have a similar taste for movies.

    is not primarily a romance, so it may have 0.1 rating for romance, but 0.98 rating
    for action. Therefore, each movie can be represented as a feature vector.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Collaborative filtering is the most commonly used technique for recommender
    systems. It has an interesting property—it learns the features on its own. So,
    in the case of movie ratings, we do not need to provide actual human feedback
    on whether the movie is romantic or action.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we saw in the *Introduction* section that movies have some latent features,
    such as genre, in the same way users have some latent features, such as age, gender,
    and more. Collaborative filtering does not need them, and figures out latent features
    on its own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We are going to use an algorithm called **Alternating Least Squares** (**ALS**)
    in this example. This algorithm explains the association between a movie and a
    user based on a small number of latent features. It uses three training parameters:
    rank, number of iterations, and lambda (explained later in the chapter). The best
    way to figure out the optimum values of these three parameters is to try different
    values and see which value has the smallest amount of **Root Mean Square Error**
    (**RMSE**). This error is like a standard deviation, but it is based on model
    results rather than actual data.'

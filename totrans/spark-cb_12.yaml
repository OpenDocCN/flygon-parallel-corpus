- en: To understand memory optimization, it is a good idea to understand how memory
    management works in Java. Objects reside in Heap in Java. Heap is created when
    JVM starts, and it can resize itself when needed (based on minimum and maximum
    size, that is, `-Xms` and `-Xmx`, respectively assigned in configuration).
  id: totrans-70
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Heap is divided into two spaces or generations: young space and old space.
    The young space is reserved for the allocation of new objects. Young space consists
    of an area called **Eden** and two smaller survivor spaces. When the nursery becomes
    full, garbage is collected by running a special process called **young collection**,
    where all the objects, which have lived long enough, are promoted to old space.
    When the old space becomes full, the garbage is collected there by running a process
    called **old collection**.'

- en: The logic behind nursery is that most objects have a very short life span. A
    young collection is designed to be fast at finding newly allocated objects and
    moving them to the old space.
  id: totrans-73
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The JVM uses mark and sweep algorithm for garbage collection. Mark and sweep
    collection consists of two phases.
  id: totrans-74
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During the mark phase, all the objects, which have live references, are marked
    alive, the rest are presumed candidates for garbage collection. During the sweep
    phase, the space occupied by garbage collectable candidates is added to the free
    list, that is, they are available to be allocated to new objects.
  id: totrans-75
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two improvements to mark and sweep. One is **concurrent mark and sweep**
    (**CMS**) and the other is parallel mark and sweep. CMS focuses on lower latency,
    while the latter focuses on higher throughput. Both strategies have performance
    trade-offs. CMS does not do compaction, while parallel **garbage collector** (**GC**)
    performs whole-heap only compaction, which results in pause times. As a thumb
    rule, for real-time streaming, CMS should be used, and parallel GC otherwise.
  id: totrans-76
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you would like to have both low latency and high throughput, Java 1.7 update
    4 onwards has another option called **garbage-first GC** (**G1**). G1 is a server-style
    garbage collector, primarily meant for multicore machines with large memories.
    It is planned as a long-term replacement for CMS. So, to modify our thumb rule,
    if you are using Java 7 onwards, simply use G1.
  id: totrans-77
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: G1 partitions the heap into a set of equal-sized regions, where each set is
    a contiguous range of virtual memory. Each region is assigned a role like Eden,
    Survivor, and Old. G1 performs a concurrent global marking phase to determine
    the live references of objects throughout the heap. After the mark phase is over,
    G1 knows which regions are mostly empty. It collects in these regions first and
    this frees the larger amount of memory.

- en: The regions selected by G1 as candidates for garbage collection are garbage
    collected using evacuation. G1 copies objects from one or more regions of the
    heap to a single region on the heap, and it both compacts and frees up memory.
    This evacuation is performed in parallel on multiple cores to reduce pause times
    and increase throughput. So, each garbage collection round reduces fragmentation
    while working within user-defined pause times.

  id: totrans-90
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can happen at block level as well as node level.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    JVM needs to go over all the objects to find the ones it needs to garbage collect.

- en: Another trend that has put more load on CPU performance is the new compressed
    data formats such as Parquet. Both compression and serialization, as we have seen
    in the previous recipes in this chapter, lead to more CPU cycles. This trend has
    also pushed the need for CPU optimization to reduce the CPU cycle cost.

    management. GC has done an amazing job at taking away the memory management from
    the programmer and making it transparent. To do this, Java has to put a lot of
    overhead, and that substantially increases the memory footprint. As an example,
    a simple String "abcd", which should ideally take 4 bytes, takes 48 bytes in Java.

- en: What if we do away with GC and manage memory manually like in lower-level programming
    languages such as C? Java does provide a way to do that since 1.7 version and
    it is called `sun.misc.Unsafe`. Unsafe essentially means that you can build long
    regions of memory without any safety checks. This is the first feature of project
    Tungsten.

- en: Manual memory management by leverage application semantics, which can be very
    risky if you do not know what you are doing, is a blessing with Spark. We used
    knowledge of data schema (DataFrames) to directly layout the memory ourselves.
    It not only gets rid of GC overheads, but lets you minimize the memory footprint.

    CPU cache is great as it takes three cycles to get data from the main memory versus
    one cycle in cache. This is the second feature of project Tungsten.

    like expression evaluation. If this code generation is done manually, it is much
    more efficient. Code generation is the third feature of project Tungsten.

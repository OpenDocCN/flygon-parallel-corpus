- en: Deep learning is the focused study of machine learning algorithms that deploy
    neural networks as their main method of learning. Deep learning has exploded onto
    the scene just within the last couple of years. Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon,
    Apple, Tesla and many other companies are all utilizing deep learning models in
    their apps, websites, and products. At the same exact time, Spark, an in-memory
    compute engine running on top of big data sources, has made it easy to process
    volumes of information at record speeds and ease. In fact, Spark has now become
    the leading big data development tool for data engineers, machine learning engineers,
    and data scientists.

    Spark and deep learning allowed for a perfect marriage. Almost as important as
    the code used to execute deep learning algorithms is the work environment that
    enables optimal development. Many talented minds are eager to develop neural networks
    to help answer important questions in their research. Unfortunately, one of the
    greatest barriers to the development of deep learning models is access to the
    necessary technical resources required to learn on big data. The purpose of this
    chapter is to create an ideal virtual development environment for deep learning
    on Spark.

    on-premise or in the cloud. For our purposes, Spark will be installed on a Linux-based
    virtual machine with Ubuntu as the operating system. There are several advantages
    to using Ubuntu as the go-to virtual machine, not least of which is cost. Since
    they are based on open source software, Ubuntu operating systems are free to use
    and do not require licensing. Cost is always a consideration and one of the main
    goals of this publication is to minimize the financial footprint required to get
    started with deep learning on top of a Spark framework.

    end of life date in 2020; therefore, it is recommended that all new Python development
    be performed with Python 3, as will be the case in this publication. Up until
    recently, Spark was only available with Python 2\. That is no longer the case.
    Spark works with both Python 2 and 3. A convenient way to install Python 3, as
    well as many dependencies and libraries, is through Anaconda. Anaconda is a free
    and open source distribution of Python, as well as R. Anaconda manages the installation
    and maintenance of many of the most common packages used in Python for data science-related
    tasks.

    will begin to allow installation directly through the `pip` approach. We used
    the full installation method in this section to ensure that you will be able to
    get Spark installed and fully-integrated, in case you are using an earlier version
    of Spark.

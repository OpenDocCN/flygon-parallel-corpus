    in Python, such as TensorFlow and Keras. While these libraries are helpful to
    build deep neural networks without getting deep into the calculus and linear algebra
    of deep learning, this chapter will do a deep dive into building a simple neural
    network in PySpark to make a gender prediction based on height and weight. One
    of the best ways to understand the foundation of neural networks is to build a
    model from scratch, without any of the popular deep learning libraries. Once the
    foundation for a neural network framework is established, understanding and utilizing
    some of the more popular deep neural network libraries will become much simpler.

    This is fine for testing and development purposes as we are doing in this chapter;
    however, we may run into performance issues if we deployed this to production. 
    In production, it is recommended to use `.master('local[*]')` to set Spark to
    run on as many worker nodes that are available locally as possible. If we had
    3 cores on our machine and we wanted to set our node count to match that, we would

    helpful in understanding this section and the rest of the chapter.  Each neural
    network has inputs and outputs.  In our case, the inputs are the height and weight
    of the individuals and the output is the gender.  In order to get to the output,
    the inputs are multiplied with values (also known as weights: w1 and w2) and then
    a bias (b) is added to the end.  This equation is known as the summation function,
    z, and is given the following equation:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The weights and the bias are initially just random generated values that can
    be performed with `numpy`. The weights will literally add weight to inputs by
    increasing or decreasing their impact on the output. The bias will serve a slightly
    different role in that it will shift the baseline of the summation (z) upwards
    or downwards, depending on what is needed to meet the prediction. Each value of
    z is then converted into a predicted value between 0 and 1 through an activation
    function.  The activation function is a converter that gives us a value that we
    can convert into a binary output (male/female). The predicted output is then compared
    with the actual output.  Initially, the difference between the predicted and actual
    output will be large as the weights will be random when first starting out.  However,
    a process known as backpropagation is used to minimize the difference between
    the actual and the predicted using a technique known as gradient descent.  Once
    we settle on a negligible difference between the actual and predicted, we store
    the values of w1, w2, and b for the neural network.

    the local minimum of a function. Gradient descent will be discussed later on in

    height and weight, the entire dataset can be graphed and scored using every data
    point to determine whether the output is going to score a female or a male.

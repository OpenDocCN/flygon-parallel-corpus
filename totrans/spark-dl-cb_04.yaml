    the learning and prediction of sequential data. However, when it comes to natural
    language, the question of long-term dependencies comes into play, which is basically
    remembering the context of a particular conversation, paragraph, or sentence in
    order to make better predictions in the future. For example, consider a sentence
    that says:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the preceding sentence were fed into a recurrent neural network to predict
    the next word in the sentence (such as Chinese), the network would find it difficult
    since it has no memory of the context of the sentence. This is what we mean by
    long-term dependencies. In order to predict the word Chinese correctly, the network
    needs to know the context of the sentence as well as remember the fact that I
    happened to visit China last year. Recurrent neural networks therefore become
    inefficient at performing such tasks. However, this problem is overcome by **Long
    Short-Term Memory Units** (**LSTMs**), which are capable of remembering long-term
    dependencies and storing information in the cell state. LSTMs will be discussed
    later on, but the bulk of this chapter will focus on a basic introduction to Neural
    Networks, activation functions, Recurrent Networks, some of the main pain points
    or drawbacks of Recurrent Networks, and finally how these drawbacks may be overcome
    by the use of LSTMs.

    feedforward networks. Both of these networks are named after the way they move
    information through a series of mathematical operations performed at the nodes
    of the network. One feeds information in only one direction through every node
    (never touching a given node twice), while the other cycles it through a loop
    and feeds it back to the same node (kind of like a feedback loop). It is easily
    understood how the first kind is called a **feedforward network,** while the latter

- en: The second gate is called the **update gate** and its primary function is to
    update the cell state based on the current input. This gate passes the same input
    as the forget gate's inputs (*h**[t-1]* and *x**[t]*) into a sigmoid activation
    layer (![](img/00141.jpeg)) followed by a tanh activation layer and then performs
    an element-wise multiplication between these two results. Next, element-wise addition
    is performed with the result and the current state (illustrated by the second
    operation in the preceding diagram).

    information gets transferred to the adjoining cell to act as its inputs during
    the next time step. The current cell state is passed through a tanh activation
    layer and multiplied element-wise with the cell input (*h**[t-1]* and *x**[t]*)
    after being passed through a sigmoid layer (![](img/00141.jpeg)) for this operation.

- en: The update gate behaves as the filter on what the cell decides to output to
    the next cell. This output, h[t], is then passed on to the next LSTM cell as its
    input, and also to the above layers if many LSTM cells are stacked on top of each
    other.

- en: LSTMs were a big leap forward when compared to what could be accomplished with
    feedforward networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. One might wonder what the
    next big step in the near future is, or even what that step might be. A lot researchers
    do believe "attention" is the next big step when it comes to the field of artificial
    intelligence. With the amount of data growing vastly with each day it becomes
    impossible to process every single bit of that data. This is where attention could
    be a potential game-changer, causing the networks to give their attention only
    to data or areas which are of high priority or interest and disregard useless
    information. For example, if an RNN is being used to create an image captioning
    engine, it will only pick a part of the image to to give its attention to for
    every word it outputs.

    attention to LSTM cells. Reading this paper can be a good place to start learning
    about the use of attention in neural networks. There have been some good results
    with using attention for various tasks, and more research is currently being conducted
    on the subject. The paper by Xu, et al. can be found using the following link:'

- en: Classification models are a popular way to predict a defined categorical outcome.
    We use outputs from classification models all the time. Anytime we go to see a
    movie in a theatre, we are interested to know whether the film is considered correct?
    One of the most popular classification models in the data science community is
    a logistic regression. The logistic regression model produces a response that
    is activated by a sigmoid function. The sigmoid function uses the inputs from
    the model and produces an output that is between 0 and 1\. That output is usually
    in a form of a probability score. Many deep learning models are also used for
    classification purposes. It is common to find logistic regression models performed
    in conjunction with deep learning models to help establish a baseline in which
    deep learning models are measured against. The sigmoid activation function is
    one of many activation functions that are also used in deep neural networks within
    deep learning to produce a probability output. We will utilize the built-in machine
    learning libraries within Spark to build a logistic regression model that will
    predict whether an incoming call to the San Francisco Fire department is actually
    related to a fire, rather than another incident.

- en: Classification models work best when all of the features are combined in a single
    vector for training purposes. Therefore, we begin the vectorization process by
    collecting all of the features into a single list called `features`. Since our
    label is the first column of the dataframe, we exclude it and pull in every column
    after as a feature column or feature variable.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The vectorization process continues by converting all of the variables from
    the `features` list into a single vector output to a column called `features`.
    This process requires importing `VectorAssembler` from `pyspark.ml.feature`.

    are the label column, `fireIndicator`, and the `features` column. All of the other

    counter-intuitive is that our probability threshold is set at 50 percent in our
    dataframe. Any call with a probability of 0.500 and above is given a prediction
    of 0.0 and any call with a probability of less than 0.500 is given a prediction of
    1.0\. This was set during the pipeline development process and as long as we are
    aware of what the threshold is along with how the prediction is allocated, we
    are in good shape.

- en: It is important to note that not all false scores are created equal. For example,
    it is more detrimental to classify a call as not relating to fire and ultimately
    have it be related to fire than vice-versa from a fire safety perspective. This
    is referred to as a false negative. There is a metric that accounts for a **false
    negative** (**FN**), known as **recall**.

    for labels and the predicted values we derived from the logistic regression model.

    score is calculated using the `accuracy_score()` function, as seen in the following

    other words, it has a prediction rate of *100 - 14.94* percent, which is 85.06
    percent for a value of 0\. Therefore, since 85.06 percent is less than the model
    prediction rate of 88.4 percent, this model provides an improvement over a blind
    guess as to whether a call is fire-related or not.

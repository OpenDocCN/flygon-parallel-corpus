- en: Stock market predictions have been going on for many years and it has spawned
    an entire industry of prognosticators. It shouldn't come as a surprise since it
    can turn a significant profit if predicted properly. Understanding when is a good
    time to buy or sell a stock is key to getting the upper hand on Wall Street. This
    chapter will focus on creating a deep learning model using LSTM on Keras to predict
    the stock market quote of AAPL.

    as we are using a relatively small dataset, the conversion to a `pandas` dataframe
    means that all of the data is loaded into the memory of the driver.  Once this
    conversion occurs, the data is not stored in the Spark worker nodes but is instead
    to the main driver node.  This is not optimal and may produce an out of memory
    error.  If you find that you need to convert to a `pandas` dataframe from Spark

- en: The `LSTM` model that has been built will be defined using a `Sequential` class
    that works well with time series that are sequence dependent. The LSTM model has
    an `input_shape = (1,5)` for one dependent variable and five independent variables
    in our training dataset. Only one `Dense` layer will be used to define the neural
    network as we are looking to keep the model simple. A loss function is required
    when compiling a model in keras, and since we are performing it on a recurrent
    neural network, a `mean_squared_error` calculation is best to determine how close
    the predicted value is to the actual value. Finally, an optimizer is also defined
    when the model is compiled to adjust the weights in the neural network. `adam`
    has given good results, especially when being used with recurrent neural networks.

- en: The LSTM model is fit with `xtrain` and `ytrain` and the batch size is set to
    10 with 100 epochs. The batch size is the setting that defines the number of objects
    that are trained together. We can go as low or as high as we like in terms of
    setting the batch size, keeping in mind that the lower the number of batches,
    the more memory is required. Additionally, an epoch is a measurement of how often
    the model goes through the entire dataset. Ultimately, these parameters can be
    tuned based on time and memory allotment.

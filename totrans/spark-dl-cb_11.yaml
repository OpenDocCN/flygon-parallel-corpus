- en: Before training a neural network on text data and generating text using LSTM
    cells, it is important to understand how text data (such as words, sentences,
    customer reviews, or stories) is converted to word vectors first before it is
    fed into a neural network. This chapter will describe how to convert a text into
    a corpus and generate word vectors from the corpus, which makes it easy to group
    similar words using techniques such as Euclidean distance calculation or cosine
    distance calculation between different word vectors.

- en: The first step is to acquire some data to work with. For this chapter, we will
    require a lot of text data to convert it into tokens and visualize it to understand
    how neural networks rank word vectors based on Euclidean and Cosine distances.
    It is an important step in understanding how different words get associated with
    each other. This, in turn, can be used to design better, more efficient language
    and text-processing models.

    we have used the *Game of Thrones* books as the input text to our model. However,

    are easily able to interpret and process many dimensions during their computations.

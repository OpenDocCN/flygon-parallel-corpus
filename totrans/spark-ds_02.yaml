    has become widespread due to the availability of open source frameworks, with
    Hadoop being a popular choice. These frameworks are quite successful in executing
    specific tasks such as **Extract, Transform, and Load** (**ETL**) and storage
    applications that deal with web-scale data. However, developers were left with
    a myriad of tools to work with, along with the well-established Hadoop ecosystem.
    There was a need for a single, general-purpose development platform that caters
    to batch, streaming, interactive, and iterative requirements. This was the motivation
    behind Spark.

    of its concise programming interface, an interactive shell, and its ability to

    DAG scheduler then splits the DAG into logical units of work (for example, map

    is assigned to an executor (worker) by the task scheduler. Jobs may be executed

    machine in the cluster may have one or more worker instances (default one). A
    worker node executes one or more executors that belong to one or more Spark applications.
    It consists of a *block manager* component, which is responsible for managing
    data blocks. The blocks can be cached RDD data, intermediate shuffled data, or
    broadcast data. When the available RAM is not sufficient, it automatically moves
    some data blocks to disk. Data replication across nodes is another responsibility
    of block manager.

    These variables cannot be used to propagate results (for example, intermediate
    work counts) back to the driver program. Shared variables are used for this purpose.
    There are two kinds of shared variables, **broadcast variables** and **accumulators**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Broadcast variables enable the programmers to retain a read-only copy cached
    on each node rather than shipping a copy of it with tasks. If large, read-only
    data is used in multiple operations, it can be designated as broadcast variables
    and shipped only once to all worker nodes. The data broadcast in this way is cached
    in serialized form and is deserialized before running each task. Subsequent operations
    can access these variables along with the local variables moved along with the
    code. Creating broadcast variables is not necessary in all cases, except the ones
    where tasks across multiple stages need the same read-only copy of the data.

    and managed by a **lineage graph**. These RDD transformations may be viewed as
    piped UNIX commands where the output of one command becomes the input to the next
    command and so on. Each resulting RDD of a *transformation* step has a pointer
    to its parent RDD and also has a function for calculating its data. The RDD is
    acted on only after encountering an *action* statement. So, the *transformations*
    are lazy operations used to define new RDDs and *actions* launch a computation
    to return a value to the program or write data to external storage. We will discuss
    this aspect a little more in the following sections.

    HDFS, filesystems, RDBMS, NOSQL data structures, or any other data source. The

    such as a filesystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An RDD is composed of one or more data sources, maybe after performing a series
    of transformations including several operators. Every RDD or RDD partition knows
    how to recreate itself in case of failure. It has the log of transformations,
    or a *lineage* that is required to recreate itself from stable storage or another
    RDD. Thus, any program using Spark can be assured of built-in fault tolerance,
    regardless of the underlying data source and the type of RDD.

    Transformations are the methods that are used to create RDDs. Actions are the
    methods that utilize RDDs. RDDs are usually partitioned. Users may choose to persist
    RDDs that may be reused in their programs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: RDDs are immutable (read-only) data structures, so any transformation results
    in the creation of a new RDD. The transformations are applied lazily, only when
    any action is applied on them, and not when an RDD is defined. An RDD is recomputed
    every time it is used in an action unless the user explicitly persists the RDD
    in memory. Saving in memory saves a lot of time. If the memory is not sufficient
    to accommodate the RDD fully, the remaining portion of that RDD will be stored
    (spilled) on the hard disk automatically. One advantage of lazy transformations
    is that it is possible to optimize the transformation steps. For example, if the
    action is to return the first line, Spark computes only a single partition and
    skips the rest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An RDD may be viewed as a set of partitions (splits) with a list of dependencies
    on parent RDDs and a function to compute a partition given its parents. Sometimes,
    each partition of a parent RDD is used by a single child RDD. This is called *narrow
    dependency*. Narrow dependency is desirable because when a parent RDD partition
    is lost, only a single child partition needs to be recomputed. On the other hand,
    computing a single child RDD partition that involves operations such as *group-by-keys*
    depends on several parent RDD partitions. Data from each parent RDD partition
    in turn is required in creating data in several child RDD partitions. Such a dependency
    is called *wide dependency*. In the case of narrow dependency, it is possible
    to keep both parent and child RDD partitions on a single node (co-partition).
    But this is not possible in the case of wide dependency because parent data is
    scattered across several partitions. In such cases, data should be *shuffled*
    across partitions. Data shuffling is a resource-intensive operation that should
    be avoided to the extent possible. Another issue with wide dependency is that
    all child RDD partitions need to be recomputed even when a single parent RDD partition
    is lost.

    method. The developer has the ability to override this default behavior and instruct
    to *persist* or *cache* a dataset in memory across partitions. If this dataset
    is required to participate in several actions, then persisting saves a significant
    amount of time, CPU cycles, disk I/O, and network bandwidth. The fault-tolerance
    mechanism is applicable to the cached partitions too. When any partition is lost
    due to node failure, it is recomputed using a lineage graph. If the available
    memory is insufficient, Spark gracefully spills the persisted partitions on to
    the disk. The developer may remove unwanted RDDs using *unpersist*. Nevertheless,
    Spark automatically monitors the cache and removes old partitions using **Least
    Recently Used** (**LRU**) algorithms.

    advantages and when to choose one language over the other. We discussed the design
    of the Spark engine along with its core components and their execution mechanism.
    We saw how Spark sends the data to be computed across many cluster nodes. We then
    discussed some RDD concepts. We learnt how to create RDDs and perform transformations
    and actions on them through both Scala and Python. We also discussed some advanced
    operations on RDDs.

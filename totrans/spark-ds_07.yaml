    in almost every field, ranging from bioinformatics to election campaigns. They
    prefer R due to its powerful visualization capabilities, strong community, and
    rich package ecosystem for statistics and machine learning. Many academic institutions
    around the world teach data science and statistics using the R language.

- en: R was originally created by and for statisticians in around the mid-1990s with
    a goal to deliver a better and more user-friendly way to perform data analysis.
    R was initially used in academics and research. As businesses became increasingly
    aware of the role of data science in their business growth, the number of data
    analysts using R in the corporate sector started growing as well. The R language
    user base is considered to be more than two million strong, after being in existence
    for two decades.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the driving factors behind all this success is the fact that R is designed
    to make the life of the analyst easier but not that of the computer. R is inherently
    single-threaded and it can only process datasets that completely fit in a single
    machine's memory. But nowadays, R users are working with increasingly larger datasets.
    Seamless integration of modern-day distributed processing power underneath the
    well-established R language allows data scientists to leverage the best of both
    worlds. They can keep up with their ever-increasing business demands and continue
    to benefit from the flexibility of their favorite R language.

    is an R package that provides a lightweight frontend to enable Apache Spark access
    from R. The goal of SparkR is to combine the flexibility and ease of use provided
    by the R environment and the scalability and fault tolerance provided by the Spark
    compute engine. Let us recap the Spark architecture before discussing how SparkR
    realizes its goal.

    and iterative computations on large, distributed datasets. It supports a wide
    variety of data sources as well as storage layers. It provides unified data access
    to combine different data formats, streaming data and defining complex operations
    using high-level, composable operators. You can develop your applications interactively
    using Scala, Python, or R shell (or Java without a shell). You can deploy it on
    your home desktop or you can run it on large clusters of thousands of nodes crunching
    petabytes of data.

    to explore different techniques to integrate the usability of R with the scalability
    of Spark. It was released as an alpha component in Apache Spark 1.4, which was
    released in June 2015\. The Spark 1.5 release had improved R usability and introduced
    the MLlib machine learning package with **Generalized Linear Models** (**GLMs**).
    The Spark 1.6 release that happened in January 2016 added some more features,
    such as model summary and feature interactions. The Spark 2.0 release that happened
    in July 2016 brought several important features, such as UDF, improved model coverage,
    DataFrames Window functions API, and so on.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the core of the Spark engine is its main data abstraction, called a **Resilient
    Distributed Dataset** (**RDD**). An RDD is composed of one or more data sources
    and is defined by the user as a series of transformations (aka lineage) on one
    or more stable (concrete) data sources. Every RDD or RDD partition knows how to
    recreate itself on failure using the lineage graph, thereby providing fault tolerance.
    RDD is an immutable data structure, implying that it is sharable between threads
    without synchronization overheads and hence amenable for parallelization. Operations
    on RDDs are either transformations or actions. Transformations are individual
    steps in the lineage. In other words, they are operations that create RDDs because
    every transformation is getting data from a stable data source or transforming
    an immutable RDD and creating another RDD. Transformations are simply declarations;
    they are not evaluated until an *action* operation is applied on that RDD. Actions
    are the operations that utilize the RDDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Spark optimizes RDD computation based on the action on hand. For example, if
    the action is to read the first line, only one partition is computed, skipping
    the rest. It automatically performs in-memory computation with graceful degradation
    (spills it to disk when memory is insufficient) and distributes processing across
    all the cores. You may cache an RDD if it is frequently accessed in your program
    logic, thereby avoiding recomputing overhead.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The R language provides a two-dimensional data structure called a *DataFrame*
    which makes data manipulation convenient. Apache Spark comes with its own DataFrames
    that are inspired by the DataFrame in R and Python (through Pandas). A Spark DataFrame
    is a specialized data structure that is built on top of the RDD data structure
    abstraction. It provides distributed DataFrame implementation that looks very
    similar to R DataFrame from the developer perspective and at the same time can
    support very large datasets. The Spark dataset API adds structure to DataFrames
    and this structure provides information for more optimization under the hood.

    `dplyr` and SparkR are again very close to the SQL keyword `GROUP BY`. But the
    sequence of these method calls is not the same. The example also showed an additional
    step of converting a Spark DataFrame to an R `data.frame` using `collect`. The
    methods are arranged inside out, in the sense that first the data is grouped,
    then summarized, and then arranged. This is understandable because in SparkR,

    predecessor and so on.

    on hand, if you are used to fetching data from RDBMS tables. But how are we doing
    this? The first statement tells Spark to register a temporary table (or, as the
    name suggests, a view, a logical abstraction of a table). This is not exactly
    the same as a database table. It is temporary in the sense that it is destroyed
    when the SparkSession object is destroyed. You are not explicitly writing data
    into any RDBMS datastore (you have to use `SaveAsTable` for that). But when once
    you register a Spark DataFrame as a temporary table, you are free to use SQL syntax
    to operate on that DataFrame. The next statement is a basic `SELECT` statement
    that displays column names followed by five rows, as dictated by the `LIMIT` keyword.
    The next SQL statement created a Spark DataFrame containing a Species column followed
    by two average columns sorted on the average sepal length. This DataFrame is in
    turn collected as an R `data.frame` by using collect. The final result is exactly
    the same as the preceding example. You are free to use either syntax. For more

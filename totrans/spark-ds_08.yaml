- en: In this Big Data era, the proliferation of unstructured data is overwhelming.
    Numerous methods such as data mining, **Natural Language Processing** (**NLP**),
    information retrieval, and so on, exist for analyzing unstructured data. Due to
    the rapid growth of unstructured data in all kinds of businesses, scalable solutions
    have become the need of the hour. Apache Spark is equipped with out of the box
    algorithms for text analytics, and it also supports custom development of algorithms
    that are not available by default.

    the eighties and nineties. Tremendous improvements in computing power, sophisticated
    algorithms, and an open source culture fueled unprecedented growth in data analytics,
    as well as in other fields. These advances in technologies paved the way for new
    opportunities and new challenges. Businesses started looking at generating insights
    from hitherto impossible to handle data sources such as internal memos, emails,
    customer satisfaction surveys, and the like. Data analytics now encompass this
    unstructured, usually text based data along with traditional rows and columns
    of data. Between the highly structured data stored in RDBMS table and completely
    unstructured plain text, we have semi-structured data sources in NoSQL data stores,
    XML or JSON documents, and graph or network data sources. As per current estimates,
    unstructured data forms about 80 percent of enterprise data and is growing rapidly.
    Satellite images, atmospheric data, social networks, blogs and other web pages,
    patient records and physicians' notes, companies' internal communications, and
    so on - all these combined are just a subset of unstructured data sources.

    data along with structured data. Some of the companies leverage the power of social
    networks to provide actionable insights to their customers. New fields such as
    **Sentiment Analysis** and **Multimedia Analytics** are emerging to draw insights
    from unstructured data. However, analyzing unstructured data is still a daunting
    feat. For example, contemporary text analytics tools and techniques cannot identify
    sarcasm. However, the potential benefits undoubtedly outweigh the limitations.

    data frames. First example takes some text as input and extracts all date-like
    strings whereas the second example extracts tags from twitter text. First example
    is just a warm-up, using a simple, regex (regular expression) tokenizer feature
    transformer without using any spark-specific libraries. It also draws your attention
    to the possibility of misinterpretation. For example, a product code of the form
    1-11-1111 may be interpreted as a date. The second example illustrates a non-trivial,
    multi-step extraction process that resulted in just the required tags. **User
    defined functions** (**udf**) and ML pipelines come in handy in developing such
    multi-step extraction processes. Remaining part of this section describes some

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency** (**TF-IDF**) is perhaps one
    of the most popular measures in text analytics. This metric indicates the importance
    of a given term in a given document within a set of documents. This consists two
    measurements, **Term Frequency** (**TF**) and **Inverse Document Frequency** (**IDF**).
    Let us discuss them one by one and then see their combined effect.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TF is a measure of the relative importance of a term in a document, which is
    usually the frequency of that term divided by the number of terms in that document.
    Consider a text document containing 100 words wherein the word *apple* appears
    eight times. The TF for *apple* would be *TF = (8 / 100) = 0.08*. So, the more
    frequently a term occurs in a document, the larger is its TF coefficient.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: IDF is a measure of the importance of a particular term in the entire collection
    of documents, that is, how infrequently the word occurs across all the documents.
    The importance of a term is inversely proportional to its frequency. Spark provides
    two separate methods to perform these tasks. Assume we have 6 million documents
    and the word *apple* appears in 6000 of these. Then, IDF is calculated as *IDF
    = Log(6,000,000 / 6,000) = 3*. If you observe this carefully, the lower the denominator,
    the higher is the IDF value. This means that the fewer the number of documents
    containing a particular word, the higher would be its importance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the TF-IDF score would be *TF * IDF = 0.08 * 3 = 0.24*. Note that it would
    penalize the words that are more frequent across documents and less important,
    such as *the*, *this*, *a*, and so on, and give more weight to the ones that are
    important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Spark, TF is implemented as HashingTF. It takes a sequence of terms (often
    the output of a tokenizer) and produces a fixed length features vector. It performs
    feature hashing to convert the terms into fixed length indices. IDF then takes
    that features vector (the output of HashingTF) as input and scales it based on
    the term frequency in the set of documents. The previous chapter has an example
    of this transformation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Common words such as *is*, *was*, and *the* are called stop-words. They do not
    usually add value to analysis and should be dropped during the data preparation
    step. Spark provides `StopWordsRemover` transformer, which does just that. It
    takes a sequence of tokens as a series of string inputs, such as the output of
    a tokenizer, and removes all the stop words. Spark has a stop-words list by default
    that you may override by providing your own stop-words list as a parameter. You
    may optionally turn on `caseSensitive` match which is off by default.

- en: Normalization is a common and preliminary step in data preparation. Most of
    the machine learning algorithms work better when all features are on the same
    scale. For example, if there are two features where the value of one is about
    100 times greater than the other, bringing them to the same scale reflects meaningful
    relative activity between the two variables. Any non-numeric values, such as high,
    medium, and low, should ideally be converted to appropriate numerical quantification
    as a best practice. However, you need to be careful in doing so as it may require
    domain expertise. For example, if you assign 3, 2, and 1 for high, medium, and
    low respectively, then it should be checked that these three units are equidistant
    from each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The common methods of feature normalization are *scaling*, *mean subtraction*,
    and *feature standardization*, just to name a few. In scaling, each numerical
    feature vector is rescaled such that its value range is between *-1* to *+1* or
    *0* to *1* or something similar. In mean subtraction, you compute mean of a numerical
    feature vector and subtract that mean from each of the values. We are interested
    in the relative deflection from the mean, while the absolute value could be immaterial.
    Feature standardization refers to setting the data to zero mean and unit (1) variance.

    are 0 and 1 but you may set the value parameters yourself as per the data requirement.

    and is one of the best classification algorithms. It assumes strong independence
    between every pair of features. It computes the conditional probability distribution
    of each feature and a given label, and then applies Bayes' theorem to compute
    the conditional probability of a label given an observation. In terms of document
    classification, an observation is a document to be classified into some class.
    Despite its strong assumptions on data, it is quite popular. It works with small
    amount of training data - whether real or discrete. It works very efficiently
    because it takes a single pass through the training data; one constraint is that
    the feature vectors must be non-negative. By default, ML package supports multinomial
    NB. However, you may set the parameter `modelType` to `Bernoulli` if bernoulli
    NB is required.

    through trial and error. One way is to progressively increase the *K* value and
    compute the cluster quality, such as cluster variance. The quality ceases to improve
    significantly beyond a certain value of *K,* which could be your ideal *K*. There

    They are considered as the underlying *concepts* or *components* that connect
    the rows and columns of the matrix. Their magnitude represents the strength of
    the corresponding components. For example, imagine that the matrix in the previous
    example contains ratings of five books by six readers. SVD allows us to split
    them into three matrices: *∑* containing the singular values representing the
    *strength* of underlying topics; *U* connecting people to concepts; and *V* connecting
    concepts to books.'

- en: In a large matrix, we can replace the lower magnitude singular values to zero
    and thereby reduce the corresponding rows in the remaining two matrices. Note
    that if we re-compute the matrix product on the right hand side and compare the
    value with the original matrix on the left hand side, they will be almost similar.
    We can use this technique to retain the desired number of dimensions.

- en: "**Principal Component Analysis** (**PCA**) is a technique that takes n-dimensional\
    \ data points and project onto a smaller (fewer dimensions) subspace with minimum\
    \ loss of information. A set of data points in a high dimensional space find the\
    \ directions along which these tuples line up best. In other words, we need to\
    \ find a rotation such that the first coordinate has the largest variance possible,\
    \ and each succeeding coordinate in turn has the largest variance possible. The\
    \ idea is to treat the set of tuples as a matrix *M* and fi\x81nd the eigenvectors\
    \ for MMT."

- en: If *A* is a square matrix, *e* is a column matrix with the same number of rows
    as *A*, and *λ* is a constant such that *Me = λe*, then *e* is called the eigenvector
    of *M* and *λ* is called the eigenvalue of *M*. In terms of n-dimensional plane,
    the eigenvector is the direction and the eigenvalue is a measure of variance along
    that direction. We can drop the dimensions with a low eigenvalue, thereby finding
    a smaller subspace without loss of information.

- en: In this chapter, we examined the sources of unstructured data and the motivation
    behind analyzing the unstructured data. We explained various techniques that are
    required in pre-processing unstructured data and how Spark provides most of these
    tools out of the box. We also covered some of the algorithms supported by Spark
    that can be used in text analytics.

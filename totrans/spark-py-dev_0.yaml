- en: '*Spark for Python Developers* aims to combine the elegance and flexibility
    of Python with the power and versatility of Apache Spark. Spark is written in
    Scala and runs on the Java virtual machine. It is nevertheless polyglot and offers
    bindings and APIs for Java, Scala, Python, and R. Python is a well-designed language
    with an extensive set of specialized libraries. This book looks at PySpark within
    the PyData ecosystem. Some of the prominent PyData libraries include Pandas, Blaze,
    Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh. These libraries are open source.
    They are developed, used, and maintained by the data scientist and Python developers
    community. PySpark integrates well with the PyData ecosystem, as endorsed by the
    Anaconda Python distribution. The book puts forward a journey to build data-intensive
    apps along with an architectural blueprint that covers the following steps: first,
    set up the base infrastructure with Spark. Second, acquire, collect, process,
    and store the data. Third, gain insights from the collected data. Fourth, stream
    live data and process it in real time. Finally, visualize the information.'

    building apps that analyze the Spark community's interactions on social networks.
    The focus is on Twitter data.

    *Setting Up a Spark Virtual Environment*, covers how to create a segregated virtual
    machine as our sandbox or development environment to experiment with Spark and
    PyData libraries. It covers how to install Spark and the Python Anaconda distribution,
    which includes PyData libraries. Along the way, we explain the key Spark concepts,
    the Python Anaconda ecosystem, and build a Spark word count app.'

    *Building Batch and Streaming Apps with Spark*, lays the foundation of the *Data
    Intensive Apps Architecture*. It describes the five layers of the apps architecture
    blueprint: infrastructure, persistence, integration, analytics, and engagement.
    We establish API connections with three social networks: Twitter, GitHub, and
    Meetup. This chapter provides the tools to connect to these three nontrivial APIs
    so that you can create your own data mashups at a later stage.'

    with Spark*, covers how to harvest data from Twitter and process it using Pandas,
    Blaze, and SparkSQL with their respective implementations of the dataframe data
    structure. We proceed with further investigations and techniques using Spark SQL,
    leveraging on the Spark dataframe data structure.'

    from Data Using Spark*, gives an overview of the ever expanding library of algorithms
    of Spark MLlib. It covers supervised and unsupervised learning, recommender systems,
    optimization, and feature extraction algorithms. We put the Twitter harvested
    dataset through a Python Scikit-Learn and Spark MLlib K-means clustering in order
    to segregate the *Apache Spark* relevant tweets.'

    Live Data with Spark*, lays down the foundation of streaming architecture apps
    and describes their challenges, constraints, and benefits. We illustrate the streaming
    concepts with TCP sockets, followed by live tweet ingestion and processing directly
    from the Twitter firehose. We also describe Flume, a reliable, flexible, and scalable
    data ingestion and transport pipeline system. The combination of Flume, Kafka,
    and Spark delivers unparalleled robustness, speed, and agility in an ever-changing
    landscape. We end the chapter with some remarks and observations on two streaming
    architectural paradigms, the Lambda and Kappa architectures.'

    Insights and Trends*, focuses on a few key visualization techniques. It covers
    how to build word clouds and expose their intuitive power to reveal a lot of the
    key words, moods, and memes carried through thousands of tweets. We then focus
    on interactive mapping visualizations using Bokeh. We build a world map from the
    ground up and create a scatter plot of critical tweets. Our final visualization
    is to overlay an actual Google map of London, highlighting upcoming meetups and
    their respective topics.'

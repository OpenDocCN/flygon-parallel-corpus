- en: Due to its prevalence on the Web and other factors, JavaScript has become hard
    to avoid. That doesn’t mean that it is well liked, though. With this book, I’m
    hoping to convince you that, while you do have to accept a fair amount of quirks
    when using it, JavaScript is a decent language that makes you very productive
    and can be fun to program in.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though I have followed its development since its birth, it took me a long
    time to warm up to JavaScript. However, when I finally did, it turned out that
    my prior experience had already prepared me well, because I had worked with Scheme,
    Java (including GWT), Python, Perl, and Self (all of which have influenced JavaScript).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In 2010, I became aware of Node.js, which gave me hope that I’d eventually
    be able to use JavaScript on both server and client. As a consequence, I switched
    to JavaScript as my primary programming language. While learning it, I started
    writing a book chronicling my discoveries. This is the book you are currently
    reading. On my blog, I published parts of the book and other material on JavaScript.
    That helped me in several ways: the positive reaction encouraged me to keep going
    and made writing this book less lonely; comments to blog posts gave me additional
    information and tips (as acknowledged everywhere in this book); and it made people
    aware of my work, which eventually led to O’Reilly publishing this book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, this book has been over three years in the making. It has profited
    from this long gestation period, during which I continually refined its contents.
    I’m glad that the book is finally finished and hope that people will find it useful
    for learning JavaScript. O’Reilly has agreed to make it available to be read online,
    for free, which should help make it accessible to a broad audience.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has been written for programmers, by a programmer. So, in order to
    understand it, you should already know object-oriented programming, for example,
    via a mainstream programming language such as Java, PHP, C++, Python, Ruby, Objective-C,
    C#, or Perl.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the book’s target audience is programmers who want to learn JavaScript
    quickly and properly, and JavaScript programmers who want to deepen their skills
    and/or look up specific topics.

    find information on programming web browsers (DOM, asynchronous programming, etc.).
    However, [Chapter 33](ch33.html "Chapter 33. What to Do Next") points to relevant
    material.

    of information that can be used as an enabler for intercommunication and collaboration
    between heterogeneous components. It is composed of primarily two parts: header
    and payload. Headers contain metadata and commonly require values such as ID,
    timestamp, and so on, but a header''s use can be extended for passing other values
    as well, for example, a channel name for a router, file components for a filename,
    and so on. Payload can be of any type: standard Java object, XML, or any custom
    or user-defined value. It can be a simple information-sharing payload too (for
    example, a registration module can notify an audit module when a new user is registered),
    or it can be a command (for example, an administration module can instruct the
    mail service to notify all the users who''ve registered for the course), or it
    can be an event (for example, a mail service that, after sending all the mails,
    dispatches an event back to the admin module specifying that all the mails have
    been sent and it''s good to go with the next step).'

    via these messages—in formal terms, we call these components message endpoints.
    Similarly, we can observe that message endpoints are of two types: producer endpoint
    and consumer endpoint. As their names suggest, a producer, such as `registration
    module`, generates a message in the given example, while a consumer consumes it—for
    example the `audit module` in the given example. An endpoint can be a producer
    as well as a consumer, for example, a mail service. Endpoints are typically smart
    components that can validate messages before passing them on to the next subsystem
    or can route, filter, aggregate, transform, or do a lot more so that the message
    can be in a format expected by the next in the chain.'

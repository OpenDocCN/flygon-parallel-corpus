- en: One of the most common and primitive ways to communicate is through files. Even
    after the introduction of databases, the filesystem has not lost its relevance
    and we frequently need to deal with them—in legacy applications, for dumping reports,
    shared locations, and so on.

- en: So, how do you work with files in Java? Get the file handle, open a stream,
    work over it, and then close it. Some trivial stuff would take 10-15 lines of
    code. However, what if you forget to close the stream or the referenced file has
    been removed? The lines of code go on increasing as we handle all the corner cases.
    Spring Integration has very good support for files. It provides adapters and gateways
    that can handle file reading and writing operations with minimal lines of code.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Filter is a powerful concept that can be used to prevent duplicates, select
    files based on name patterns, customize the list of files read, and perform many
    more interceptions before the required content can be presented to the next endpoint.
    There are predefined filters available for most common tasks, but in the true
    spirit of spring, we can have custom implementations as well and inject them in
    adapters provided by Spring Integration. Filters must be an instance of `FileListFilter`,
    and the default filter used is `AcceptOnceFileListFilter`. This filter keeps track
    of processed files, but the implementation is in-memory. This means that if the
    server restarts when files are being processed, it will lose track of which files
    have been processed and will re-read the same files. To overcome this issue, an
    instance of `FileSystemPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` should be used, which
    will keep track of processed files by leveraging the `MetadataStore` implementation.

    already been picked up. Using `prevent-duplicates`, we can instruct an adapter
    to look for unique files only. The only glitch here is that a duplicate check
    is limited to a session, as the reader does not store any state. If the reader
    restarts, it will read all the files again—even though they have been read earlier.

    In our case, it's an in-memory database, that is, H2\. It will execute the query
    and issue an update. The result will be put on the configured channel. The update
    query is very handy when we want to filter out already processed records in the
    next polling cycle.

    provides when it comes to handling complicated integrations, be it file-based,
    HTTP, JMS, or any other integration mechanism. Do not panic; I promise that the
    next few chapters are going to be smaller, and we will cover the testability of
    Spring Integration, performance, management, and then wrap up with an end-to-end
    example. In the next chapter, we will cover how Spring Batch and Spring Integration
    can be integrated to leverage the best of each framework.

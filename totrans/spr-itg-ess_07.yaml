    software. All of these are interactive, which means they take user input and respond
    in real time. They might not even be aware of other kinds of applications—applications
    that run in the background, do not need continuous user interaction, and may go
    on for hours, days, or even weeks! Yes, I am talking about the batch job that
    is typically used for offline processing such as file type conversions, reporting,
    data mining, and so on. In the early days, machines were too slow and someone
    had to sit for hours to get a simple job done. In batch processing, you submit
    jobs and then go and do other work—you only come to collect the result! This revolutionized
    the computing world and justified the exorbitantly high prices of equipment and
    programmers. It would not be an exaggeration to say that batch jobs showed the
    real power and usefulness of computers.

    modular approach, each module works independently and at the same time provides
    the necessary interfaces to be easily integrated with others in the family. Spring
    Integration can interact with the Spring Batch module via messaging and can provide
    an event-driven mechanism to trigger batch jobs. This chapter will cover two aspects:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Architecture allows you to achieve and maintain the requisite qualities of software.
    Being mindful and caring about it prevents a project from having accidental architecture,
    thereby losing quality, and also prevents software decay.

  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No. Agile is about empowering the whole team. An architect brings their experience
    and knowledge to the table, but if a decision has to be accepted by the whole
    team, the team should own it, not just the architect. Considering the needs of
    stakeholders is also of great importance here.

  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following the SRP leads to better cohesion. If a component starts having multiple
    responsibilities, usually it becomes less cohesive. In such instances, it's best
    to just refactor it into multiple components, each having a single responsibility.
    This way, we increase cohesiveness, so the code becomes easier to understand,
    develop, and maintain.

    an architect?
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An architect can bring value to a project from its inception until the time
    it goes into maintenance. The most value can be achieved during the early phases
    of the project's development, as this is where key decisions about how it should
    look will be taken. However, this doesn't mean that architects cannot be valuable
    during development. They can keep the project on the right course and on track.
    By aiding decisions and overseeing the project, they ensure that the code doesn't
    end up with accidental architecture and is not subject to software decay.

  prefs:

    request. A broker only knows where to send each request, so it's a lightweight
    component. It can be used to create a publisher-subscriber (pub-sub) architecture.

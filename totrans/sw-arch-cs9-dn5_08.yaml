    Enterprise Application*, software systems are organized into layers, and each
    layer communicates with the previous and next layers through interfaces that don''t
    depend on how the layer is implemented. When the software is a business/enterprise
    system, it usually contains at least three layers: the data layer, the business
    layer, and the presentation layer. In general, the interface that''s offered by
    each layer and the way the layer is implemented depends on the application.'

    standard, since they just map data from a data storage subsystem into objects
    and vice versa. This led to the conception of general-purpose frameworks for implementing
    data layers in a substantially declarative way. These tools are called **Object-Relational
    Mapping** (**ORM**) tools since they are data storage subsystems based on relational
    databases. However, they also work well with the modern non-relational storage
    classified as NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB and Azure Cosmos DB) since their
    data model is closer to the target object model than a purely relational model.

- en: ORMs map relational DB tables into in-memory collections of objects where object
    properties correspond to DB table fields. Types from C#, such as Booleans, numeric
    types, and strings, have corresponding DB types. If GUIDs are not available in
    the mapped database, then types such as GUIDs are mapped to their equivalent string
    representations. All date and time types are mapped either to C# `DateTime` when
    date/time contains no time zone information or to `DateTimeOffset` when date/time
    also contains explicit time zone information. Any DB time duration is mapped to
    a `TimeSpan`. Finally, single characters should not be mapped at all to DB fields.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since the string properties of most object-oriented languages have no length
    limits associated with them (while DB string fields usually have length limits),
    the DB limits are taken into account in the DB mapping configuration. In general,
    when the mapping between DB types and object-oriented language types needs options
    to be specified, these options are declared in the mapping configuration.

    conventions only for specifying the principal key with an ID property name, since
    I find that relying on name conventions also for more complex settings is very
    dangerous. In fact, there are no compilation-time checks on name conventions so
    a reengineering operation might erroneously change or destroy some ORM settings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I use data annotations mainly for specifying constraints on the possible values
    of properties, such as the maximum length of a value, or the fact that a property
    is obligatory and can't be null. In fact, these constraints restrict the type
    specified in each property, so placing them next to the properties they are applied
    to increases the code's readability.

    a one-to-many relationship, the class that's mapped to the *one* side of the relationship
    contains a collection that is populated with the related objects on the *many*
    side of the relationship. On the other hand, the class mapped to the *many* side
    of the relationship has a simple property that is populated with a uniquely related
    object on the *one* side of the relationship.

- en: The whole database (or just a part of it) is represented by an in-memory cache
    class that contains a property for each collection that's mapped to a DB table.
    First, the query and update operations are performed on an instance of an in-memory
    cache class, and then this instance is synchronized with the database.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The in-memory cache class that's used by Entity Framework Core is called `DbContext`
    and it also contains the mapping configuration. More specifically, the application-specific
    in-memory cache class is obtained by inheriting `DbContext` and adding it to all
    the mapped collections and all the necessary configuration information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Summing up, `DbContext` subclass instances contain partial snapshots of the
    DB that are synchronized with the database to get/update the actual data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: DB queries are performed with a query language made of method calls on the collections
    of the in-memory cache class. The actual SQL is created and executed during the
    synchronization stage. For instance, Entity Framework Core performs **Language
    Integrated Queries** (**LINQ**) on the collections mapped to the DB tables.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In general, LINQ queries produce `IEnumerable` instances, that is, collections
    whose elements are not computed when `IEnumerable` is created at the end of the
    query, but when you actually attempt to retrieve the collection elements from
    `IEnumerable`. This is called lazy evaluation or deferred execution. It works
    as follows:'
  prefs: []

    to the database, but the actual SQL is produced and executed when the first element
    of the `IQueryable` is retrieved.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, each Entity Framework query ends with a `ToList` or `ToArray` operation
    that transforms the `IQueryable` into a list or array, thereby causing the actual
    execution of the query on the database.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    we typically execute a `SingleOrDefault` operation that returns a single element,
    if any, or `null`.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, updates, deletions, and the addition of new entities to a DB table are
    performed by mimicking these operations on a `DbContext` collection property that
    represents the database table. However, entities may only be updated or deleted
    this way after they have been loaded in that memory collection by means of a query.
    An update query requires the in-memory representation of the entity to be modified
    as needed, while a delete query requires the in-memory representation of the entity
    to be removed from its in-memory mapped collection. In Entity Framework Core,
    the removal operation is performed by calling the `Remove(entity)` method of the
    collection.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The addition of a new entity has no further requirements. It is enough to add
    the new entity to the in-memory collection. Updates, deletions, and additions
    that are performed on various in-memory collections are actually passed to the
    database with an explicit call to a DB synchronization method.
  prefs: []

    on a `DbContext` instance to the database when you call the `DbContext.SaveChanges()`
    method.

- en: Changes that are passed to the database during a synchronization operation are
    executed in a single transaction. Moreover, for ORMs, such as Entity Framework
    Core, that have an explicit representation of transactions, a synchronization
    operation is executed in the scope of a transaction, since it uses that transaction
    instead of creating a new one.

    For instance, in our case, since `DestinationId` is an `int` (value type), it
    is obligatory. Therefore, the relationship here is one-to-many and not (0, 1)-to-many.
    Defining `DestinationId` as `int?`, instead of `int`, would turn the one-to-many

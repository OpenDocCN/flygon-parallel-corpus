    problems you encounter during software development. They are essential for understanding
    the .NET Core architecture and useful for solving ordinary problems that we face
    when designing any piece of software. In this chapter, we will look at the implementation
    of some design patterns. It is worth mentioning that this book does not explain
    all the known patterns we can use. The focus here is to explain the importance
    of studying and applying them.

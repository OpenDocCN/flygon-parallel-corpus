  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ASP.NET Core furnishes a set of configurable modules you can assemble according
    to your needs. Each module takes care of a functionality that you may or may not
    need. Examples of such functionalities are authorization, authentication, static
    file processing, protocol negotiation, CORS handling, and so on. Since most of
    the modules apply transformations to the incoming request and the final response,
    these modules are usually referred to as **middleware**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can put together all of the modules you need by inserting them into a common
    processing framework called the **ASP.NET Core pipeline**.
  prefs: []

    object through a pipeline of ASP.NET Core modules, as shown in the following diagram:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The object that is inserted into the pipeline is an `HttpContext` instance that
    contains the data of the incoming request. More specifically, the `Request` property
    of `HttpContext` contains an `HttpRequest` object whose properties represent the
    incoming request in a structured way. There are properties for headers, cookies,
    request path, parameters, form fields, and the request body.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The various modules can contribute to the construction of the final response
    if we write them in an `HttpResponse` object contained in the `Response` property
    of the `HttpContext` instance. The `HttpResponse` class is similar to the `HttpRequest`
    class, but its properties refer to the response being built.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some modules can build an intermediate data structure that is then used by other
    modules in the pipeline. In general, such intermediary data can be stored in custom
    entries of `IDictionary<object, object>`, which is contained in the `Items` property
    of the `HttpContext` object. However, there is a predefined property, `User`,
    that contains information about the currently logged-in user. The logged-in user
    is not computed automatically, so they must be computed by an authentication module.
    The *ASP.NET Core service authorization* subsection of *Chapter 14*, *Applying
    Service-Oriented Architectures with .NET Core*, explained how to add the standard
    module that performs JWT token-based authentication to the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

    dependency engine by calling the `.RequestService.GetService(Type t)` method or,
    even better, the `.GetRequiredService<TService>()` extension method that is built
    on top of it. However, as we will see in the remainder of this chapter, all types
    managed by the dependency injection engine are usually automatically injected
    into constructors, so these methods are only used when we''re building custom
    **middleware** or other customizations of the ASP.NET Core engine.'

    with controllers and with the methods of these controllers, where controllers
    are classes that inherit from the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller` class.
    Controllers are discovered by inspecting all of the application's `.dll` files
    and are added to the DI engine. This job is performed by the call to `AddControllersWithViews`
    in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `startup.cs` file.

    from the `controller` pattern variable, and the name of the controller method
    to invoke from the `action` pattern variable. Since, by convention, all controller
    names are expected to end with the `Controller` suffix, the actual controller
    type name is obtained from the name found in the `controller` variable by adding
    this suffix. Hence, for instance, if the name found in `controller` is `"Home"`,
    then the `UseEndpoints` module tries to get an instance of the `HomeController`
    type from the DI engine. All of the controller public methods can be selected
    by the routing rules. Use of a controller public method can be prevented by decorating
    it with the `[NonAction]` attribute. All controller methods available to the routing

    Architectures with .NET Core*. The only difference is that API controllers are
    expected to produce JSON or XML, while MVC controllers are expected to produce
    HTML. For this reason, while API controllers inherit from the `ControllerBase`
    class, MVC controllers inherit from the `Controller` class, which, in turn, inherits
    from the `ControllerBase` class and adds its methods that are useful for HTML
    generation, such as invoking views, which are described in the next subsection,

    routes have priority on `MapControllerRoute` patterns; otherwise, the opposite

    parameter name must match the header, query string, form, or pattern variable.
    When the parameter is a complex type, a match is searched for in each property,
    using the property name for the match. In the case of nested complex types, a
    match is searched for each nested property's path, and the name associated with
    the path is obtained by chaining all the property names in the path and separating
    them with dots. For instance, `Property1.Property2.Property3...Propertyn` is the
    name associated with a path composed by the nested properties `Property1`, `Property2`,
    ...., `Propertyn`. The name that's obtained this way must match a header name,
    pattern variable name, query string parameter name, and so on. For instance, an

    The basic idea is to apply a *Separation of Concerns* between the logic of the
    presentation layer and its graphics. Logic is taken care of by controllers, while
    graphics are factored out into views. Controllers and views communicate through
    the model, which is often called the ViewModel to distinguish it from the models
    of the business and data layers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, what is the logic of a presentation layer? In *Chapter 1*, *Understanding
    the Importance of Software Architecture*, we saw that software requirements can
    be documented with use cases that describe the interaction between the user and
    the system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Roughly speaking, the logic of the presentation layer consists of the management
    of use cases; hence, roughly, use cases are mapped to controllers and every single
    operation of a use case is mapped to an action method of those controllers. Hence,
    controllers take care of managing the protocol of interaction with the user and
    rely on the business layer for any business processing involved during each operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each action method receives data from the user, performs some business processing,
    and, depending on the results of this processing, decides what to show to the
    user and encodes it in the ViewModel. Views receive ViewModels that describe what
    to show to the user and decide the graphics to use; that is, the HTML to use.

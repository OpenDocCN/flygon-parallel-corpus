    the evolution of maturity in software development means there is a different way
    of thinking about it. Complexity does not mean a good job; it means poor code
    quality. Some incredible scientists and researchers have confirmed this theory
    and emphasize that professional code needs to be focused on time, high quality,
    and within budget.

    changes in the future, since change is inevitable. For this reason, consider refactoring
    your code if you have low levels of maintainability. Writing classes and methods

    and high cohesion. In software development, high cohesion indicates a scenario
    where you should have a software in which each class must have its methods and
    data with good relationships between them. On the other hand, low coupling indicates
    software where the classes are not closely and directly connected. This is a basic
    principle that can guide you to a better architectural model.

    This chapter introduced a tool for analyzing code metrics so that you can manage
    the complexity and maintainability of the software you are developing. To finish,
    we presented some good tips to guarantee that your software will not crash due
    to memory leaks and exceptions. In real life, a software architect will always
    be asked to solve this kind of problem.

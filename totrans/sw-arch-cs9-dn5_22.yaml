    further tools to simulate, somehow, the way the user acts in the UI. We will discuss
    this point further throughout the chapter. The need for extra tools is not the
    only challenge the UI brings with it, because UIs also see frequent and major
    changes. Thus, we mustn't design tests that depend on the UI's graphical details
    or we might be forced to completely rewrite all the tests at each UI change. That's
    why it is sometimes better to renounce automatic tests and fall back to manual
    tests.

    team and the stakeholder belong to the same company, there is no business contract.
    In this case, the stakeholder together with the team writes an internal document

    sprint is not rejected but the results of the tests are used to drive the specifications

    but, unluckily, functional tests are strictly tied to the way the UI is implemented,

    a test is executed with exactly the same UI no more than a couple of times.

- en: In order to overcome all the problems related to the UI, some functional tests
    can be implemented as **subcutaneous tests**, that is, as tests that bypass the
    UI. For instance, some functional tests for an ASP.NET Core application can call
    controller action methods directly instead of sending an actual request through
    a browser.
  prefs: []

    since they can't detect errors in the UI itself. Moreover, in the case of a web
    application, subcutaneous tests usually suffer from other limitations because
    they bypass the whole HTTP protocol.

    as mentioned earlier, are very expensive and difficult to implement. Therefore,
    the suggested approach of ASP.NET Core MVC is to send actual HTTP requests to
    an actual copy of the web application, with a .NET HTTP client instead of using
    a browser. Once the HTTP client receives an HTTP response, it parses it in a DOM
    tree and verifies that it received the right response.

    is more complex, since we also need tools for parsing and interacting with the
    HTML page DOM tree. The `AngleSharp` NuGet package is a great solution since it
    supports state-of-the-art HTML and minimal CSS and has extension points for externally
    provided JavaScript engines, such as Node.js. However, we don't advise you to
    include JavaScript and CSS in your tests, since they are strictly tied to target

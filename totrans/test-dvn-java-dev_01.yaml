    will be through code. Each chapter will present one or more **t****est-driven
    development** (**TDD**) practices and we'll try to master them by solving **katas**.
    In karate, a kata is an exercise where you repeat a form many times, making little
    improvements in each. Following the same philosophy, we'll be making small, but
    significant improvements from one chapter to the next. You'll learn how to design
    and code better, reduce **time to market** (**TTM**), produce always up-to-date
    documentation, obtain high code coverage through quality tests, and write clean
    code that works.

    fix the code so that all tests are passing. However, this is wrong. If a fix is
    not done in a matter of minutes, the best thing to do is to revert the changes.
    After all, everything worked not long ago. An implementation that broke something
    is obviously wrong, so why not go back to where we started and think again about
    the correct way to implement the test? That way, we wasted minutes on a wrong
    implementation instead of wasting much more time to correct something that was
    not done right in the first place. Existing test coverage (excluding the implementation
    of the last test) should be sacred. We change the existing code through intentional
    refactoring, not as a way to fix recently written code.

    the code better and more optimal without introducing new features. While refactoring
    is in place, all tests should be passing all the time.

    similar. TDD veterans tend not to spend more than a minute on either side of the
    table (test and implementation). Write a short test and run all tests (ping),
    write the implementation and run all tests (pong), write another test (ping),
    write the implementation of that test (pong), refactor and confirm that all tests
    are passing (score), and then repeat—ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, score,
    serve again. Do not try to make the perfect code. Instead, try to keep the ball
    rolling until you think that the time is right to score (refactor).

    implementation of just one thing at a time—organize your thoughts and better structure
    the code. This does not mean that tests resulting from TDD are useless—they are
    far from that. They are very useful and they allow us to develop with great speed
    without being afraid that something will be broken. This is especially true when

    test as a black box without knowing its internals. Tests use software interfaces
    and try to ensure that they work as expected. As long as the functionality of
    interfaces remains unchanged, tests should pass even if internals are changed.
    The tester is aware of what the program should do, but does not have the knowledge
    of how it does it. Black-box testing is the most commonly used type of testing
    in traditional organizations that have testers as a separate department, especially
    when they are not proficient in coding and have difficulties understanding it.

    they are trying to accomplish. Those objectives are often split between **quality
    checking** (**QC**) and **quality assurance** (**QA**). While QC is focused on
    defects identification, QA tries to prevent them. QC is product-oriented and intends
    to make sure that results are as expected. On the other hand, QA is more focused
    on processes that assure that quality is built-in. It tries to make sure that
    correct things are done in the correct way.

    the order in which they are written is very important.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Requirements (specifications and user stories) are written before the code that
    implements them. They come first so they define the code, not the other way around.
    The same can be said for tests. If they are written after the code is done, in
    a certain way, that code (and the functionalities it implements) is defining tests.
    Tests that are defined by an already existing application are biased. They have
    a tendency to confirm what code does, and not to test whether a client's expectations
    are met, or that the code is behaving as expected. With manual testing, that is
    less the case since it is often done by a siloed QC department (even though it's
    often called QA). They tend to work on test definition in isolation from developers.
    That in itself leads to bigger problems caused by inevitably poor communication
    and the **police syndrome**, where testers are not trying to help the team to
    write applications with quality built in, but to find faults at the end of the
    process. The sooner we find problems, the cheaper it is to fix them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order for tests to run quickly and provide constant feedback, code needs
    to be organized in such a way that the methods, functions, and classes can be
    easily replaced with mocks and stubs. A common word for this type of replacements
    of the actual code is **test double**. The speed of execution can be severely
    affected with external dependencies; for example, our code might need to communicate
    with the database. By mocking external dependencies, we are able to increase that
    speed drastically. Whole unit test suite execution should be measured in minutes,
    if not seconds. Designing the code in a way that can be easily mocked and stubbed
    forces us to structure that code better by applying a separation of concerns.

    Setting up databases, web servers, external APIs, and other dependencies that

    documentation. In most cases, it is much easier to find out what the code does
    by looking at tests than at the implementation itself. What is the purpose of
    some methods? Look at the tests associated with it. What is the desired functionality
    of some part of the application UI? Look at the tests associated with it. Documentation

    is to avoid duplication. If details of the system can be obtained by reading the
    code, other types of documentation can provide quick guidelines and a high-level
    overview. Non-code documentation should answer questions such as what the general
    purpose of the system is and what technologies are used by the system. In many
    cases, a simple `README` is enough to provide the quick start that developers
    need. Sections such as project description, environment setup, installation, and
    build and packaging instructions are very helpful for newcomers. From there on,
    code is the bible.

    afterwards. CI solves the problem of incorrect test documentation, but it does
    not ensure that all functionality is documented. For this reason (among many others),
    test documentation should be created in the TDD fashion. If all functionality
    is defined as tests before the implementation code is written and the execution
    of all tests is successful, then tests act as a complete and up-to-date information
    source that can be used by developers.

    white-box testing. This division is important since it also divides testers into
    those who do know how to write or at least read code (white-box testing) and those
    who don't (black-box testing). In some cases, testers can do both types. However,
    more often than not, they do not know how to code so the documentation that is
    usable by developers is not usable by them. If documentation needs to be decoupled
    from the code, unit tests are not a good match. That is one of the reasons why
    BDD came in to being.

    the best ways to provide this type of documentation. The ability to act as acceptance
    criteria (written before the code), be executed frequently (preferably on every
    commit), and be written in a natural language makes BDD stories not only always
    up-to-date, but usable by those who do not want to inspect the code.

    works as expected. This does not mean that applications written using TDD do not
    have bugs—they do. All applications do. However, when that happens, it is easy
    to isolate them by simply looking for the code that is not covered by tests.

    is to write additional tests.

    tests than spending time debugging line by line until the culprit is found.

- en: In this chapter, you got the general understanding of TDD practice and insights
    into what TDD is and what it isn't. You learned that it is a way to design code
    through a short and repeatable cycle called Red-Green-Refactor. Failure is an
    expected state that should not only be embraced, but enforced throughout the TDD
    process. This cycle is so short that we move from one phase to another with great
    speed.

- en: While code design is the main objective, tests created throughout the TDD process
    are a valuable asset that should be utilized and severely impact our view of traditional
    testing practices. We went through the most common of those practices, such as
    white-box and black-box testing, tried to put them into the TDD perspective, and
    showed benefits that they can bring to each other.

    writing tests. Finally, we discussed how tests can and should be utilized as executable
    documentation and how TDD can make debugging much less necessary.

    environment and get an overview and comparison of different testing frameworks
    and tools.

    (**TDD**). It is a game of ping pong in which we are switching between tests and
    implementation code at great speed. We'll fail, then we'll succeed, and, finally,
    we'll improve.

    time. We'll write a test and see if it fails. Then, we'll write code that implements
    that test, run all the tests, and see them succeed. Finally, we'll refactor the
    code and try to make it better. This process will be repeated many times until
    all the requirements are successfully implemented.

    red state, code does not work; when in the green state, everything is working
    as expected, but not necessarily in the best possible way. Refactor is the phase
    when we know that features are well covered with tests and thus gives us the confidence
    to change it and make it better.

    focus on requirements and code design before writing the code. A test is a form
    of an executable documentation and can be used later on to get an understanding
    of what the code does or what are the intentions behind it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is a discrepancy between what tests expect from the code and what the implementation
    code actually does. To be more specific, there is no code that fulfills the expectation
    of the last test; we haven't written it yet. It is possible that at this stage
    all the tests are actually passing, but that's the sign of a problem.

    mistakenly, pass without the introduction of a new code. If the test is passing,
    then the feature already exists or the test is producing a false positive. If
    that's the case and the test actually always passes independently of the implementation,
    it is, in itself, worthless and should be removed.

    Do not try to make it perfect, nor try to spend too much time with it. If it's
    not well-written or is not optimum, that is still okay. It'll become better later
    on. What we're really trying to do is to create a safety net in the form of tests
    that are confirmed to pass. Do not try to introduce any functionality that was
    not described in the last test. To do that, we are required to go back to the
    first step and start with a new test. However, we should not write new tests until
    all the existing ones are passing.

    was written. The code that we just wrote might have made the last test pass while
    breaking something else. Running all the tests confirms not only that the implementation
    of the last test is correct, but also that it did not break the integrity of the
    application as a whole. This slow execution of the whole test suite is a sign
    of poorly written tests or having too much coupling in the code. Coupling prevents
    the easy isolation of external dependencies, thus increasing the time required
    for the execution of tests.

    since it can have many answers—it's hard to understand code, the illogical location
    of a piece of code, duplication, names that do not clearly state a purpose, long
    methods, classes that do too many things, and so on. The list can go on and on.
    No matter what the reasons are, the most important rule is that refactoring cannot
    change any existing functionality.

    At first glance, the whole process might seem too long or too complicated, but
    it is not. Experienced TDD practitioners write one to ten lines of code before
    switching to the next step. The whole cycle should last anything between a couple
    of seconds and no more than a few minutes. If it takes more than that, the scope
    of a test is too big and should be split into smaller chunks. Be fast, fail fast,
    correct, and repeat.

    two arrays are the same. Each of those asserts has many overloaded variations
    so that almost any type of Java object can be used.

- en: We did not use code coverage tools throughout this exercise. The reason is that
    we wanted you to be focused on the Red-Green-Refactor model. You wrote a test,
    saw it fail, wrote the implementation code, saw that all the tests were executed
    successfully, refactored the code whenever you saw an opportunity to make it better,
    and then you repeated the process. Did our tests cover all cases? That's something
    that code coverage tools such as JaCoCo can answer. Should you use those tools?
    Probably, only in the beginning. Let me clarify that. When you are starting with
    TDD, you will probably miss some tests or implement more than what the tests defined.
    In those cases, using code coverage is a good way to learn from your own mistakes.
    Later on, the more experienced you become with TDD, the less of a need you'll
    have for such tools. You'll write tests and just enough of the code to make them
    pass. Your coverage will be high with or without tools such as JaCoCo. There will
    be a small amount of code not covered by tests because you'll make a conscious
    decision about what is not worth testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We learned that the easiest way to develop something is by splitting it into
    very small chunks. The design was emerging from tests instead of using a big upfront
    approach. No line of the implementation code was written without writing a test
    first and seeing it fail. By confirming that the last test fails, we are confirming
    that it is valid (it's easy to make a mistake and write a test that is always
    successful) and the feature we are about to implement does not exist. After the
    test failed, we wrote the implementation of that test. While writing the implementation,
    we tried to make it a minimal one with the objective being to make the test pass,
    not to make the solution final. We repeated this process until we felt that there
    was a need to refactor the code. Refactoring did not introduce any new functionality
    (we did not change what the application does), but made the code more optimal
    and easier to read and maintain.

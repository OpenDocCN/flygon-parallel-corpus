- en: As we mentioned in the first recipe of this chapter, themed widgets have a specific
    API to customize their appearance. We cannot directly set options, such as the
    foreground color or the internal padding, because these values are set via the
    `ttk.Style` class.

    an uppercase `T` plus the widget name: `TButton` for `ttk.Button`, `TLabel` for

    that you check on the Python interpreter the classname by calling the `winfo_class()`
    method on the widget instance.'

    entry that forces them to write a string with a valid date format. Another solution
    would be adding several numeric entries for the day, month, and year, but this
    would also require some validations.

    however, we can opt to apply our knowledge of themed widgets to build a Calendar

- en: Deciding to learn Angular can be quite overwhelming. This is because the de
    facto way of writing an Angular app is by using a superset language, TypeScript,
    which is fairly new. Ironically, TypeScript simplifies how Angular apps are written
    by providing strict types (as seen in strictly typed languages such as Java),
    which improves the predictive behavior of the apps we write. This book is intended
    to assist you as a beginner/intermediate Angular developer with little or no knowledge
    of TypeScript or strict typing, in general, by explaining the core concepts of
    TypeScript.

- en: '[Chapter 1](dfb8cc54-b652-479b-8cf0-0ffa15ee3b0f.xhtml), *From Loose Types
    to Strict Types*, discusses the problems developers faced before TypeScript was
    introduced, and what problems TypeScript solves. We will do this by discussing
    loose types and their challenges, and show some examples of how these challenges
    were being tackled previously and why TypeScript is a better choice.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](1388eb32-f9cf-4efd-86fe-dc3f201ed039.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    Typescript*, gives a summary of TypeScript''s core concepts with practical examples
    on how to set up a vanilla JavaScript plus TypeScript project. All loosely typed
    examples in [Chapter 1](dfb8cc54-b652-479b-8cf0-0ffa15ee3b0f.xhtml), *From Loose
    Types to Strict Types*, will be rewritten with TypeScript to demonstrate TypeScript''s
    efficiency.'

    Types and Features*, takes a deep dive intobuilt-in TypeScript strict types that
    match existing JavaScript loose types. Each type will be discussed extensively
    with working examples, showing how it should be used and how it should work.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](466003d0-a079-4f5b-b8b5-8342eba35b82.xhtml), *Up and Running with
    Angular and TypeScript*, discusses how TypeScript applies to Angular. To do so,
    Angular needs to be up and running with the help of the CLI tool. In this chapter,
    we will discuss what it takes to have Angular and TypeScript work together. We
    will also cover the basic Angular concepts that you could find in a *Hello World*
    example.'

    with TypeScript*, discusses the concept of web components and how Angular builds
    on web components with TypeScript. We will see how to create components with classes,
    implement lifecycle hooks with TypeScript interfaces, and define components, metadetails
    using TypeScript decorators.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](70f76e99-3d5b-43d6-90ad-5ea049aa622c.xhtml), *Component Composition
    with TypeScript*, discusses how Angular is component-based. It explains that components
    are composed together as building blocks to make a fully functional app. We will
    discuss modularizing components using composition with examples and component
    interaction (data transfer and events). In doing so, we will see how TypeScript
    is used to keep us in check with all these moving parts.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](f6baa88b-3002-4e76-8073-06863d0cb16a.xhtml), *Separating Concerns
    with Typed Services*, discusses how it’s bad practice to allow our logic to live
    in our components. In such a case, Angular allows you to provide API methods via
    services that these components can consume. We will discuss how TypeScript helps
    us create contracts (using types) between these API methods and the components.'

    Event Handling with TypeScript*, explains how the Angular form module enables
    us to write predictable typed forms with TypeScript, which is a perfect means
    of collecting data from our app users. We will also see how to use typed DOM events
    (for example, click, mouseover, and keydown) to respond to user interactions.'

    of Angular and how they are best used with TypeScript. You will learn how to build
    custom directives and pipes in Angular with types and decorators.'

    for SPA,*explains Single Page Applications (SPAs), which are built by handing
    over routing to the client with JavaScript rather than the server. We will discuss
    how, with Angular and TypeScript, we can use the router module to build multiple
    view apps with just a single server route.'

    You will learn how to make an HTTP request right from our Angular app. Data fetched
    from this request can then be rendered by components.'

    of TypeScript. These features will be used extensively while working on Angular
    projects. TypeScript is completely optional when it comes to building Angular
    projects but, trust me, just using JavaScript is not a route you will want to
    take after experiencing how TypeScript simplifies the development story.

    from a beginner's perspective, the ecosystem may overwhelm you with lots and lots
    of terms. Most of these terms represent the tools that make Angular work, and
    not Angular itself. Webpack, linters, TypeScript, typings, build processes, and
    so on, are some confusing terms that may turn you off at the beginning of your
    Angular journey.

- en: For this reason, the Angular team built an all-in-one tool to help you pay less
    attention to those surrounding tools but more attention to building your project.
    It's known as the Angular CLI, and with just a few CLI commands you're building
    your app. The time spent on managing JavaScript tools these days is alarming,
    and you don't want to get caught up in that mess as a beginner (or even a professional).

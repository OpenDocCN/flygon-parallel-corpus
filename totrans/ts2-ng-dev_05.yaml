    This knowledge is not enough to build robust applications. We need to delve a
    little more deeply into Angular's exciting components and see how TypeScript makes
    working with components a lot easier.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most methods you will create in classes must be called somewhere by you, which
    is the expected pattern in programming. This is not the case in what Angular defines
    as lifecycle hooks. These hooks are methods that you create for Angular to call
    them internally, depending on the current state of a component/directive. They
    are created in a component's or directive's class.

- en: '`ngOnChanges`: Remember how properties are bound to components. These properties
    are reactive, meaning that, when they change, the view is updated as well. This
    lifecycle method is called when any property, bound to a view, is changed. Therefore,
    you can manipulate what happens before the changes are reflected.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`ngOnInit`: This is the most common lifecycle. It is called after a component
    has been initialized with the default property bindings. Hence, it is called after
    the first `ngOnChanges`.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`ngDoCheck`: Reactivity (change detection) is usually handled for you, but
    in extreme cases where it''s not, you need to handle it yourself. Use `ngDoCheck` to
    detect and act upon changes that Angular can''t or won''t detect on its own.'

- en: We are trying to simulate an asynchronous behavior, where values are resolved
    in the future. This kind of operation is best done when the application is initialized
    and that's why we are handling this in the `ngOnInit` method. Once the component
    is ready, Angular calls this hook, which will set the item array after three seconds.

    is like `*ngFor` but is used to display DOM elements based on a Boolean property
    on the component.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Angular 1.x, touching the DOM seemed mysterious; not like you couldn't, but
    somehow it comes back to bite you. This is ironic because what we do as web designers/developers
    is paint the DOM, and that cannot be possible without manipulating it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Angular 2+, it became quite easy to do this. Angular abstracts the DOM
    and gives you the shallow copy to mess around with. It's then responsible for
    putting it back without hurting anyone. It becomes even more interesting with
    TypeScript because your editor can hint most of the DOM property methods for you.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right in the constructor, we create an instance of `ElementRef` as `el`, which
    we can use to interact with the DOM. The `ngAfterContentInit`function is called
    after the DOM contents are ready, which makes it the perfect candidate to handle
    DOM manipulations on startup. Hence, we grab a reference to the DOM there.

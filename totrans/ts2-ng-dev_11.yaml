  prefs:

    of users together with their emails, and phone numbers. The users will also have
    a true or false state, indicating whether they are available or unavailable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Build a user directory with Angular
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The application we are about to build will have a REST API which will be created
    during the course of this example. In this simple example, we'll be creating a
    `users` app which will be quite simple. The app will basically be a table which
    contains a list of users together with their email addresses and phone numbers.
    Each user in the table will have an *active*state whose value is a boolean. We
    will be able to change the *active* state of a particular user from false to true
    and vice versa. The app will give us the ability to add new users and also delete
    users from the table. Just like the previous example, diskDB will be used as the
    database for this example. We will have an Angular service which contains methods
    that will be responsible for communicating with the REST end points. These methods
    will be responsible for making `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` requests to
    the REST API. The first method in the service will be responsible for making a
    `get` request to the API. This will enable us to retrieve all the users from the
    back end. Next, we will have another method that makes a `post` request to the
    API. This will enable us to add new users to the array of existing users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next method we shall have will be responsible for making a `delete` request
    to the API in order to enable the deletion of a user. Finally, we shall have a
    method that makes a `put` request to the API. This will be the method that gives
    us the ability to edit/modify the state of a user. In order to make these requests
    to the REST API, we will have to make use of the HttpModule. The aim of this section
    is to solidify your knowledge of HTTP. As a JavaScript and, in fact, an Angular
    developer, you are bound to make interactions with APIs and web servers almost
    all the time. So much data used by developers today is in form of APIs and in
    order to make interactions with these APIs, we need to constantly make use of
    HTTP requests. As a matter of fact, HTTP is the foundation of data communication
    for the web.

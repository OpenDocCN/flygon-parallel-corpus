    the aspect of breaking down commonly used functionality into reusable modules.
    That is exactly what frameworks do. They come with a lot of reusable modules and
    enforce a standard structure for the code so that it will be easier for developers
    across the world to go through and understand the application.

    of developers across the world. So, the effort of developers to incorporate the
    newer bug fixes and features of underlying languages is minimized to a point where
    we just need to upgrade the framework version which is being used by the application.
    So, the use of web frameworks for building web applications brings a lot of advantages
    to the development and maintenance phases of a web application.

    a simple `console.log()` message. That's it! Again, make sure to save this file

    The idea behind middleware is that it acts like a stack of filters that every
    request to your server passes through. Every request passes through each filter
    and each filter can perform a specific task against the request before it passes
    through to the next filter.

    search through [https://www.npmjs.org/](https://www.npmjs.org/) first, as there's
    a fairly big chance someone else has already done the work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    framework, it documents various types of middleware that we would simply categorize

    level, it is a function that is called on receiving a request in the `http.createServer`
    method. Further, we need to write a function that accepts four parameters: `err`,
    `req`, `res`, and `next`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first parameter is an error object, and if there were any stack errors prior
    to your middleware running, that error would be passed to your middleware so that
    you can handle it accordingly. This is an optional parameter; hence, we can skip
    it if no error handling is required for the specific implementation of functionality.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The order that the middleware is called in is very important. Again, using the
    concept of filters as a request that passes through each filter, you want to be
    sure that they are performing their responsibilities in the correct order. A great
    example of this is implementing a cookie parser before a session handler, since
    sessions typically rely on cookies to maintain states with a user between requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another great example of how the order of middleware is important involves error
    handling. If any of your middleware encounters an error, they will simply pass
    that error along to the next middleware in the stack. If the last middleware,
    regardless of what it is, doesn't gracefully handle that error, it will basically
    show up in your application as a stack trace (and that's bad). Having an error
    handler configured as one of the last middleware is like saying "*if everything
    else fails, and at any point in the previous middleware a failure occurs, deal
    with it gracefully*."

    that we assign a route value of `/images/:image_id` that basically equates to
    `/image/ANYVALUE` in the browser address bar. When we write the `image.index`
    controller, you will see how to retrieve the value for `:image_id` and use it
    within the `controller` function itself.

    omit the idea of using controllers and just define your callbacks as inline anonymous
    functions; however, as your routes grow, this file will get larger and larger,
    and the code will start to become a mess. It's always a good practice to break
    your code up into as many small and manageable modules as possible to keep yourself
    sane!

    a visitor points their browser to `yourdomain.com/routepath`—the browser sends
    a `GET` request to the server by default. The other three `router.post` routes
    are defined to handle when the browser posts a request to the server, typically
    done via a HTML form submission.

    called `index`. The `function` signature for `index` is the signature that is
    required for every route using Express. A first parameter is a request object
    and a second parameter is a response object. Every detail specific to the request
    that the browser sent to the server will be available via the request object.

    that was declared earlier. You will use the response object to send a response
    back to the client—this may be a rendered HTML page, static asset, JSON data,
    an error, or whatever you determine. For now, our controllers just respond with
    a simple text so you can see that they are all working.

- en: By default, Express can and will happily render static HTML documents and serve
    them back to the client. However, unless you're building a purely static, content-driven
    site, which is doubtful, you're more than likely going to want to render your
    HTML dynamically. That is, you want to generate portions of HTML on the fly as
    pages are requested, perhaps using loops, conditional statements, data-driven
    content, and so on. In order to render dynamic HTML pages, you need to use a rendering
    engine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the syntax it uses to display data, namely, double pairs of braces, `{{` and

    at run time based on data passed to it. Consider the following example:'

- en: First, using the Express `app` object that was passed into the `configure` function,
    we define our rendering engine of choice by calling the engine function of `app`.
    The first parameter to the `engine` function is the file extension that the rendering
    engine should look for, namely, `handlebars`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second parameter builds the engine by calling the `express-hbs` module's
    `create` function. This `create` function takes an `options` object as a parameter,
    and this `options` object defines a number of constants for our server. Most importantly,
    we will define which layout is our default layout and also where our layouts will
    be stored. If you recall, in `server.js` we used `app.set` to set a `Views` property
    of our `app` that pointed to the current working directory `+/Views`. This setting
    is used when we configure the options for our rendering engine as well. You'll
    notice that the `partialsDir` property uses an array (with a single item) and
    a single string value for `layoutsDir`. Both of these methods are interchangeable,
    and I just wanted to demonstrate that you could have more than one partial directory,
    and it could just be an array of string values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that set, our server now knows that any time we try to render a HTML page
    that has a file extension of `handlebars`, it will use the Handlebars engine to
    perform the rendering. This means that we need to be sure to use Handlebars-specific
    syntax in our dynamic HTML pages.

    in the `app.set('View engine')` function are identical.

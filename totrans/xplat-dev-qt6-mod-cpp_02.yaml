    framework designed to create great software applications with uniform **user interfaces**
    (**UIs**) for desktop, embedded, and mobile platforms. It provides developers
    with a great set of tools to design and build great applications without worrying
    about platform dependency. In this chapter, you will learn the basics about the
    framework, its history, and how to install Qt on different platforms. You will
    learn what Qt is and why it is beneficial to use it. By the end of the chapter,
    you will be able to install Qt and get started on your platform of choice.'

- en: Qt is a cross-platform software development framework for desktop, embedded,
    and mobile platforms. It follows the philosophy of *code less, create more, and
    deploy everywhere.* It supports platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, VxWorks,
    QNX, Android, iOS, and so on. The software also supports several **microcontroller
    units** (**MCUs**) from NXP, Renesas, and STMicroelectronics running on bare metal
    or FreeRTOS.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Qt was born as an attempt to provide a uniform **graphical user interface**
    (**GUI**) with the same look, feel, and functionality across different platforms.
    Qt accomplishes that by providing a framework to write code once and ensure that
    it runs on other platforms with minimal or no modifications. It is not a programming
    language, but rather a framework written in C++. The Qt framework and tools are
    dual-licensed under open source and commercial licenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Qt uses a modular approach to group related functionalities together. Qt Essentials
    are the foundation of Qt on all platforms. These modules are general and useful
    for most Qt-based applications. Essential modules are available for open source
    usage. Examples of Qt Essentials modules are Qt Core, Qt GUI, Qt QML, Qt Widgets,
    and so on. There are also special-purpose add-on modules that provide specific
    functionalities and come with certain license obligations. Examples of add-on
    modules are Qt 3D, Qt Bluetooth, Qt Charts, Qt Data Visualization, and more. As
    well as this, there are value-added modules such as Qt Automotive Suite, Qt for
    Device Creation, and Qt for MCUs, among others available under the commercial
    license.

    and major changes. Qt 6 is the new major version of Qt. Its main goals are to
    remain prepared for the requirements coming in 2020 and beyond, remove obsolete
    modules, and be more maintainable. With this focus, there are architectural changes
    in Qt 6 that may break some level of backward compatibility with earlier versions.

    However, Qt is much more than a GUI framework. It not only comprises a GUI module,
    but also a set of modules to make application development faster and easier to

    of Qt, tools, and Add-On modules to install based on the chosen license. The online
    installer doesn't contain the Qt components, but it is a downloader client to
    download all the relevant files. You can install once the download is complete.
    You will require a Qt account to download and install Qt. An evaluation version
    for the commercial Qt gives you free trial-period access, with all commercial
    packages and access to official Qt support. The installer requires you to sign
    in with your Qt account. If you don't have a Qt account, you can sign up during
    the installation process. The installer fetches the license attached to the account
    from the Qt server and lists down modules according to your license. If you are
    new to Qt, then we recommend that you start with the open source version.
  prefs: []

    and add-ons relevant for the platform. Due to the official policy changes, open
    source offline installers are not available any more since Qt 5.15\. If you have
    a commercial license, then you can provide the credentials during the installation
    process. You can locate your license key in your **Qt account** web portal.
